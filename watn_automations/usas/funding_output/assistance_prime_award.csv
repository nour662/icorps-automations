OVER 50 INHERITED NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS INCLUDING MYOPATHIES, MUSCULAR DYSTROPHIES, AND METABOLIC MUSCLE DISORDERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH A MONOGENIC UNDERPINNING, RESULTING FROM MUTATIONS IN A SINGLE GENE. OLIGONUCLEOTIDE THERAPEUTICS OFFER THE POTENTIAL TO CORRECT MANY OF THESE DISORDERS BY SPECIFICALLY TARGETING THE MUTATED DISEASE- CAUSING GENE. A MAJOR LIMITING FACTOR THAT REMAINS IS THE ABILITY TO DELIVER EFFECTIVE DOSES OF THESE LARGE HYDROPHILIC MOLECULES INTO AFFECTED MUSCLE CELLS. MUSCLE-NAV WILL BE COMPOSED OF MIRECULE’S ANTIBODY TECHNOLOGY DIRECTLY CONJUGATED TO A THERAPEUTIC OLIGONUCLEOTIDE. THE ANTIBODY WILL BE TARGETED TO A MUSCLE EXPRESSED RECEPTOR THAT INDUCES UPTAKE VIA ENDOCYTOSIS UPON BINDING. ONCE ENDOCYTOSED OUR NOVEL PROTEIN AND CONJUGATION CHEMISTRY AIDS IN ENDOSOMAL ESCAPE TO THE CYTOPLASM.  THE THIRD MOST COMMON INHERITED MUSCLE DISORDER IS FACIOSCAPULOHUMERAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (FSHD) AN ORPHAN INDICATION IN THE US, WITH ABOUT 20,000 PATIENTS. FSHD RESULTS FROM INHERITED MUTATIONS THAT LEAD TO INAPPROPRIATE EXPRESSION OF THE DOUBLE HOMEOBOX 4 (DUX4) GENE. THE ABERRANT EXPRESSION OF DUX4 IS SEVERELY TOXIC TO MUSCLE TISSUES, RESULTING IN OXIDATIVE STRESS AND APOPTOSIS OF MUSCLE CELLS DEGRADING MUSCLE FUNCTION. DUX4 IS A TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR AND IS NOT DIRECTLY “DRUGGABLE” BY TRADITIONAL SMALL MOLECULES OR BIOLOGIC THERAPEUTICS. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE DISPLAYED THAT ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDE (ASO) THERAPY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DIRECTLY REPRESS DUX4, REVERSING MUSCLE PATHOLOGY IN PRE-CLINICAL MODELS. HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT HURDLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT IS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF DELIVERY. TO VALIDATE OUR MUSCLE-NAV PLATFORM WE PROPOSE TO DELIVER OUR (ASO) TARGETING DUX4 (MIRECULE CANDIDATE MC-DX4) FOR THE TREATMENT OF FSHD.  IN PHASE 1 OF THE FAST TRACK SBIR, WE WILL FIRST DISCOVER NOVEL ANTIBODIES FOR TEN RECEPTORS WITH SELECTIVE MUSCLE EXPRESSION THROUGH PHAGE DISPLAY SCREENING (AIM 1). WE WILL DEMONSTRATE SELECTIVE DELIVERY AND KNOCKDOWN IN MUSCLE CELLS IN VITRO (AIM 2). THEN SCREEN FIVE CONJUGATES FOR MUSCLE SPECIFIC BIODISTRIBUTION, EFFECTIVE DELIVERY AND KNOCKDOWN IN AN FSHD MOUSE MODEL, AND SAFETY IN MICE TO SELECT A SINGLE LEAD ANTIBODY CONJUGATE FOR MUSCLE-NAV (AIM 3). IN PHASE 2 OF THE FAST TRACK SBIR, WE WILL OPTIMIZE SCALE-UP, PROCESS DEVELOPMENT, AND CMC RELEASE TESTS FOR MUSCLE-NAV AND MC-DX4 (AIM 4). WE WILL USE THIS HIGH-QUALITY AGENT TO CHARACTERIZE PK PROFILES IN NON-HUMAN PRIMATES (NHPS), PK/PD PROFILES IN A MOUSE MODEL OF FSHD, AND MTD/ DOSING RANGE/TK PROFILES IN RATS (AIM 5). WE WILL ALSO DEMONSTRATE THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND LONG- TERM THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY OF MC-DX4 IN TWO MOUSE MODELS OF FSHD (AIM 6). THE COMPLETION OF THESE STUDIES WILL CREATE A COMPELLING DATA PACKAGE WE WILL USE TO MARKET CO-DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSING DEALS FOR OUR MUSCLE- NAV PLATFORM, AND ENABLE OUR PRE-IND MEETING FOR MC-DX4 AS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR FSHD.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,R,SMALL BUSINESS,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R44NS119147_7529/,2024-10-04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HEAD AND NECK SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA (HNSCC) IS THE 6TH MOST COMMON FORM OF CANCER WORLDWIDE. GREATER THAN HALF OF PATIENTS PRESENT WITH LOCOREGIONALLY ADVANCED FORM OF DISEASE, WITH AN AVERAGE 5-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE OF ~40%. CETUXIMAB IS CURRENTLY APPROVED TO TREAT THIS SUBSET OF PATIENTS BUT ONLY OFFERS MILD TREATMENT BENEFIT. THIS IS PARTLY DUE TO EGFR TARGETED THERAPY OFTEN BEING COMPENSATED FOR BY OVEREXPRESSION OF OTHER GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTORS (GFRS) SUCH AS MET AND IGF1R. HOWEVER, WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT MIR-30-5P SIMULTANEOUSLY TARGETS AND REPRESS ALL THREE OF THESE GFRS. THE RATIONALE FOR MIR- 30-5P REPLACEMENT THERAPY IS THAT IT WILL BE SUPERIOR IN ITS ABILITY TO TREAT HETEROGENEOUS LATE-STAGE HNSCC DUE TO ITS ABILITY TO REGULATE NOT ONLY EGFR, BUT ALSO MET, IGF-1R, AND OVER TWO DOZEN OTHER MRNAS CONFIRMED TO BE DEREGULATED IN TUMOR TISSUE AND ASSOCIATED WITH PROLIFERATION, ADHESION, MIGRATION, EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX REMODELING, AND DIFFERENTIATION. MC-30 HAS THREE INDEPENDENT MECHANISMS OF ACTION, INHIBITION OF EGFR SIGNALING AND INDUCTION OF ADCC BY THE CETUXIMAB ANTIBODY COMPONENT, AND IF THE ARC IS INTERNALIZED THE RNA PAYLOAD CAN SUPPRESS SEVERAL ONCOGENIC MECHANISMS AND KILL THE CANCER CELL. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED IN PRE-CLINICAL MOUSE MODELS THAT MC-30 BETTER THAN DOUBLES TUMOR GROWTH INHIBITION AND SURVIVAL COMPARED TO CETUXIMAB. WE HAVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT IN PRELIMINARY TOXICOLOGY STUDIES THAT MC- 30 HAS A SIMILAR SAFETY PROFILE IN MICE AND NHPS TO THE PARENT ANTIBODY. IN THIS DIRECT TO PHASE 2 APPLICATION WE WILL; 1) VALIDATE MC-30 EFFICACY IN DIVERSE PDX AND SYNGENEIC MOUSE MODELS COMPARED TO STANDARD OF CARE. 2) EXECUTE PROCESS DEVELOPMENT AND SCALE UP OF OUR MC-30 ARC AND CREATE A PANEL OF CMC RELEASE TESTS FOR GMP MANUFACTURING. 3) PK BIOANALYTICAL METHOD TECH TRANSFER, AND GLP VALIDATION FOR IND AND PHASE 1 STUDIES. 4) PERFORM NON-GLP PK AND MAXIMUM TOLERATED DOSE RANGE FINDING STUDIES IN NHPS.

COPD IS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH GLOBALLY, WITH OVER 3 MILLION FATALITIES AND AN ANNUAL COST OF $52 BILLION IN THE U.S. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE JOHNS HOPKINS CLINICAL RESEARCH NETWORK (JHCRN), THIS PROJECT AIMS TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY TO UNDERSERVED PATIENTS IN THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION. ALIGNING WITH THE NIH'S EMPHASIS ON IMPROVING PATIENT ADHERENCE, THE PROJECT CENTERS ON ENHANCING ADHERENCE TO REMOTE MONITORING AND EARLY SYMPTOM RECOGNITION TO REDUCE COPD READMISSIONS AND HEALTHCARE COSTS.  COPD SYMPTOMS INCLUDE DYSPNEA, COUGHING, AND SPUTUM PRODUCTION. THE CURRENT 23% READMISSION RATE POSES A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. EARLY SYMPTOM DETECTION CAN FACILITATE HOME TREATMENT, REDUCING READMISSIONS AND COSTS. STANDARD LUNG FUNCTION ASSESSMENTS REQUIRE MEDICAL EXPERTISE AND ARE NOT SUITED FOR CONTINUOUS, REMOTE MONITORING. EARLY DETECTION OF DETERIORATING LUNG FUNCTION ENABLES TIMELY INTERVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF COPD SEVERITY.  THIS PROJECT EXTENDS OUR INTEL AWARD-WINNING, PATENTED WIRELESS WEARME SYSTEM TO CAPTURE PHYSIOLOGIC BASELINES AND POTENTIAL ACUTE CHANGES IN COPD PATIENTS. WEARME USES A BODY AREA SENSOR NETWORK WITH MULTIMODAL SENSING CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS DIGITAL STETHOSCOPE, BODY KINEMATICS, AND ELECTROCARDIOGRAM. WE WILL EXPLORE OUR SENSING MODALITIES TO CAPTURE BILATERAL BIOMARKERS AND CHANGES IN LUNG FUNCTION, RESPIRATION PERIOD, AND USER ACTIVITY.  IN PHASE I, WE WILL ASSESS LUNG FUNCTION AND USER RESPIRATION IN REAL-TIME DURING ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (ADL), LIKE WALKING AND STAIR CLIMBING, IN AN IN-CLINIC CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. THE GOAL IS TO EVALUATE PATIENTS' PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND ABILITY TO PERFORM ADL FOR THE PHASE II LONGITUDINAL STUDY. IN PHASE II, WE WILL VALIDATE OUR WEARME SYSTEM THROUGH REMOTE MONITORING, USABILITY, AND ADHERENCE STUDIES, ASSOCIATING CHANGES IN BIOMARKERS WITH ADL. TO ENSURE HIGH ADHERENCE RATES, STRATEGIES SUCH AS PUSH NOTIFICATIONS, PATIENT ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS, AND INCENTIVES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. FOR PATIENTS WHO DO NOT OWN A SUITABLE SMARTPHONE, WE ARE PREPARED TO PROVIDE A LOANER DEVICE FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY. THE REVISED PROPOSAL EMPHASIZES THE UNIQUE ADVANTAGES OF THE WEARME-PRO SYSTEM OVER TRADITIONAL HAND-HELD SPIROMETERS. UNLIKE HAND-HELD SPIROMETERS THAT PROVIDE ONLY INTERMITTENT DATA, OUR WEARABLE DEVICE PROVIDES A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF A PATIENT'S RESPIRATORY HEALTH OVER TIME. THE DEVICE ALSO CAPTURES COUGH FREQUENCY, A KNOWN PRECURSOR TO EXACERBATIONS. SUCH CONTINUOUS MONITORING ENABLES HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO TRACK CHANGES IN THE PATIENT'S RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS AND RESPOND PROMPTLY TO POTENTIAL EXACERBATIONS.  WE HAVE INSTITUTED REGULAR MEETINGS, SPECIFIC TASK ASSIGNMENTS, AND CLEAR COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS TO ENSURE EFFICIENT COLLABORATION AMONG THE TEAM MEMBERS. THE RESULTS OF THIS SBIR FAST-TRACK PROJECT WILL SUPPORT FDA SUBMISSION FOR 510(K) CLEARANCE AND COMMERCIALIZATION, LEVERAGING PARTNERSHIPS WITH JOHNS HOPKINS, TIDALHEALTH, AND TOWER HEALTH TO MARKET OUR SOLUTION THROUGH A PRESCRIPTION MODEL. BY ADDRESSING PATIENT ADHERENCE, THIS PROJECT AIMS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT COPD MANAGEMENT AND PROMOTE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. 1",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,R,SMALL BUSINESS,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R44HL172444_7529/,2024-10-04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THE MOST PREVALENT MODALITY OF RENAL REPLACEMENT, HEMODIALYSIS, REQUIRES ACCESS TO THE CIRCULATION THROUGH WHICH DIALYSIS MACHINERY IS CONNECTED. THE PREFERRED METHOD OF ACCESS IS AN ARTERIOVENOUS (AV) FISTULA AS IT CONFERS LOWER RATES OF MORTALITY, INFECTION AND INTERVENTIONS, HOWEVER THEY ARE THE MOST CHALLENGING FOR DIALYSIS TECHNICIANS TO CANNULATE. CANNULATION DAMAGE IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY CAUSES OF AV FISTULA COMPLICATIONS AND FAILURE. CANNULATION FAILURES AND INJURY OCCUR IN 91% OF PATIENTS WITHIN 6 MONTHS. THESE INJURIES CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS, SUCH AS HEMATOMA, INFECTION, AND ANEURYSM FORMATION INCLUDING DEATH FROM HEMORRHAGE, WITH A SECONDARY IMPACT ON MORBIDITY, HOSPITALIZATION, ACCESS REVISION, AND LOSS OF ACCESS. THE ANNUAL RATE OF MAJOR INFILTRATION IS 5.2%, WITH EACH INCIDENT LEADING TO AN EXTRA 97 DAYS OF CATHETER DEPENDENCY AND A MEAN OF 2.4 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, SURGERY APPOINTMENTS, OR INTERVENTIONS. WHEN FACTORING IN THE ADDITIONAL CATHETER TIME AND SECONDARY INTERVENTIONS, THE FINANCIAL IMPACT IS $21,441 PER MAJOR INFILTRATION. ULTRASOUND HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE OUTCOMES BY REDUCING CVC TIME BY >30% (50 DAYS) AND INFECTIONS BY 37%. HOWEVER, THIS WAS IN THE HANDS OF NEPHROLOGY PHYSICIANS IN A STUDY SETTING AND CURRENT ULTRASOUND OPTIONS ARE TOO CHALLENGING FOR DIALYSIS TECHNICIANS AND ARE THEREFORE NOT USED.

THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO PERFORM DIALYSIS USES AN ARTERIOVENOUS FISTULA TO CONNECT TO DIALYSIS MACHINES, BUT FISTULA USE IS LIMITED BY THE MALFUNCTIONS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING CREATION (MATURATION FAILURE), WHICH CAN RENDER UP TO 70% OF ALL CREATED FISTULAS UNUSABLE. ULTRASOUND MONITORING OF THE FISTULA AFTER IT HAS BEEN CREATED CAN AVOID MALFUNCTION BY DETECTING PROBLEMS THAT CAN BE FIXED WITH MINIMALLY INVASIVE OUTPATIENT PROCEDURES. UNFORTUNATELY, THOUGH ULTRASOUND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE THE FAILURE RATE TO ONLY 22%, THE ULTRASOUNDS EXAMINATIONS USED TO DETECT THESE PROBLEMS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THEY CAN ONLY BE PERFORMED AT SPECIALIZED VASCULAR LABORATORIES BY ULTRASOUND SPECIALISTS – NOT IN THE DIALYSIS CLINIC. ADDITIONALLY, DIALYSIS PATIENTS ARE ONLY 12-33% COMPLIANT WITH VISITS OUTSIDE OF ROUTINE DIALYSIS SESSIONS DUE TO TRANSPORTATION AND FINANCIAL LIMITATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES, ULTRASOUND SCANS ARE NOT CURRENTLY ROUTINELY PERFORMED IN THE POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD. IF ULTRASOUND WERE LESS EXPENSIVE, MORE ACCESSIBLE, AND AVAILABLE IN THE DIALYSIS CLINIC, IT COULD BE PERFORMED DURING THE MATURATION PHASE AND ELIMINATE MOST EARLY FISTULA FAILURES, MINIMIZE CATHETER CONTACT TIME, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL BENEFIT FOR PATIENTS AND SUBSTANTIAL COST SAVINGS. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A DUAL-COMPONENT ULTRASOUND-BASED SOLUTION, ECHOMARK LP AND ECHOSURE V2, THAT CAN BE UTILIZED ANYWHERE AND DOES NOT REQUIRE EXPERT ULTRASONOGRAPHERS. OUR SYSTEM CAN BE USED TO EXAMINE A FISTULA DURING ROUTINE DIALYSIS SESSIONS BY THE SAME DIALYSIS TECHS THAT ARE ADMINISTERING DIALYSIS. THIS MEANS THAT ULTRASOUND MONITORING OF A FISTULA IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AFTER FISTULA CREATION CAN BE DONE FOR LITTLE ADDITIONAL COST AS OFTEN AS 3 TIMES PER WEEK. WE HAVE PROVEN THAT ECHOSURE V1 WORKS IN HUMAN FISTULAS AND WE HAVE RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE, HOWEVER THE DEVICE MUST BE MODIFIED FOR COMMERCIAL VIABILITY. SPECIFICALLY, WE MUST: 1) LOWER ULTRASOUND SYSTEM COST, BASED ON RECOGNITION OF A NEED TO INSTALL A LARGER NUMBER OF SYSTEMS AT DIALYSIS CENTERS; 2) INCREASE PORTABILITY, BASED ON CLINICIAN FEEDBACK ON THE NEED TO EASILY TRANSPORT THE SYSTEM BETWEEN LOCATIONS (E.G. HOME HEMODIALYSIS); AND 3) INTEGRATE WITH COMMON PACS/EMRS LIKE EPIC TO ENABLE STREAMLINED WEEKLY DOCUMENTATION OF FISTULA FLOW DATA AND BILLING FOR REIMBURSEMENT. IN THIS WORK WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A NEW VERSION OF THE ECHOSURE SYSTEM (ESV2) TO MEET THESE NEEDS. THIS WILL ALLOW RAPID, ACCURATE AND FREQUENT SURVEILLANCE OF ARTERIOVENOUS FISTULAE IN ANY SETTING (E.G. DIALYSIS UNIT, HOME, CLINIC, ETC.) TO MAXIMIZE MATURATION RATES AND PREVENT FISTULA FAILURE. IN THIS CRP PROPOSAL, WE WILL (1) DEVELOP A NEW HARDWARE SOLUTION FOR THE ULTRASOUND SYSTEM AND 3D TRANSDUCER WHICH DECREASES COST BY 50%, REDUCES FORM FACTOR SIZE AND WEIGHT, AND ENABLES EASE OF TRANSPORTATION FOR USE OF ECHOSURE IN DIALYSIS UNITS AND DURING HOME HEMODIALYSIS; (2) PORT EXISTING ECHOSURE SOFTWARE TO THE ESV2 HARDWARE PLATFORM AND PERFORM ALL VERIFICATION & VALIDATION ACTIVITIES NECESSARY FOR FDA CLEARANCE AND CLINICAL USE; AND (3) CREATE PACS AND EHR INTEGRATIONS FOR ECHOSURE THAT INTERFACE DIRECTLY WITH CURRENT PROVIDER SYSTEMS TO ENABLE BILLING AND RECORDS STORAGE TO SUPPORT DOCUMENTATION, UNIFIED PATIENT RECORDS AND AUDIT COMPLIANCE. OVERALL IMPACT: ESV2 WILL ALLOW RAPID AND EARLY DETECTION OF PROBLEMS WITH ARTERIOVENOUS FISTULAS BEFORE MALFUNCTION IN THE MATURATION STAGE. THIS WILL BOTH IMPROVE THE SUCCESS RATE OF FISTULA MATURATION AND REDUCE CATHETER CONTACT TIME, THEREFORE ENABLING PATIENTS TO RECEIVE DIALYSIS VIA A FISTULA, RATHER THAN A CATHETER, WHICH LEADS TO REDUCED MORTALITY AND A 23% REDUCTION IN ANNUAL COSTS PER PAT",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,R,SMALL BUSINESS,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_SB1HL147423_7529/,2024-10-04,STE 200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THE MARKET IS PROJECTED TO REACH $35.8 BILLION BY 2026, AT AN ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 18.4%. END-USERS RANGE FROM ASTRONOMY TO AGRICULTURE, MANUFACTURES, AND THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATORS (E.G., DRONE COMPANIES). CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES ARE TOO COSTLY OR DO NOT POSSESS THE SIZE, WEIGHT, AND POWER (SWAP) PROPERTIES REQUIRED FOR PRACTICAL VALUE DELIVERY. FURTHERMORE, IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS OR IN APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE ABERRATION-FREE HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGES (E.G., DEFENSE-BASED IMAGING), CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES ON THE MARKET CANNOT MEET CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. THIS SOLUTION PROMISES TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES. AGRICULTURE AND DEFENSE ARE THE TWO LEADING MARKET APPLICATIONS AND REPRESENT THE PRIMARY ENTRY POINTS FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS PROJECT WILL ENABLE A TRANSFORMATION IN THE SPECTROSCOPY AND THE HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING (HSI) MARKET BY ENABLING LOW-COST, SUPERIOR IMAGE QUALITY SPECTROGRAPHS. THE PRODUCT WILL BE A NOVEL SPHERICAL TRANSMISSION GRATING SPECTROMETER (STGS) FOR HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING. PRELIMINARY STGS DESIGNS, INVENTED IN A COLLABORATION WITH ASTRONOMERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN LARGE TELESCOPE EMPLOY A COMBINATION OF A SPHERICAL MIRROR AND A SPHERICALLY-CURVED TRANSMISSION GRATING TO DELIVER FULLY ABERRATION-CORRECTED SPECTRAL IMAGES WITH NO FIELD DISTORTION. CHALLENGES TO THEIR PRODUCTION ARE THE DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND TESTING OF THIS SPHERICAL VOLUME PHASE HOLOGRAPHIC (VPH) GRATING. THESE SPECTROGRAPHS REPRESENT A NEW PARADIGM IN OPTICAL SPECTROMETER DESIGN, AND THE TEAM HAS DEVELOPED A SUITE OF STGS DESIGNS THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO BUILD A NEW GENERATION OF DISTORTION AND ABERRATION FREE SPECTROGRAPHS THAT ARE SIMPLE, SMALL, AND LIGHTWEIGHT. THE KEY OBJECTIVES FOR THIS PROJECT ARE: 1) TO DEVELOP A CURVED GRATING MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO MATCH DESIGN AND MARKET GOALS, 2) TO DESIGN AND FABRICATE A PROTOTYPE TESTBED HSI FOR DESIGN VALIDATION AND HIGH-THROUGHPUT QUALITY TESTING, AND 3) TO CREATE FINALIZED OPTICAL DESIGNS FOR STGSS IN THE F/2 TO F/2.5 RANGE.

THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO CREATE A MEDICATION DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR SOFT TISSUE TRAUMA CONSEQUENCES USING SUSTAINED, BIODEGRADABLE NANOPARTICLES. THE STATE OF SUSTAINED-RELEASE TECHNOLOGY WILL BE GREATLY ADVANCED, AND THE REHABILITATION CARE PROVIDED TO TRAUMA PATIENTS WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY. THE TREATMENT TO BE DEVELOPED WILL DECREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPLICATIONS. NEW PHARMACOECONOMIC RESEARCH SHOWS THAT COST/REVENUE OVER THE LONG TERM IS POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY FEWER COMPLICATIONS. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE MAJOR INDUSTRY INITIATIVES UNDERWAY TO CREATE LOCALIZED DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR OPHTHALMIC AND CANCER TREATMENTS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO APPROVED OR IN-DEVELOPMENT TREATMENTS FOR THIS UNMET MEDICAL NEED IN ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY. SUPPORT FROM THE NSF WILL FUNCTION AS A SPARK TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COMMERCIAL EFFECT OF THIS FIRST ORTHOPEDIC NANOMEDICINE PROJECT. THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PHASE II PROJECT WILL ADDRESS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH BY UTILIZING ANTI-INFLAMMATORY NANOPARTICLES EMBEDDED WITH POTENT HEDGEHOG PATHWAY ANTAGONIST-ARSENIC TRIOXIDE (NP102NANO). THIS INNOVATIVE AND DISTINCTIVE APPROACH FOR DEVELOPING A SUSTAINED-RELEASE, BIODEGRADABLE DRUG DELIVERY THAT DELIVERS POST-TRAUMATIC MEDICATION LOCALLY WITHIN THE INJURED TISSUE IS BASED ON THE DESIRE TO OBVIATE UNNECESSARY SYSTEMIC DRUG APPLICATIONS AND CREATE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE OFF-THE-SHELF THERAPY. SUCH A PRODUCT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS WITH POST-TRAUMATIC INJURIES AND REDUCE SOCIETAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL SURGERIES AND REHABILITATION AMONG TRAUMA SURGERY PATIENTS. CURRENT ORTHOPEDIC TREATMENTS UTILIZE SYSTEMIC, UNTARGETED ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICATIONS THAT RESULT IN UNINTENDED SIDE EFFECTS, IMPLANT FAILURE, AND/OR LACK OF INTENDED EFFICACY. MOREOVER, THE LACK OF AN EFFICIENT DELIVERY VEHICLE REQUIRES DRUG APPLICATION AT SUPRAPHYSIOLOGICAL DOSES TO REACH CLINICAL EFFICACY. THE APPLICATION AT SUPRAPHYSIOLOGICAL DOSES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE RISK OF SIDE EFFECTS. IT, THEREFORE, IS DESIRABLE TO PROVIDE FORMULATIONS AND METHODS THAT TARGET THE DELIVERY OF MEDICATIONS ONLY TO THE TISSUES NEEDING TREATMENT. THIS PLATFORM UNDER DEVELOPMENT OFFERS EXACTLY THIS BENEFIT. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT DATA FOR THE PRE-INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG MEETING WITH THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES (SUCH AS FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION).

TO OVERCOME THIS CHALLENGE, DRUG SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING (DST) IS ESSENTIAL FOR IDENTIFYING THE MOST EFFECTIVE DRUGS TO TREAT AND MONITORING DRUG RESISTANCE IN THESE DISEASES. PYRAZINAMIDE (PZA) IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF CURRENT TUBERCULOSIS (TB) TREATMENT, SHORTENING DRUG SUSCEPTIBLE TB (DS-TB) TREATMENT DURATION FROM 9-12 MONTHS TO 6 MONTHS. PZA IS ALSO USED IN MULTIDRUG RESISTANT TB (MDR-TB) TREATMENT. UNFORTUNATELY, PZA RESISTANCE IS INCREASING, WITH A POOLED PREVALENCE OF PZA RESISTANCE AMONG ALL TB CASES ESTIMATED AT 16.2%, LEADING TO WORSE CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING DEATH. UNLIKE OTHER TB DRUGS, CURRENT PZA SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTS ARE UNRELIABLE, COMPLICATED, AND EXPENSIVE, LEADING TO UNDERUTILIZATION, EVEN IN HIGH TB BURDEN AREAS. MISCLASSIFYING PZA-RESISTANT INFECTIONS AS PZA-SUSCEPTIBLE INFECTIONS RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR THE PATIENTS AND DEVELOPMENT OF FURTHER DRUG RESISTANCE. CONVERSELY, CONSIDERING PZA-SUSCEPTIBLE INFECTIONS AS PZA-RESISTANT INFECTION LEADS TO LONGER TREATMENT WITH MORE EXPENSIVE AND TOXIC MEDICINES UNNECESSARILY. THE GLOBAL BURDEN OF PZA-RESISTANT TB IS ESTIMATED AT 1.4 MILLION NEW CASES OUT OF 10.6 MILLION ACTIVE TB CASES PER YEAR, HIGHLIGHTING A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR CURRENT TB CONTROL. ACCORDING TO THE CDC, TREATMENT COSTS FOR DR-TB ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN FOR DS-TB, AT TIMES, COSTING $528,000 (2020 USD) MORE TO TREAT A PATIENT WITH DR-TB THAN TO TREAT A PATIENT WITH DS-TB. DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PZA IN MANY TB REGIMENS, THE EMERGENCE OF PZA RESISTANCE AND SYSTEMATIC PROBLEMS IN CURRENT PZA DST, RELIABLE PZA SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING HAS BEEN ASSIGNED A HIGH PRIORITY IN THE TARGET PRODUCT PROFILE BY THE WHO. TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE, IT IS URGENT TO DEVELOP A RAPID, RELIABLE AND ACCURATE PZA DST THAT CAN BE ROUTINELY PERFORMED IN MYCOBACTERIAL LABS WORLDWIDE. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT TB PATIENTS RECEIVE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND ADEQUATE TREATMENT, PREVENT THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF TB DRUG RESISTANCE AND LIMIT ITS SPREAD. OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP SUCH A TEST, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIATED BY OUR PRELIMINARY FINDINGS INDICATING THAT (1) PZA IS ACTIVE IN LIQUID AND AGAR MEDIA AT PH 6.8, WHICH IS OPTIMAL FOR THE GROWTH OF M. TUBERCULOSIS, UNLIKE THE CURRENT ACIDIC CONDITIONS THAT ARE UNSTABLE WHEN BACTERIA GROW, LEADING TO A HIGH RATE OF FALSE RESISTANCE AND TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES; (2) THE NEW TESTING CAN DETERMINE THE CRITICAL PROPORTION OF PZA-RESISTANT M. TUBERCULOSIS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH TREATMENT OUTCOMES, WITH ONE OF THE IMPORTANT SPECIFICATIONS OF DST AT 1%, COMPARED WITH 10% FOR THE CURRENT TEST; (3) THE NEW PZA SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING CAN BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT THE NEED FOR EXPENSIVE READOUT EQUIPMENT, WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FROM CURRENT TEST SUCH AS THE BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA THAT RELIES COMPLETELY ON SUCH EQUIPMENT; (4) THE TURNAROUND TIME FOR THE NEW TEST IS MUCH SHORTER, WITH RESULTS BEING OBTAINED IN TEN DAYS, COMPARED TO THE BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA THAT TAKES UP TO 21 DAYS. THEREFORE, THE PROPOSED STUDY IS FEASIBLE AND WILL FILL A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN TB DST, BOOSTING THE INTERPRETATION OF RAPID MOLECULAR DRUG RESISTANCE PREDICATION AND DRIVING BASIC RESEARCH IN PZA. THE COMPLETION OF THE STUDY WILL PROVIDE A USEFUL TOOL THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,R,SMALL BUSINESS,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R44AI181252_7529/,2024-10-04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COPD IS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH GLOBALLY, WITH OVER 3 MILLION FATALITIES AND AN ANNUAL COST OF $52 BILLION IN THE U.S. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE JOHNS HOPKINS CLINICAL RESEARCH NETWORK (JHCRN), THIS PROJECT AIMS TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY TO UNDERSERVED PATIENTS IN THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION. ALIGNING WITH THE NIH'S EMPHASIS ON IMPROVING PATIENT ADHERENCE, THE PROJECT CENTERS ON ENHANCING ADHERENCE TO REMOTE MONITORING AND EARLY SYMPTOM RECOGNITION TO REDUCE COPD READMISSIONS AND HEALTHCARE COSTS.  COPD SYMPTOMS INCLUDE DYSPNEA, COUGHING, AND SPUTUM PRODUCTION. THE CURRENT 23% READMISSION RATE POSES A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. EARLY SYMPTOM DETECTION CAN FACILITATE HOME TREATMENT, REDUCING READMISSIONS AND COSTS. STANDARD LUNG FUNCTION ASSESSMENTS REQUIRE MEDICAL EXPERTISE AND ARE NOT SUITED FOR CONTINUOUS, REMOTE MONITORING. EARLY DETECTION OF DETERIORATING LUNG FUNCTION ENABLES TIMELY INTERVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF COPD SEVERITY.  THIS PROJECT EXTENDS OUR INTEL AWARD-WINNING, PATENTED WIRELESS WEARME SYSTEM TO CAPTURE PHYSIOLOGIC BASELINES AND POTENTIAL ACUTE CHANGES IN COPD PATIENTS. WEARME USES A BODY AREA SENSOR NETWORK WITH MULTIMODAL SENSING CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS DIGITAL STETHOSCOPE, BODY KINEMATICS, AND ELECTROCARDIOGRAM. WE WILL EXPLORE OUR SENSING MODALITIES TO CAPTURE BILATERAL BIOMARKERS AND CHANGES IN LUNG FUNCTION, RESPIRATION PERIOD, AND USER ACTIVITY.  IN PHASE I, WE WILL ASSESS LUNG FUNCTION AND USER RESPIRATION IN REAL-TIME DURING ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (ADL), LIKE WALKING AND STAIR CLIMBING, IN AN IN-CLINIC CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. THE GOAL IS TO EVALUATE PATIENTS' PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND ABILITY TO PERFORM ADL FOR THE PHASE II LONGITUDINAL STUDY. IN PHASE II, WE WILL VALIDATE OUR WEARME SYSTEM THROUGH REMOTE MONITORING, USABILITY, AND ADHERENCE STUDIES, ASSOCIATING CHANGES IN BIOMARKERS WITH ADL. TO ENSURE HIGH ADHERENCE RATES, STRATEGIES SUCH AS PUSH NOTIFICATIONS, PATIENT ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS, AND INCENTIVES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. FOR PATIENTS WHO DO NOT OWN A SUITABLE SMARTPHONE, WE ARE PREPARED TO PROVIDE A LOANER DEVICE FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY. THE REVISED PROPOSAL EMPHASIZES THE UNIQUE ADVANTAGES OF THE WEARME-PRO SYSTEM OVER TRADITIONAL HAND-HELD SPIROMETERS. UNLIKE HAND-HELD SPIROMETERS THAT PROVIDE ONLY INTERMITTENT DATA, OUR WEARABLE DEVICE PROVIDES A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF A PATIENT'S RESPIRATORY HEALTH OVER TIME. THE DEVICE ALSO CAPTURES COUGH FREQUENCY, A KNOWN PRECURSOR TO EXACERBATIONS. SUCH CONTINUOUS MONITORING ENABLES HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO TRACK CHANGES IN THE PATIENT'S RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS AND RESPOND PROMPTLY TO POTENTIAL EXACERBATIONS.  WE HAVE INSTITUTED REGULAR MEETINGS, SPECIFIC TASK ASSIGNMENTS, AND CLEAR COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS TO ENSURE EFFICIENT COLLABORATION AMONG THE TEAM MEMBERS. THE RESULTS OF THIS SBIR FAST-TRACK PROJECT WILL SUPPORT FDA SUBMISSION FOR 510(K) CLEARANCE AND COMMERCIALIZATION, LEVERAGING PARTNERSHIPS WITH JOHNS HOPKINS, TIDALHEALTH, AND TOWER HEALTH TO MARKET OUR SOLUTION THROUGH A PRESCRIPTION MODEL. BY ADDRESSING PATIENT ADHERENCE, THIS PROJECT AIMS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT COPD MANAGEMENT AND PROMOTE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. 1",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,R,SMALL BUSINESS,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R44HL172444_7529/,2024-10-04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WIDESPREAD PFAS CONTAMINATION HAS RESULTED FROM THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF FLUORINATED CHEMICALS IN CONSUMER AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS FOR MANY DECADES, SPANNING USES INCLUDING NON-STICK COATED COOKWARE, FIREFIGHTING FOAMS, COSMETICS, ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS MANUFACTURING, AND MANY OTHERS. WHILE THE FAR- REACHING IMPACTS OF PFAS EXPOSURE ARE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION, NOTED ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS INCLUDE CANCER, THYROID DISEASE, PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION, AND PREECLAMPSIA, AMONG OTHERS. THE ANNUAL COST BURDEN OF THESE HEALTH EFFECTS HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AT $62.6B FOR THE U.S. AND €52-84B ($37-59B) IN EUROPE, THOUGH EVEN THESE FIGURES ARE NOTED AS LIKELY UNDERESTIMATES. DESPITE THE SEVERITY OF THIS PROBLEM, NO PROCESS IN STANDARD WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES PFAS CONTAMINATION, ENABLING THE RELEASE OF PFAS- CONTAINING DISCHARGE INTO SURFACE WATERS THAT ARE USED AS DRINKING WATER SOURCES. ACTIVATED CARBON (AC) AND ION EXCHANGE (IX) RESINS SUFFER FROM LOW CAPACITY AND/OR SELECTIVITY, ESPECIALLY AGAINST SHORT-CHAIN PFAS; REVERSE OSMOSIS (RO) SUFFERS FROM HIGH ENERGY DEMANDS AND COSTS DESPITE ONLY A MODERATE (5-10X) PFAS CONCENTRATION FACTOR. FURTHERMORE, TODAY’S PFAS REMOVAL SORBENTS ARE POORLY REGENERABLE, OFTEN DESTINED FOR INCINERATION OR LANDFILL DISPOSAL ONCE THEIR PFAS REMOVAL CAPACITY IS EXHAUSTED; SORBENTS COMPATIBLE WITH THERMAL REACTIVATION (AC) HAVE RELATIVELY LOW CAPACITY AND/OR INCUR HIGH COSTS AND ENERGY-INTENSIVE PROCESSES. ADDRESSING THESE GAPS, SORBENTA HAS DEVELOPED A PATENT-PROTECTED CLASS OF GRANULAR SORBENTS THAT SELECTIVELY REMOVE PFAS FROM COMPLEX WATERS. BY LEVERAGING SYNERGISTIC IONIC AND FLUOROUS INTERACTIONS IN A SINGLE RESIN, THE TECHNOLOGY SPECIFICALLY TARGETS PFAS REMOVAL OVER BACKGROUND CONTAMINANTS. IN THIS PHASE I PROJECT, SORBENTA SEEKS TO ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) ENHANCING IF SORBENT REGENERABILITY WHILE MINIMIZING VOLUME OF PFAS- LADEN WASTE; 2) INVESTIGATING COMPATIBILITY TO TREAT A RANGE OF COMMERCIALLY RELEVANT, PFAS-LADEN INFLUENTS; AND 3) DEVELOPING A SUSPENSION PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING SORBENT BEADS. SUCCESSFUL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THESE AIMS WILL ADVANCE THE TECHNOLOGY TOWARD A MARKETABLE SOLUTION FOR PFAS REMOVAL AND SET THE TEAM UP FOR SUCCESS IN PHASE II, DURING WHICH THE TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SCALED UP AND FURTHER TESTED FOR SELECTIVE REMOVAL OF A BROAD SELECTION OF PFAS COMPOUNDS.

THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAUSATIVE MICROORGANISM UTILIZING PROCESSES BASED ON BLOOD CULTURE IS A KEYSTONE OF SEPSIS DIAGNOSIS. HOWEVER, BLOOD CULTURE TAKES ONE TO FIVE DAYS TO PROVIDE RESULTS. HERE, WE PROPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CULTURE AND AMPLIFICATION-FREE ASSAY TO DETECT AND IDENTIFY BACTERIA IN ONE HOUR DIRECTLY ON WHOLE BLOOD. THE NEW ASSAY WILL ENABLE PHYSICIANS TO PROVIDE THERAPY TARGETING THE CAUSATIVE ORGANISM DAYS EARLIER THAN THE CURRENT STANDARDS. THE NEW ASSAY WILL BE BASED ON SINGLE MOLECULE TETHERING (SMOLT), A NOVEL SAMPLE PREPARATION AND AMPLIFICATION-FREE MOLECULAR DETECTION METHOD DEVELOPED AT SCANOGEN. THE WORK PROPOSED IN THIS APPLICATION WILL BUILD ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF AN ONGOING PROJECT AIMED AT DEVELOPING AN ASSAY TO DETECT FUNGI IN WHOLE BLOOD. THE SMOLT-BACTERIA ASSAY PROPOSED IN THIS APPLICATION WILL IDENTIFY THE SPECIES, GENUS OR ORDER OF THE CAUSATIVE ORGANISM IN APPROXIMATELY 90% OF BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS. THE NEW SYSTEM WILL BE EASY-TO-USE, FULLY AUTOMATED, AND CAPABLE OF RAPID DETECTION IN WHOLE BLOOD WITHOUT BLOOD CULTURE. DESPITE THE URGENT CLINICAL NEED, THERE IS ONLY ONE FDA APPROVED CULTURE-FREE MOLECULAR ASSAY FOR SEPSIS DIAGNOSIS. IN COMPARISON TO THIS TEST, THE SMOLT- BACTERIA ASSAY WILL BE 4 TIMES FASTER, 6 TIMES LESS EXPENSIVE, AND THANKS TO ITS HIGHER MULTIPLEXING CAPABILITY, IT WILL DETECT AND IDENTIFY THE CAUSATIVE PATHOGEN IN TWICE THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS. IN OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS, WE DEVELOPED A MULTIPLEX ASSAY CAPABLE OF DETECTING BACTERIA DIRECTLY IN WHOLE BLOOD. WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ASSAY IS HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND SENSITIVE WITH A LIMIT OF DETECTION (LOD) BETWEEN 1-10 CFU/ML, DEPENDING ON THE SPECIES, WHICH IS AS GOOD AS THE ONLY FDA-APPROVED TEST. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ASSAY PROTOCOL BY INCLUDING NEW PROBES AND OPTIMIZING THE OVERALL ASSAY (AIM 1). WE WILL TEST THE MANUAL PROTOCOL AND DEVELOP A FULLY INTEGRATED DISPOSABLE CARTRIDGE AND INSTRUMENT (AIM 2). FINALLY, WE WILL EVALUATE THE ASSAY IN PILOT ANALYTICAL AND CLINICAL VALIDATION STUDIES (AIM 3). WE WILL WORK WITH A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM THAT INCLUDES EXPERTS IN ASSAY DEVELOPMENT AND INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF ENGINEERING AT BECTON DICKINSON, EXPERTS IN MICROBIOLOGY, SEPSIS DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FROM JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, AS WELL AS ENGINEERS FROM KEY TECHNOLOGIES.

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS ARE AVAILABLE THREE OR MORE DAYS AFTER THE DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS IS STARTED. THE LACK OF RAPID DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS FORCES PHYSICIANS TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS WHICH ARE NOT EFFECTIVE AGAINST A GROWING NUMBER OF RESISTANT ORGANISMS AND CAN INDUCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE.

THE NEW PLATFORM WILL DIRECTLY ANALYZE WHOLE BLOOD SAMPLES USING A SIMPLE AND ROBUST SINGLE MOLECULE DETECTION APPROACH CALLED SINGLE MOLECULE TETHERING OR SMOLT. THE PLATFORM WILL BE RAPID (ID IN ONE HOUR AND AST IN 4- 6 HOURS), EASY-TO-USE, AND COST-EFFECTIVE. OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT A SMOLT MULTIPLEX ASSAY CAN DETECT BACTERIA IN BLOOD WITH LIMITS OF DETECTION (LOD) BETWEEN 1-10 CFU/ML WITH A TURN-AROUND-TIME OF ABOUT AN HOUR. THE SAME TECHNIQUE CAN BE USED FOR AST. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT A BRIEF INCUBATION WITH AN ANTIBIOTIC FOLLOW BY SMOLT DETECTION CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE IF A STRAIN IS SUSCEPTIBLE, INTERMEDIATE OR RESISTANCE IN HIGH AGREEMENT WITH THE CATEGORY ASSIGNED BE A STANDARD REFERENCE METHOD.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE MOLECULAR ASSAY CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING MICROBES DIRECTLY FROM WHOLE BLOOD HAS BEEN ELUSIVE DESPITE MAJOR EFFORTS DUE TO THE LOW CONCENTRATION OF MICROBES IN THE BLOODSTREAM AND THE LARGE NUMBER OF MICROBIAL SPECIES THAT CAUSE BLOODSTREAM INFECTION (200+). WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN AUTOMATED ASSAY THAT DETECTS 13 BLOODSTREAM MICROBES DIRECTLY IN WHOLE BLOOD AT THE LOW CONCENTRATIONS FOUND IN CLINICAL SAMPLES, WITH LODS BETWEEN 0.5 AND 3 CFU/ML AND A TURNAROUND TIME OF 70 MINUTES. THE ASSAY PERFORMANCE IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER FDA CLEARED ASSAYS FOR BLOODSTREAM PATHOGEN DETECTION. THE NEW ASSAY IS BASED ON SINGLE MOLECULE TETHERING (SMOLT), A NOVEL SAMPLE PREPARATION AND AMPLIFICATION-FREE MOLECULAR DETECTION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED AT SCANOGEN. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE MULTIPLEXING CAPACITY OF SMOLT USING A NOVEL APPROACH WITH THE GOAL OF PRODUCING A PANEL THAT COVERS THE ORGANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN 99% OF BLOODSTREAM INFECTION CASES (AIM 1). WE WILL ALSO INTEGRATE THE AUTOMATED ASSAY INTO A SINGLE DISPOSABLE CARTRIDGE THAT WILL BE PROCESSED BY AN EASY-TO-USE AND FULLY AUTOMATED DESKTOP INSTRUMENT (AIM 2).

EACH OF THESE SPECIFIC AIMS HAS QUANTITATIVE MILESTONES. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN FDA-CLEARED AND CLIA-WAIVED SYSTEM; THIS PROJECT IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS THAT GOAL. WE WILL ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF ACHIEVING THE REQUIRED LEVEL MULTIPLEXING AND ASSAY INTEGRATION, WHICH ARE THE MOST SERIOUS RISKS ON THE PATH TO DEVELOPING THE CLINICAL SYSTEM. WE WILL WORK WITH A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM THAT INCLUDES EXPERTS IN ASSAY DEVELOPMENT AND INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF ENGINEERING AT BECTON DICKINSON, EXPERTS IN MICROBIOLOGY, SEPSIS DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FROM JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, AS WELL AS ENGINEERS FROM KEY TECHNOLOGIES.

RECENT ADVANCES IN CHROMATIN BIOLOGY AND HIGH-THROUGHPUT GENETIC SEQUENCING HAVE DISCOVERED THAT SUCH DISRUPTIONS UNDERLIE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF CANCERS. WHILE THE AFFECTED EPIGENETIC PATHWAYS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CANCER PATHOPHYSIOLOGY ARE QUITE DIVERSE, A COMMON THEME AMONG THEM IS THAT ABERRANT REGULATION OF EPIGENETIC ENZYMES CAN LEAD TO DYSREGULATED EXPRESSION OF KEY DISEASE DRIVER GENES. FOR EXAMPLE, ABERRANT DNA METHYLATION, HISTONE H3 METHYLATION AND/OR HISTONE H3 DEACETYLATION CAN REPRESS GENES, AND LEAD TO A MORE DELETERIOUS DISEASE PHENOTYPE. INDEED, BROAD-ACTING PAN-EPIGENETIC INHIBITORS HAVE SHOWN INITIAL PROMISE CLINICALLY BY GROSSLY DISRUPTING DISEASE SIGNALING PATHWAYS BY ALTERING THE EXPRESSION PROFILE OF KEY GENES. HOWEVER, A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE RELATED TO THE MECHANISM OF THESE TRADITIONAL EPIGENETIC INHIBITORS CENTERS ON THEIR POTENTIAL TO AFFECT THOUSANDS OF GENES SIMULTANEOUSLY (BOTH ON- AND OFF-TARGET). THUS, WHILE TREATMENT WITH HISTONE DEACETYLASE (HDAC) INHIBITORS CAUSES THE DESIRED EFFECT OF ACTIVATION OF SPECIFIC TARGET GENES, THIS ACTIVATION ALSO COMES WITH OFF-TARGET ACTIVATION OF POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL GENES. RECENTLY, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS ON THE CRISPR/CAS9 SYSTEM HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ALLOW FOR INDUCTION OF SITE-SPECIFIC CHROMATIN MODIFICATIONS THAT CAN MODULATE GENE EXPRESSION. OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS BUILD ON THESE APPROACHES AND ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING TARGETED, EPIGENETICALLY BASED GENE THERAPEUTICS WITH REAL POTENTIAL FOR CLINICAL TRANSLATION.  HERE, WE OUTLINE AN APPROACH THAT LEVERAGES A SITE-SPECIFIC DCAS9-FKBP FUSION PROTEIN, COUPLED WITH A SYNTHETIC BIFUNCTIONAL CHEMICAL EPIGENETIC MODIFIER (CEM). THE CEM CONSISTS OF THREE MODULAR COMPONENTS: (1) FK506 (WHICH BINDS FKBP); (2) A SHORT INERT CHEMICAL POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL (PEG) LINKER; AND (3) A CHEMICAL ENTITY THAT INTERACTS WITH HOST EPIGENETIC MACHINERY. ULTIMATELY, THE DCAS9-FKBP CEM HAS THE ABILITY TO TARGET ANY LOCUS IN THE GENOME, AND “ACTIVATE” EPIGENETIC ACTIVITY TO MODULATE GENE EXPRESSION. WE PROPOSE TO IMPLEMENT THIS STRATEGY TO A CLINICALLY RELEVANT TARGET: TP53. OUR PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY SEEKS TO TARGET ENDOGENOUS HISTONE ACETYLATION ENZYMES TO THE TP53 LOCUS TO REVERSE ITS EPIGENETIC REPRESSION, AND THUS INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF TUMOR CELLS TO CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS. AS A FIRST STEP, WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE OUR TECHNOLOGY IN PRECLINICAL MODELS OF COLORECTAL CANCER. COLORECTAL CANCER IS THE THIRD MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED CANCER AND THIRD CANCER MOST COMMON CAUSE OF CANCER-RELATED DEATH AMONG BOTH MEN AND WOMEN. ADDITIONALLY, COLORECTAL CANCER IS KNOWN TO BE DRIVEN BY BOTH MUTATED AND EPIGENETICALLY SILENCED TP53, AND THERE ARE AVAILABLE PRECLINICAL MODEL SYSTEMS THAT RECAPITULATE WAS IS OBSERVED CLINICALLY.

THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT AAV EPISOMES MAY BE RESTRICTED FOR MAXIMAL EXPRESSION AND ALLUDE TO THE ABILITY FOR TARGETED APPROACHES FOR MODULATING THEIR EPIGENETIC COMPOSITION TO ENHANCE AND/OR REPRESS AAV VECTOR TRANSDUCTION. WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED A TECHNOLOGY THAT COUPLES A DCAS9-BASED PROTEIN TARGETING SYSTEM AT A PROMOTER WITH A SMALL BIFUNCTIONAL MOLECULE TO CONTROL GENE EXPRESSION.

THE PROPOSED VEHICLE FLEET PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO ENABLE EFFICIENT DEORBIT SERVICES FOR REMOVAL FROM SPACE. THIS STTR PHASE I PROJECT PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE METHOD FOR EARTH ORBIT TRANSFER, CALLED A HYPER TRANSFER VEHICLE (HTV). HTV IS A NON-ROCKET TECHNOLOGY THAT SOLVES PERFORMANCE LIMITATIONS OF IN-SPACE ROCKET THRUSTERS. HTV OFFERS REUSABLE AND ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE ORBITAL SPACE DEBRIS REMOVAL SOLUTIONS ACROSS ALL EARTH OPERATIONAL ORBITS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE SPACE DEBRIS PROBLEM NOT CAUSED BY OPERATIONAL SATELLITES, BUT FROM NON-MANEUVERABLE OBJECTS AND DEBRIS IN THE HIGHLY POPULATED SUN SYNCHRONOUS ORBITS (SSO).

THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF HTV RESEARCH IS A VIABLE AND REUSABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR COST-EFFECTIVE ORBIT OBJECT DISPOSAL IN HIGH VALUE SSO WITH CLEAN SOLAR ELECTRIC PROPULSION (SEP). INSTEAD OF EXPELLING PROPELLANT, HTV ROTATES A WORKING FLUID GAS INSIDE A TOROIDAL CAVITY TO GENERATE A USABLE FORCE. HTV TORUS STRUCTURE DRAWS IN THE GAS WHILE MOUNTED INSIDE AN AMBIENT PRESSURE ENCLOSURE, WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM THE VACUUM OF SPACE. HTV GENERATES A REACTIVE FORCE BY EMPLOYING THE CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM (CAM). CAM IS PRESERVED WHEN HTV FLUID ANGULAR MOMENTUM (H) AND ROTATIONAL ENERGY (TROT) CHANGE.

HEAD MALFORMATIONS DURING INFANCY CAN BE SYNOSTOTIC (I.E., CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS) OR NONSYNOSTOTIC (SUCH AS DEFORMATIONAL PLAGIOCEPHALY AND BRACHYCEPHALY OR DPB). BOTH TYPES OF CONDITIONS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND BENEFIT FROM EARLY TREATMENT TO AVOID LONG-TERM HEALTH COMPLICATIONS. THE PREVALENCE OF DPB INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS, FROM 5% TO APPROXIMATELY 20%-30%, CAUSING THE CONDITION TO BE CALLED A PEDIATRIC EPIDEMIC. CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS IS LESS COMMON AFFECTING 1 IN 2,000 CHILDREN. TO IMPROVE THE EARLY MANAGEMENT OF THESE CONDITIONS AND TO PREVENT MORE COMPLEX TREATMENT AND ASSOCIATED MORBIDITIES, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO MONITOR THE GROWTH OF THE INFANT HEAD AT THE POINT-OF-CARE.  TO ADDRESS THIS UNMET CLINICAL NEED, WE WILL DEVELOP AND EVALUATE A MOBILE DIGITAL TOOL THAT WILL ENABLE PEDIATRICIANS TO CAPTURE AND ANALYZE 3D SCANS OF EVERY INFANT FOR THE EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF CRANIAL MALFORMATIONS. IN THE PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT, WE WILL DEVELOP A NOVEL TECHNOLOGY TO RAPIDLY CAPTURE AND ANALYZE 3D DATA OF THE TOP OF CRANIUM IN JUST SECONDS. WE WILL USE MACHINE LEARNING METHODS TO AUTOMATICALLY COMPUTE THE HEAD SHAPE PARAMETERS, INCLUDING THE HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE WHICH IS ROUTINELY PERFORMED DURING EVERY CHILD VISIT, BUT CURRENTLY WITH AN OUTDATED AND UNRELIABLE MEASURING TAPE. OUR TECHNOLOGY WILL BE DESIGNED FOR THE GENERAL CRANIAL EVALUATION OF ALL INFANTS DURING WELL-CHILD VISITS. IN PHASE II, WE WILL DEVELOP METHODS FOR THE 3D RECONSTRUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE FULL CRANIUM FROM A SMARTPHONE. WE WILL ALSO TRAIN DEEP LEARNING MODELS TO CLASSIFY TYPES OF CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS AND OTHER CRANIAL CONDITIONS AND CONDUCT CLINICAL EVALUATION AND USER-FEASIBILITY STUDIES.  THE OVERALL MISSION OF PEDIAMETRIX IS TO PROVIDE ACCURATE DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS FOR PEDIATRIC HEALTH AT THE POINT-OF-CARE. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING AND QUANTITATIVE IMAGING ALGORITHMS THAT IN COMBINATION WITH SMARTPHONE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES WILL BE PACKAGED AS MOBILE DIGITAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS ACCESSIBLE TO PEDIATRIC HEALTH PROVIDERS AT ANY TIME AND LOCATION. SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF SOFTSPOT3DTM WILL LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN LEFT WITH UNTREATED CRANIAL CONDITIONS IN ADDITION TO LOWERING THE ASSOCIATED HEALTHCARE COSTS AND SOCIAL ANXIETY.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,R,SMALL BUSINESS,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R44DE031461_7529/,2024-10-04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING A LIGHTWEIGHT, EASY-TO-INSTALL, NON-COMBUSTIBLE INSULATION PRODUCT WHICH IS ALSO ECO-FRIENDLY AND NON-TOXIC. STRUCTURE FIRES REPRESENT 37% OF ALL FIRES IN THE US. THESE FIRES CAUSED $12.3 BILLION IN PROPERTY DAMAGE AND 80% OF CIVILIAN FIRE DEATHS. WILDFIRES IN THE WESTERN US, WHERE >$220 BILLION IN RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION IS IN ?EXTREME? WILDFIRE-PRONE AREAS, ADD TO THE URGENCY OF THIS SITUATION. MINERAL WOOL IS THE ONLY NON-COMBUSTIBLE INSULATION PRODUCT AVAILABLE TODAY BUT REQUIRES PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR INSTALLATION AND WAS RECENTLY CLASSIFIED AS CARCINOGENIC.

SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PRODUCT WILL FIND MANY OTHER INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING HEALTHCARE APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS SIMULATING BLOOD FLOW IN ORGANS OR AIRFLOW IN THE LUNGS. THE PRODUCT WILL HELP COMPANIES TO REDUCE THE COST AND TIME IN DEVELOPING SUPERIOR TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS SAFER AIRCRAFT THAT CONSUME LESS FUEL, ENERGY PLANTS THAT EMIT LESS CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), AND DEVICES THAT DELIVER DRUGS MORE EFFECTIVELY. THE PROJECT INCLUDES A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCHERS. BY INVOLVING STUDENT INTERNS AND EXPOSING THEM TO THE EMERGING FIELD OF QUANTUM COMPUTING, THIS PROJECT AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATH (STEM) WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. ULTIMATELY, THIS PROJECT AIMS TO CREATE A NEW GENERATION OF CFD TECHNOLOGY BASED ON QUANTUM COMPUTING, ADVANCING THE CFD FIELD, AND AIDING U.S. LEADERSHIP IN QUANTUM COMPUTING.

CFD IS A VALUABLE TOOL FOR ENGINEERS TO PREDICT FLUID FLOW AND DESIGN OR TROUBLESHOOT VARIOUS SYSTEMS SUCH AS AIRPLANES, AUTOMOBILES, AND CHEMICAL REACTORS. HOWEVER, SOME CFD SIMULATIONS ARE TOO EXPENSIVE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO RUN, EVEN THOUGH SUCH KNOWLEDGE COULD SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CERTIFYING EACH NEW AIRCRAFT TYPE. HIGH RESOLUTION SLOWS CFD SIMULATIONS BECAUSE LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA MUST BE STORED IN, READ FROM, AND WRITTEN TO THE COMPUTER MEMORY. THIS LIMITATION CAN BE OVERCOME BY UTILIZING THE VAST QUANTUM STATE SPACES THAT HAVE BECOME AVAILABLE WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF QUANTUM COMPUTERS. AN ALGORITHM WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN A SOFTWARE PROTOTYPE AND THE FLOW BETWEEN FIXED AND MOVING PLATES WILL BE SIMULATED ON QUANTUM COMPUTERS.

THERE IS CURRENTLY NEITHER AN EFFECTIVE VACCINE NOR EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR HUNOV INFECTIONS. COMPOUNDING THE PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT HUNOV STRAINS MUTATE RAPIDLY AND UNPREDICTABLY, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE IMPACT OF ANY TARGETED THERAPEUTIC WHEN FACED WITH NOVEL EMERGING STRAINS. THIS PROPOSAL’S LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE IS TO EVALUATE A NOVEL APPROACH TO THE PREVENTION OR TREATMENT OF HUNOV DIARRHEA: USING ANTI-HUNOV ANTIBODIES, PURIFIED FROM EGGS OF HENS IMMUNIZED WITH NANOPARTICLES REPRESENTING MULTIPLE STRAINS OF HUNOV, TO PROVIDE “PASSIVE IMMUNITY” TO THE INTESTINAL TRACT. THESE ANTIBODIES ARE CALLED “IGY” TO INDICATE THAT THEY ARE IMMUNOGLOBULINS FROM EGG YOLKS. THE APPLICANT HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THAT ANTI-HUNOV IGY CAN STOP HUNOV VIRUSES FROM REPLICATING IN A HUMAN INTESTINAL CELL MODEL, AND THIS PROJECT IS THE NATURAL EXTENSION OF THAT WORK. THE PROJECT’S SPECIFIC AIM 1 IS TO PRODUCE AND THOROUGHLY CHARACTERIZE IGY PRODUCED AGAINST THREE DIFFERENT STRAINS OF THE PREDOMINANT HUNOV VIRAL GENOTYPE, GII.4. BY USING SO-CALLED “P24” NANOPARTICLES REPRESENTING ALL THREE STRAINS AS THE IMMUNIZING ANTIGENS, THE IGY PRODUCED WILL TARGET ALL THREE VARIANTS, OFFERING A PROOF THAT BROAD-SPECTRUM PROTECTION CAN BE ACHIEVED USING INEXPENSIVE AND READILY-PRODUCED ANTIGENS. ONCE THE ANTIBODIES HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED AND THEIR ABILITY TO BIND TO AND INHIBIT ALL THREE VIRAL STRAINS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE PROJECT’S SPECIFIC AIM 2 WILL BE TO EVALUATE THE PROTECTIVE EFFECT OF THE ANTI-HUNOV ANTIBODIES IN A GNOTOBIOTIC PIG MODEL THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO RECAPITULATE HUMAN HUNOV DIARRHEA. PIGS WILL BE PRE-TREATED FOR ONE DAY WITH THE ACTIVE ANTIBODIES OR CONTROL (UNIMMUNIZED) ANTIBODIES, AND THEN WILL BE INFECTED WITH A LARGE DOSE OF ONE HUNOV GII.4 VARIANT. THE ANIMALS’ SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF DIARRHEA WILL BE MONITORED FOR AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN DAYS, TO HELP US UNDERSTAND BOTH HOW WELL THE TREATMENT PREVENTED DIARRHEA, AND IN THOSE ANIMALS THAT DEVELOP DIARRHEA, HOW WELL IT MINIMIZES THE DISEASE SEVERITY OR DURATION. IF THE PROJECT SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATES SIGNIFICANT PROTECTION AGAINST HUNOV IN THIS MODEL, HUMAN SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, AND EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES WILL BE PERFORMED, ULTIMATELY RESULTING IN REGULATORY APPROVAL TO USE ANTI-HUNOV IGY TO PREVENT AND/OR TREAT HUNOV DIARRHEA. SUCH A READILY AVAILABLE TREATMENT IS EXPECTED TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE HUMAN SUFFERING AND PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL SOCIETAL BENEFIT, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THE US AND AROUND THE WORLD.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,R,SMALL BUSINESS,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R41AI172485_7529/,2023-12-18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ALTHOUGH PAIN IS THE MOST COMMON DRIVER OF HEALTHCARE VISITS FOR IBS PATIENTS, THE CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS ARE OFTEN INEFFECTIVE AND ASSOCIATED WITH SIDE EFFECTS. THE USE OF POTENT OPIOIDS FOR VISCERAL PAIN HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY THAN OTHER PAIN CONDITIONS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. ALTHOUGH THE ETIOLOGY OF IBS IS NOT CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD, THE CURRENT STUDIES INDICATE THAT NEUROINFLAMMATION IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF VISCERAL PAIN. GUT INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS MODULATE THE INTESTINAL NERVE SYSTEM, LEADING TO LONG-LASTING FUNCTIONAL ALTERATIONS AFTER RESOLUTION OF THE INFLAMMATORY INSULT. AMONG INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS, TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA (TNF-Α) IS A “MASTER REGULATOR” AND FOUND TO BE IMPLICATED IN BOTH PERIPHERAL AND CENTRAL SENSITIZATION DURING PAIN INDUCTION IN PRECLINICAL PAIN MODELS AND SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED IN SOME IBS PATIENTS ESPECIALLY PATIENTS WITH POST-INFECTION/INFLAMMATION IBS. THIS PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THERAPEUTICS TARGETING GUT TNF-Α FOR THE TREATMENT OF IBS PAIN. FZATA HAS DEVELOPED A NOVEL ORAL BIOTHERAPEUTIC, FZ006, AN ENGINEERED PROBIOTIC YEAST SACCHAROMYCES BOULARDII THAT SECRETES A NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY AGAINST TNF-Α. WE DEMONSTRATED THAT ORAL FZ006 DELIVERS ANTI- TNF TO GUT AND EXHIBITED EXCEPTIONAL EFFICACY ON RELIEVING VISCERAL PAIN IN SEVERAL ANIMAL MODELS. TO DEVELOP FZ006 AS A SAFE, NON-ADDICTIVE, FIRST-IN-CLASS, ORAL THERAPEUTIC TO TREAT CHRONIC VISCERAL PAIN, WE PROPOSE THE UG3/UH3 PLAN WITH THE FINAL AIM OF AN IND SUBMISSION REQUESTING CLEARANCE FOR PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS. SPECIFICALLY, IN THE UG3 PHASE, WE WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVE DOSE RANGE OF FZ006 AND VALIDATE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY IN HUMANIZED MICE; PERFORM SMALL-SCALE MANUFACTURING AND GENERATE A WELL-CHARACTERIZED RESEARCH CELL BANK; AND PREPARE AND SUBMIT PRE-IND MEETING REQUEST WITH THE FDA. IN THE UH3 PHASE, WE WILL MANUFACTURE FZ006 UNDER GMP TO GENERATE DRUG SUBSTANCE AND DRUG PRODUCT FOR CLINICAL TRIALS; PERFORM STABILITY ASSESSMENT AND GLP TOXICOLOGY STUDIES; PLAN FOR FIRST-IN-HUMAN TRIAL; AND FINALLY SUBMIT IND APPLICATION TO THE FDA FOR APPROVAL.

IT IS WIDELY HELD THAT QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION WILL BE CRITICAL TO REALIZE THE POTENTIAL OF UNIVERSAL QUANTUM COMPUTING. AN ERROR-CORRECTED QUANTUM COMPUTER HOLDS PROMISE FOR MAKING TRANSFORMATIONAL DISCOVERIES IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING THAT WILL HAVE BROAD IMPACT ACROSS TRADITIONAL TECHNOLOGY SECTORS. BY DEVELOPING RESOURCE-EFFICIENT QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION DESIGN AND DECODING SOFTWARE TOOLS, THIS PHASE I PROJECT AIMS TO HASTEN THE ERA OF ERROR-CORRECTED QUANTUM COMPUTING. THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PHASE I PROJECT WILL ADVANCE A NEW METHOD FOR ERROR SYNDROME EXTRACTION FROM A REGISTER OF DATA QUBITS DURING THE EXECUTION OF AN ERROR-CORRECTED QUANTUM ALGORITHM. IN CONTRAST TO THE STANDARD APPROACH TO SYNDROME EXTRACTION, WHERE EACH QUANTUM CODEWORD IS TREATED INDEPENDENTLY, THIS NEW APPROACH EXTRACTS ERROR INFORMATION FROM THE ENTIRE QUANTUM COMPUTER COLLECTIVELY. THE ALGORITHMIC AND COST ADVANTAGE OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF EXTRA QUBITS REQUIRED FOR ERROR SYNDROME EXTRACTION. THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON REDUCING THE DENSITY OF THE QUANTUM CIRCUITS USED FOR SYNDROME EXTRACTION ACCORDING TO THE NEW APPROACH. LOW-DENSITY QUANTUM CIRCUITS ARE CRITICAL FOR ROBUST QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION SINCE SYNDROME EXTRACTION IS MEDIATED BY TWO-QUBIT ENTANGLING GATES, WHICH OFTEN HAVE ERROR RATES HIGHER THAN IDLING OR MEMORY ERRORS OCCURRING IN THE DATA QUBITS. ANOTHER OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I PROJECT IS TO DESIGN LOW-DENSITY ERROR CORRECTING CODES THAT PROMOTE LOCALITY IN SYNDROME EXTRACTION. LOCAL SYNDROME EXTRACTION IS IMPORTANT FOR ERROR CORRECTION IN QUANTUM PROCESSORS THAT SUPPORT LIMITED CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN QUBITS.

IN MAY 2020, NIMH RELEASED ITS NEW STRATEGIC PLAN FOR RESEARCH.  THE NEW STRATEGIC PLAN BUILDS ON THE SUCCESSES OF PREVIOUS NIMH STRATEGIC PLANS BY PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION, AND ADDRESSING NEW CHALLENGES IN MENTAL HEALTH. THE NEW STRATEGIC PLAN OUTLINES FOUR HIGH-LEVEL GOALS:  GOAL 1: DEFINE THE BRAIN MECHANISMS UNDERLYING COMPLEX BEHAVIORS  GOAL 2: EXAMINE MENTAL ILLNESS TRAJECTORIES ACROSS THE LIFESPAN  GOAL 3: STRIVE FOR PREVENTION AND CURES  GOAL 4: STRENGTHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF NIMH-SUPPORTED RESEARCH THESE FOUR GOALS FORM A BROAD ROADMAP FOR THE INSTITUTE'S RESEARCH PRIORITIES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, BEGINNING WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE OF THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR, AND EXTENDING THROUGH EVIDENCE-BASED SERVICES THAT IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE INSTITUTE'S OVERALL FUNDING STRATEGY IS TO SUPPORT A BROAD SPECTRUM OF INVESTIGATOR-INITIATED RESEARCH IN FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE, WITH INCREASING USE OF INSTITUTE-SOLICITED INITIATIVES FOR APPLIED RESEARCH WHERE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT IS A SHORT-TERM MEASURE OF SUCCESS. THE NEW STRATEGIC PLAN ALSO ADDRESSES A NUMBER OF CROSS-CUTTING THEMES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO ALL RESEARCH SUPPORTED BY NIMH, THESE THEMES HIGHLIGHT AREAS WHERE NIMH-FUNDED SCIENCE MAY HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT, BRIDGE GAPS, AND OFFER NOVEL APPROACHES TO ACCELERATE ADVANCES IN MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH. FOR EXAMPLE, NIMH VALUES A COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH AGENDA THAT TAKES AN INCLUSIVE APPROACH THAT ENSURES RESEARCH INTERESTS ARE VARIED, MAINTAIN DIVERSE PARTICIPATION AND PARTNERSHIPS, AND ACHIEVE RESEARCH GOALS ACROSS MULTIPLE TIMEFRAMES. THIS INCLUDES DIVERSE METHODOLOGIES, TOOLS, AND MODELS, RESEARCH ADDRESSING COMPLEX BASIC, TRANSLATIONAL, AND APPLIED QUESTIONS, RESEARCH INCLUDING BOTH SEXES AND, AS APPROPRIATE, GENETIC BACKGROUND, AND, PARTICIPANTS FROM DIVERSE RACIAL AND ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS, AND ACROSS GENDER IDENTITIES, GEOGRAPHICAL CONTEXT, SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, NEUROTYPE, AND AGE  OFFERING THE BEST POSSIBLE REPRESENTATION, FOR THE BROADEST NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY ULTIMATELY BENEFIT FROM THESE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES. TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE NEW STRATEGIC PLAN, NIMH WILL SUPPORT RESEARCH THAT AIMS: TO CHARACTERIZE THE GENOMIC, MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, AND CIRCUIT COMPONENTS CONTRIBUTING TO BRAIN ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTION, TO IDENTIFY THE DEVELOPMENTAL, FUNCTIONAL, AND REGULATORY MECHANISMS RELEVANT TO COGNITIVE, AFFECTIVE, AND SOCIAL DOMAINS, ACROSS UNITS OF ANALYSIS, AND, TO GENERATE AND VALIDATE NOVEL TOOLS, TECHNIQUES, AND MEASURES TO QUANTIFY CHANGES IN THE ACTIVITY OF MOLECULES, CELLS, CIRCUITS, AND CONNECTOMES.

THE ABILITY TO MAP THE 3D ORGANIZATION OF THESE PROTEINS IS KEY FOR COMPREHENDING THE MOLECULAR ANATOMY AND MECHANISMS UNDERLYING BRAIN FUNCTIONS AND DISEASES. CONVENTIONAL OPTICAL MICROSCOPY, LIMITED BY A RESOLUTION OF ~250 NM, FALLS SHORT OF RESOLVING THE COMPLEX SPATIAL ORGANIZATION OF SYNAPTIC PROTEINS. MEANWHILE, ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (EM) AND VARIOUS SUPER- RESOLUTION OPTICAL IMAGING TECHNIQUES LIKE STED AND SMLM ARE HINDERED BY A LACK OF MOLECULAR SPECIFICITY, CHALLENGES IN 3D IMAGING, AND THE LABOR-INTENSIVE, SLOW, AND COSTLY NATURE OF THE OPERATION. THIS GAP IN TECHNOLOGY HAS LEFT SYNAPSE TYPING UNADDRESSED UNTIL THE RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT-GENERATION EXPANSION MICROSCOPY TECHNIQUE, MAGNIFY. MAGNIFY OFFERS AN ~11-FOLD LINEAR EXPANSION OF BIOLOGICAL SPECIMENS IN A SINGLE ROUND, ENSURING EFFICIENT RETENTION OF PROTEINS, NUCLEIC ACIDS, AND LIPIDS. IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH VARIOUS TISSUE TYPES AND FIXATION METHODS WHILE PRESERVING EPITOPES FOR HIGH-PLEX IMAGING. BY REACHING ~15 NM RESOLUTION, MAGNIFY CAN DISCERN ULTRASTRUCTURAL DETAILS SUCH AS CILIA, MITOCHONDRIA CRISTAE, AND SYNAPTIC DENSITIES. WE SEEK TO BUILD THE PROTOTYPE OF THE MULTIPLEX MAGNIFY SAMPLE PREPARATION KITS AS A UNIVERSAL TOOL FOR SYNAPSE TYPING AND BRAIN IMAGING. OUR GOAL IS TO EQUIP NEUROSCIENTISTS WITH THE ABILITY TO PERFORM EM-QUALITY 3D ULTRASTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS, MAPPING AN EXTENSIVE ARRAY OF BIOMOLECULAR MARKERS WITHIN THE INTRICATE SYNAPTIC STRUCTURES IN BRAIN TISSUE AT A FRACTION OF THE COST AND TIME USING ONLY A LIGHT MICROSCOPE. IN OUR PROJECT, WE WILL ENHANCE THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR MAGNIFY TECHNOLOGY IN NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH THROUGH THE FOLLOWING AIMS: (1) VALIDATE MAGNIFY-COMPATIBLE ANTIBODIES AND A NOVEL DIRECT IMMUNOSTAINING STRATEGY FOR KEY SYNAPTIC MARKERS TO GENERATE A LIBRARY OF LABELS FOR NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCHERS; (2) DEVELOP A MOUNTING STRATEGY FOR MULTIPLEX IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE IMAGING OF SYNAPSES TO ENSURE HIGH-FIDELITY IMAGES THROUGH AT LEAST 10 ROUNDS OF IMAGING; AND (3) DEVELOP A MULTIPLEX MAGNIFY KIT PROTOTYPE FOR EASY ADOPTION FOR NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH. UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION, MAGNIFY BIOSCIENCES WILL PRODUCE MULTIPLEX MAGNIFY SAMPLE PREPARATION KITS FOR NEUROSCIENTISTS CONDUCTING SIMULTANEOUS 3D ULTRASTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS, NEURONAL TRACING, SYNAPSE TYPING, ETC., IN BRAIN TISSUE.

CURRENTLY  MOST SUBMILLIMETER-WAVE ARRAY SYSTEMS UTILIZE A SINGLE PIXEL BOTH FOR SPACE AS WELL AS GROUND APPLICATIONS. WHILE THESE APPROACHES ARE WORKABLE FOR THE NEAR-TERM  THEY WILL BECOME UNSUSTAINABLE AS PIXEL COUNT IS INCREASED. IN ADDITION  THE SHEAR MASS ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE COUNT HETERODYNE ARRAYS BASED ON SINGLE WAVEGUIDE BLOCK PER CHIP APPROACHES CAN BE A CHALLENGING TASK. IN THIS PROJECT  WE PRESENT A 3D WAFER LEVEL INTEGRATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY USING LOW COST ALIGNED DIRECT WAFER BONDING AT LOW TEMPERATURE OF 2000C. THIS WAFER LEVEL INTEGRATION MAY DECREASE 50-100X IN BOTH VOLUME AND MASS  HENCE REDUCES THERMAL GRADIENT. AS OF TODAY  MOST OF THE GAIN FLUCTUATIONS IN THIS DEVICE ARE COMING FROM THERMAL GRADIENTS. BY REDUCING THE SIZE AND MASS OF THE RADIOMETER  THE THERMAL GRADIENTS  THESE DEVICES WILL BE ABLE TO BE USED IN BALLOONS  LANDERS  OVERS  AND ANY OTHER PLACE WHERE A COMPLETE REMOTE CHEMICAL LABORATORY MIGHT BE REQUIRED.,NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,R,SMALL BUSINESS,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_80NSSC18K1540_8000/,2020-05-20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
