One of the key traits of a patient's breast tissue that is often neglected in reconstruction is the nipple areolar complex (NAC). There is no clinically viable solution for NAC reconstruction or regeneration. The long-term goal of this work is to develop a personalized, bioresorbable NAC that will provide patients with the shape of a native nipple projection. To pursue this goal, we have developed a hybrid biomaterial implant system consisting of two complementary polymers that (1) define the architecture of the NAC and (2) encourages tissue ingrowth into the NAC. The NAC implant will eventually degrade, leaving in its place a reconstructed NAC that is similar to the original tissue in size, shape, and texture. To this end, we suggest three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will bioprint a viable and translatable NAC. We will generate a portfolio of NAC implant designs via Solidworks, allowing for rapid development of personalized implants. CAD designs will explore the impact of nipple projection height, nipple diameter, areola diameter, and NAC infill patterning upon the implant's properties, and particularly on the retention of shape over time. NAC implants will be fabricated from rapidly translatable biomaterials. Physical and biological properties {shape, mechanics, cell seeding efficiency, cell viability/ proliferation, matrix production) will be assessed, and individual implant component properties and degradation will be evaluated. Specific Aim 2 will establish an in vitro culture system for a bioprinted NAC. We have developed a 3D printed bioreactor specifically for the culture of a bioprinted NAC, as the construct presents unique culture challenges due to its tissue biology (air-water interface) and tissue architecture (non-planar projection shape). NAC bioreactors will be fabricated and employed to culture the bioprinted constructs. Culture conditions, including media flow rate, will be optimized to support cell proliferation and function (ECM production), while maintaining shape of the NAC system. Finally, Aim 3 will vascularize a bioprinted NAC. We suggest that the successful strategy for a clinically translatable bioprinted implant will utilize vascular ingrowth from the surrounding host tissue and into the NAC. To this end, we will design and fabricate a hierarchical NAC vasculature network consisting of a printed microvasculature and a self-assembled microvasculature directed by host tissue. Furthering our established animal model, we will optimize the NAC's vasculature features (architecture, cellularity) to deliver the critical outcomes of rapid establishment, sufficient nutrient delivery, and vascular functionality- while maintaining the NAC's structure and function. The result of the proposed work will be the ability to produce a personalized nipple areolar complex that can be implanted during mound reconstruction or at a later date.",93.865: CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH,sub-grant,9AB0C17D4EEDFDA09263FF2D2904A665,2024,5,Z0638201,40900.0,2024-05-16,2024,HZ5UWCKDVJJ3,,MATERIC LLC,USA,UNITED STATES,1300 BAYARD ST,BALTIMORE,MD,MARYLAND,212301901,MD-03,MD-07,"FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION,LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY",BALTIMORE,MD,MARYLAND,212301901,MD-03,MD-07,USA,UNITED STATES,FFATA-3D BIOPRINTED NIPPLE-AREOLAR COMPLEX IMPLANTS,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01HD112031_7529/,2024-05-23 11:51:38+00,Q: Not Designated Nonemergency/Emergency/Disaster/Wildfire Suppression,752113.54,75.0,Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),7529.0,National Institutes of Health,75NT00,NIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development,075-2023/2023-0844-000;075-2024/2024-0844-000,075-0844,"41.0: Grants, subsidies, and contributions",0008: NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT (0844),OFFICE OF RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION & ADVANCEMENT,,Public/State Controlled Institution of Higher Education,,

Aligned nanofiber materials are desirable for a wide spectrum of applications due to their ability to provide directional control over electrical and thermal conductivity and creation of precisely-patterned surfaces for targeted optical and surface properties. These materials can serve as essential building blocks for high-strength nanofiber composites and textiles. Despite the remarkable promise of aligned nanofibers, there is an absence of commercial-scale roll-to-roll aligned polymer nanofiber manufacturing due to diverse technical hurdles. This project connects an academic research team and an established nanofiber manufacturing company to translate technologies that will overcome these hurdles. Beyond its commercial impacts, this project will lead to the development of a new hands-on educational program and provide students with valuable experience and training opportunities in entrepreneurship, technology translation, and innovation. The proposed project aims to enhance the efficiency, throughput, and consistency of parallel track roll-to-roll electrospinning for aligned nanofiber manufacturing. It is hypothesized that computational electrical field models can predict production efficiency. Computational electrical field models will be generated based on manufacturing process parameters. The production efficiency will be measured as the mass of aligned nanofiber output on a roll, divided by the mass of polymer feed into the system. A convolutional neural network (CNN) machine learning model will also be utilized to correlate electrical field model images with experimentally measured production efficiency. Computational electrical field models can be generated for hundreds of different parameter combinations at the same time instead of testing only a few parameter combinations experimentally. Therefore, this approach allows for efficient in silico screening of the extensive parameter space associated with this complex manufacturing process to maximize the device efficiency. Optimized devices will be scaled, prototyped, and evaluated, demonstrating the capability of parallel track roll-to-roll aligned nanofiber electrospinning manufacture in a commercial context.

Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project relates to the improvement of patient safety and hospital efficiency through the advent of utilization-driven equipment management techniques, specifically for infusion pumps. Infusion pumps serve a vital role in administering treatment to hospitalized patients, but are prone to damage through regular use, resulting in medication errors that harm patients and generate substantial excess healthcare costs. Presently, infusion pumps are serviced according to predetermined time intervals that do not account for variations in device usage, allowing potentially hazardous devices to remain in use between inspections and wasting resources on excessive maintenance of functional devices. Through a multidisciplinary collaboration between university, industry, and healthcare partners, this project will develop a system that makes utilization-driven equipment management practicable in hospitals. The proposed system will facilitate early detection of damaged infusion pumps, thereby reducing the likelihood of costly medication errors and saving thousands of patients from harm each year. In addition to increasing patient safety, the system will address the growing demand among healthcare technology managers for data-driven maintenance and procurement strategies that reduce equipment-related costs and increase the value of care. The proposed project seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in healthcare technology management by developing and advancing towards commercialization a system that leverages newly available sources of infusion pump utilization data, in conjunction with advanced survival analysis and reliability engineering techniques, to formulate optimized utilization-driven equipment management programs accounting for device risk and hospital resource constraints. Technical challenges that will be addressed include (i) knowledge gaps related to the precise nature, variability, and decision implications of the relationship existing between infusion pump utilization and reliability, and (ii) technical barriers pertaining to the implementation of scalable data analysis and construction of a proof-of-concept software tool that will enable end users to formulate optimal infusion pump management programs tailored to their organizational needs. This translational research will result in the creation of data-driven adaptive knowledge specific to healthcare technology management and generalizable to the broader reliability engineering and operations research disciplines. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.","47.084: NSF TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATION, AND PARTNERSHIPS",sub-grant,CE7A7C02737A455DE13F18F8BFF22CB3,2023,10,23-S13R,116000.0,2023-10-02,2024,KW2NMJ1EGY69,,"OPAL HTM, INC.",USA,UNITED STATES,3827 FAWN LN,WHITE PLAINS,MD,MARYLAND,206953310,MD-05,MD-05,FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION,WHITE PLAINS,MD,MARYLAND,206953310,MD-05,MD-05,USA,UNITED STATES,PFI-RP:PARTNERSHIPS FOR PATIENT SAFETY: UTILIZATION-DRIVEN MANAGEMENT OF CRITICAL MEDICAL EQUIPMENT,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_2234544_4900/,2023-11-13 17:02:32+00,Q: Not Designated Nonemergency/Emergency/Disaster/Wildfire Suppression,103114.15,49.0,National Science Foundation (NSF),4900.0,National Science Foundation,491503,TRANSLATIONAL IMPACTS,049-2023/2024-0100-000,049-0100,"41.0: Grants, subsidies, and contributions","0011: TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATION, AND PARTNERSHIPS",,,Private Institution of Higher Education,,

MYANMAR IS ONE OF THE MOST FORESTED COUNTRIES IN ASIA. IN THE PAST  THE COUNTRY HAD RETAINED HIGH LEVELS OF BIODIVERSITY AND FOREST COVER  PARTLY DUE TO ITS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISOLATION.
