    "This script searches the SBIR/STTR database for companies of interest using their UEI (Unique Entity Identification) number. If you need to search for multiple company UEIs, please refer to the script labeled ueiSearch.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a company is found in the database, two CSV files will be generated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `company_info_sbirsttr_db.csv`: This file contains information from the company profile, including address, number of employees, website, and more. Additional data points from each company profile can be pulled, so feel free to customize the script according to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sbirsttr_funding.csv`: This file includes the SBIR/STTR funding records associated with each company. It contains data such as start date, end date, funding amount, contract number, solicitation number, and more. You can also customize which data points are included in this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that using a UEI for searching is not the only method available. Due to inconsistencies in naming across different sources, using a common identifier like a UEI or DUNS number often provides more reliable results. While you can perform a broader search using company names, this approach may require more effort in data cleaning.\n",
