 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to\r\ndevelop a revolutionary, yet simple and well-designed technique for the cost effective\r\ndeposition of compound semiconductor epitaxial material mesa arrays on large (300mm)\r\nsilicon wafers. The subsequent processing steps integrate smoothly with silicon CMOS\r\n(Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) processing similar to the current SiGe\r\n(Silicon Germanium) BiCMOS (Bipolar CMOS) technology. Previous attempts at the\r\nintegration of III-V materials with silicon have had limited success due to many factors\r\nincluding high cost, CMOS incompatibility, small wafer size, and a lack of technological\r\nand market readiness. In contrast, the proposed solution is very cost effective, and it\r\nbuilds on recent technological progress in advanced materials deposition and handling.\r\nThe vehicle chosen for the demonstration of this technology is the fabrication of high\r\nspeed VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) arrays on silicon. The immediate\r\napplication is in high speed interconnects for computer systems and peripherals including\r\nnext generation USB (Universal Serial Bus) cables.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the following\r\naspects: This technology can merge the advanced compound semiconductor materials\r\nwith the superior processing and efficiency of silicon ICs. This will end years of isolated\r\ndevelopment and will bring new electronic and optoelectronic device capabilities to\r\nmainstream silicon processing. In electronics applications, high speed and high power\r\ntransistors based on InP, and GaN device technologies will be processed with silicon\r\nCMOS on large wafers. This will integrate advanced analog and power functions with\r\nsilicon CMOS based control and processing. In addition, it will offer an alternative route\r\nfor the continuation of performance enhancement in silicon ICs independent of feature\r\nsize reduction. In optoelectronics, the integration of GaAs and InP based optical emitters\r\nand receivers on silicon will allow the miniaturization and cost reduction of optical\r\ntransmitter and receiver modules. The seamless integration of optical and electronic\r\nfunctions on silicon chips will lead to faster interconnects and will significantly reduce\r\nthe cost per bit in fiber optic signal transmission.",
