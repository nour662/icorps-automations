Students will be notified of the funding opportunity through a broadly circulated announcement, and they will be asked to submit a brief resume, a one-page explanation of why they want to attend the Congress and a supporting statement from their faculty advisor. Applicants will be selected for support by a group of faculty based on their interest in attending the Congress, their understanding of the opportunities that attendance offers, and the letter of support from their faculty advisor. Students will also be expected to present their research in a student poster symposium. \r\n\r\nIt is expected that this opportunity will enhance the education of the involved students, who will serve as role models for others as well. A goal in the selection of the students for support will include diversity, which will further enhance the benefits of this support.",
