 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanical behavior of large faults is controlled by thermal, chemical, and hydraulic factors,\r\nas well as each fault's intrinsic structure and the ambient stresses. Understanding what conditions\r\nprevail within the interiors of active faults is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms governing\r\nlong-term fault evolution and, in particular, the earthquake rupture process. This project involves\r\na detailed study of microearthquakes and crustal structure within and surrounding the Alpine\r\nFault, South Island, New Zealand, around the Whataroa fault zone drilling site. It will be carried\r\nout close collaboration with a team of New Zealand scientists. The key scientific issues to be\r\naddressed by this research project include: (1) determining the geometry of the AF to mid-crustal\r\ndepths and the depth to the base of the seismogenic zone, (2) determining focal mechanisms and\r\nestimating principal stress orientations, (3) seismic imaging of crustal structure using multiple\r\nmethods, and (4) searching for possible nonvolcanic tremor (NVT). Our project is designed to\r\ntest a number of hypotheses, including: (1) that the complexity of the surface fault trace does not\r\nreflect the fault trace at depth, rather the partitioning seen at the surface merges into a throughgoing\r\nfault with oblique slip in the upper crust; (2) that the depth to the base of the seismogenic\r\nzone is elevated to 15 km, or perhaps shallower, on the AF beneath the Whataroa area; (3) that\r\nthe AF dip remains close to 50\u00b0 to the base of the seismogenic zone; (4) that principal stress\r\norientations do not vary with distance from the AF; (5) that the relatively low velocity zone\r\nimaged at large scale through much of the crust along the SIGHT transects is actually a narrower\r\nzone closer to the AF, similar to the resistivity model; (6) that NVT is not present beneath the\r\nAF.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to examine the structure and microearthquake characteristics of a\r\nmajor active continental fault, the Alpine Fault, South Island, New Zealand. The Alpine Fault is\r\nlate in its earthquake cycle and is the focus of a long-term, multidisciplinary scientific\r\ninvestigation. In this project, we will carry out seismic field work and subsequent analyses of\r\nmicroearthquakes associated with the Alpine Fault. The research will be conducted in\r\nconjunction with an ambitious fault zone drilling project focused on the mechanical properties of\r\nthe Alpine Fault and the adjacent crust. Their work will help (1) define the geometry of the fault\r\nat depth, (2) determine the depth range of seismic activity (the \"seismogenic zone\"), (3) establish\r\na three-dimensional structural context for interpreting borehole observations and core, and (4)\r\npotentially help to define rupture zones of shallow earthquakes as future drilling targets.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit.  The principal objective of this project was to provide detailed information about the disposition of the Alpine Fault in the south island of New Zealand, primarily to assist in the logistics of the fault zone drilling project at the proposed site near the town of Whataroa.   To do so, we installed and operated a seismic network (WIZARD) consisting of a combination of short and intermediate period sensors in the Whataroa region for a period of two years, and analyzed the recorded data to generate a catalogue of high precision earthquake locations and a high resolution image of the three-dimensional P- (Vp) and S-wave (Vs) velocity structure.  The final model is derived from a combination of local earthquake arrival time and ambient noise tomography.   Our results show a clear Vp contrast across the fault near the drill site and at depths of 5&ndash;10 km, with Vp higher on the southeast, or hanging wall side, of the fault.  The Vs model shows a well-defined body of high (&gt; 3.7 km/s) Vs within the hanging wall. Our earthquake relocations show the presence of clusters within and around low-velocity zones in the hanging wall southeast of the Alpine Fault.  Together with the improved earthquake locations, the P- and S-wave tomography results show that the Alpine Fault is marked by a velocity contrast throughout most of the region near the drill site. The velocity structure, seismicity and observations of fault zone guided waves all show that the fault dips southeastwards at about 50&deg; from 5 to 15 km depth.  We infer that the Alpine Fault is listric, dipping steeply in the upper crust (50&ndash;60&deg;) and flattening to 25&ndash;30&deg; in the lower crust. The base of the seismogenic zone shallows from about15?km beneath the footwall and Alpine Fault to about 6?km beneath the Southern Alps Main Divide.  About 10?km further southeast, it then deepens to about 15?km.  A brittle&ndash;ductile transition overlies a broad low-velocity zone, which together likely result from the presence of fluids and elevated temperatures brought about by enhanced exhumation rate in this section of the Alpine Fault.\n\nBroader Impacts.  This project was a collaboration between Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.   Several students from each collaborating partner participated in the collection and analyses of the data used in this project.    At RPI, three students (Ben Baker, Anastasia Rodzienko, and John Moore) participated in field work and subsequent data analysis; the efforts of one of them (John Moore) were used to obtain his M.S. degree.   The data collected during this project has been archived at the IRIS DMS and currently is public domain.    As a result of having to detect and locate small earthquakes, work on this project led to the creation of novel algorithms for signal detection and onset estimation by both UW and RPI.  On the RPI side, an algorithm written as part of this project to detect small events by signal matching was later combined with one generated by UW to produce a robust catalogue generator.  That algorithm is now public domain and is currently being used by several institutions world-wide.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/20/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven W Roecker"
