 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support two researchers, one senior and one junior, from the U.S. under the direction of Dr. Therese A. Markow, on a planning visit to Argentina to take place in November 2010.  The primary goal of this visit is to develop collaborations on Catcophilic Drosophila research between investigators and students at the University of California-San Diego, Universidad de Buenos Aires in Argentina, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, and Universidad de Chile in Chile. The planning trip is intended to produce the blueprint for a a PIRE proposal and possibly others to be submitted during the following year. The researchers will compare the biology of two Drosophila-cactus systems that evolved independently, one in North and the other in South America.  The research topics to be discussed include the evolutionary genetics of host shifts, reproductive isolation and genetic differentiation (speciation), ecological interactions, and general patterns. This multinational effort will be useful in developing international, broad-based strategies to manage responses to global change.\r\n\r\nThe collaborators will bring complementary skills to the project. The U. S. researchers specialize on the North American system while the researchers from Argentina, Brazil, and Chile have extensive experience with the South American system. The planning meetings will be teleconferenced to the home institutions of all the PIs, thus enabling the participation of a large number of students and postdocs in at least five countries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCactophilic Drosophila are an exciting group of fruit flies which feed and develop in the rotten tissues of several species of cacti.  Several species of cactophilic Drosophila inhabit the deserts of North America.  Since their description in the early 1940s, these species have been a focus on multiple studies in the fields ecology, behavior, physiology, chemical detoxification, evolution, genetics and most recently genomics.  Actually, the entire genome of one cactophilic Drosophila species (D. mojavensis) has already been sequenced.   One fascinating feature of these flies is that different species, and in some cases different populations, utilize different cactus species who possess unique chemical compositions.  It is these compounds, some of which are toxic, that the flies have adapted to. \n\nThe labs of Dr. Markow (University of California San Diego) and Dr. Matzkin (University of Alabama in Huntsville) have for several years worked on the ecology, evolution and genetics of several North American cactophilic Drosophila. Interestingly, cactophilic Drosophila are also found in the deserts of South America.  Comparisons between North and South American cactophilic Drosophila would yield very important information regarding the evolution and genetics of this group of flies.  Therefore, the aim of this Planning Visit award was to have a face-to-face meeting with several South American investigators for the purpose of exchange of ideas and planning of future collaborative projects.  The meeting was a great success, attended by investigators and students from the Universidad de Buenos Aires (Argentina), Universidad de Chile and Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo (Brazil).\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Luciano M Matzkin"
