 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, \"NUE: Nanotechnology EXposure for Undergraduate Students (NUE-NEXUS)\", at Stevens Institute of Technology under the direction of Dr. Eui-Hyeok Yang, seeks to create a nexus between nanotechnology and undergraduate engineering education at Stevens to expand understanding of nanotechnology and its applications to a broad undergraduate engineering student population. In this program, two new nanotechnology courses, NANO 300: Introduction to Nanoscale Science and Engineering and NANO 325: Introduction to Nanofabrication and Characterization, will provide a means to educate a broad student population in nanotechnology. The new courses are dual-purpose, educating the broader engineering student population in nanoscience and nanotechnology while serving as the foundation for those undergraduate students choosing to pursue the undergraduate nanotechnology research track. Since the research track will serve to increase the pipeline of students aiming for graduate programs, documented success will provide a replicable paradigm for others looking to promote undergraduate research as a foundation for future graduate studies.  Integrated within the proposed program are dissemination of nanotechnology educational materials to benefit the engineering education community interested in incorporating nanotechnology into engineering curricula and in bringing appropriate, engaging nanotechnology materials and modular elements to K-12 and community college domains. These proposed elements extend the efforts of the existing interdisciplinary Nanotechnology Graduate Program to the undergraduate level, and are tightly aligned with Stevens' institutional vision of creating a world-class research and education thrust in nanotechnology.",
