The objectives of this S-STEM program are: to provide educational opportunities to socio-economically disadvantaged, minority and female students from South Carolina; to provide an enhanced academic support structure for these S-STEM civil engineering students; and to provide an enhanced leadership development program focusing on principled leadership within the Corps of Cadets and Civil Engineering, as well as developing professional leadership skills. This program provides 23 scholarships over a four-year period and monitors students' progress through graduation, employment and beyond. By providing concentrated faculty, peer, community, and industry support, students are equipped with a comprehensive array of skills needed to succeed in the civil engineering profession. Upon completion of an enriching four-year educational and student development experience, graduates will use their knowledge of civil engineering and interpersonal skills to address society's need for a safe, healthy, sustainable, and equitable built-environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEnhancing Undergraduate Civil Engineering Opportunities for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, Minority and Female Students in SC (K. Bower; NSF #1059945; $593,250; Dates: Aug. 2011 - 2017)\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit:  The original goals of the project were as follows: 1) Provide higher education funding opportunities targeting socio-economically disadvantaged, minority and female students from the Southeast US entering civil engineering, 2) Provide enhanced academic support structure for S-STEM civil engineering students, and 3) Provide enhanced leadership development program focusing on principled leadership within the Corps of Cadets and Civil Engineering, as well as developing professional leadership skills.  The S-STEM funded ExCEL (Excellence in Civil Engineering Leadership) scholarship program, based on best practices in student retention, met all of these goals.  In total, the ExCEL program funded 34 scholarship recipients at an average of $3400 per semester, per student ($541,600 in total scholarship funds, 91% of ExCEL budget).  In addition to monetary support, the ExCEL program also provides students with personalized academic support and professional development opportunities.  Over the course of the program, the ExCEL recipients held a total of 39 leadership position both within the Corps of Cadets as well as the ASCE Student Chapter.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:  ExCEL recruitment and retention efforts have broadened the civil engineering workforce.  Of the 34 recipients, 85% have graduated (or will graduate) with a STEM degree, 79% have (or will) graduate with a civil engineering degree from The Citadel, and 65% met (or will meet) all academic requirements to graduate from the ExCEL program.  All of the graduates are currently either employed in STEM related careers or in STEM related graduate education programs.  Results have been disseminated in two publications to date.  In addition, The Citadel has recently developed several new scholarship programs utilizing funding from The Citadel Foundation.  Lessons learned from the ExCEL program as well as major elements found to be successful were used to develop the new policies and procedures for these new scholarship programs.  This year a total of 18 students have received scholarship totaling $45,000/ year through this program which will utilize many of the personalized academic support and professional development opportunities piloted in the ExCEL program.  In addition to the new scholarship program, The Citadel has had one of its most successful years for women and minority student recruiting.  The Civil and Environmental Engineering Program at The Citadel is using successful elements from the ExCEL program to build a cohort program entitled \"Emerging Leaders\" to improve persistence and encourage leadership development among this important underrepresented group. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin C Bower"
