 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThis collaborative GOALI proposal between researchers of the University of California, Riverside (UCR), Florida International University (FIU), MagOasis LLC, and Western Digital Corporation (WDC) presents interdisciplinary research to study three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic recording, a promising and challenging near- and long-term solution to increasing the capacity of electronic and computer devices. Unlike 2-D alternatives, 3-D recording exploits advantages of using a 3rd spatial dimension to store information.  The specific goals will include: (i) a study of different modes of 3-D recording, (ii) understanding the physics underlying write processes in 3-D systems, (iii) fabrication of 3-D media with three or more magnetic layers accessible for write/read processes, (iv) a basic study of 3-D media with a focus to understand thermal fluctuations in 3-D structures, (v) an investigation of new data coding channels to gain from the multilevel signal configuration in 3-D recording, and (vi) an industry-standard spinstand testing to demonstrate areal densities above 1 terabit/in2. One of the important research objectives will be to understand the physics of 3-D recording necessary for achieving effective areal densities substantially above 1 terabit/in2. The experimental study, involving (i) extensive fabrication via sputter deposition and combinatorial chemistry synthesis, ultra-high-density patterning via electron beam lithography (EBL), (ii) focused Kerr microscopy and ultra-high resolution magnetic force microscopy, (iii) measurements of heat propagation in 3-D, and (iv) a spinstand study to simulate recording systems, will be supported by numerical simulations to understand the micromagnetics in 3-D systems and a basic theoretical study to devise adequate multilevel data coding methods.  Accordingly, the effort will follow a cross-disciplinary direction through involving experts in magnetic recording, materials science, micromagnetic modeling, and signal processing from both academia and industry. Particularly, the project will employ the complementing strengths of five co-investigators with a history of synergetic collaboration including (i) Sakhrat Khizroev at Florida International University (FIU)  for Magnetic Recording and Nanofabrication, (ii) Alex Balandin at UCR for Heat Management at Nanoscale, (iii) Ilya Dumer at UCR  for Data Coding,  (iv) John Oti at MagOasis LLC  for Micromagnetic Simulations, and (v) Rabee Ikkawi at Western Digital Corporation (WDC) for Disk Drive Integration and Spinstand Testing, respectively.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThis project might have a significant impact on the data storage industry especially today when the progress in the multi-billion-dollar industry is facing a fundamental limit to scaling due to thermal instabilities in the recording media. The main targeted deliverable of the project is a cross-disciplinary basic study to demonstrate a record high information density over 1 terabit/in2 using the disruptive technology of 3-D magnetic recording. As one of the pioneering concepts in the broad area of 3-D devices, 3-D recording may pave a way to the new era of 3-D magneto-electronics and 3-D electronics applications in general3. The proposed educational component includes a new university-wide initiative to establish a channel for industry internships for both undergraduate and graduate level students. The connection to the industry will be secured through involvement of John Oti, President of MagOasis LLC, and Rabee Ikkawi, a Principal Engineer of Western Digital Corporation, as the industry Co-PI and Senior Personnel, respectively.  UCR is one of America?s most ethnically diverse research institutions with a dominant Asian American body and 35% Hispanic enrollment. FIU is the largest Hispanic serving institution in the mainland U.S.A. The investigators commit to make every effort to assure diversity among the students who work on this project.  In particular, they intend to do this in part by recruiting from the student chapters of the Society of Women Engineers, the National Society of Black Engineers, and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, among others. In addition, the PIs have established a tradition of hosting local high-school students to give them tours of state-of-the-art research labs with the goal to attract students to become future engineers. Finally, the PIs intend to organize the next anticipated IEEE Nanoscale Device and System Integration (NDSI)-2012 conference to help broaden the research preparation of current students in the minority serving institutions and further attract talent with an emphasis on underrepresented students.",
