 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flooding and slope failures due to heavy precipitation are the most serious weather-related threats for the west coast of North America.  Between 1980 and 2008, four flooding disasters in California, Oregon, and Washington caused losses of more than eleven billion dollars.  Flooding and slope failures associated with heavy precipitation have produced a majority of presidential disaster declarations in Oregon and Washington, and nearly a quarter of such declarations in California.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\nAlthough a great deal has been learned during the last decade about the nature of West Coast heavy precipitation events, major scientific questions are still outstanding regarding their antecedents, regional and large-scale meteorological environments, necessary conditions, and trends in frequency or intensity. These interrelated questions will be considered in this investigation.  The specific objectives of the project include: (1) determining the climatology of heavy precipitation events for the region from northern California to the Canadian border, as well as their temporal and spatial characteristics, (2) identifying the large-scale and regional conditions associated with such events, (3) determining the characteristics of the incoming flow during major precipitation events, (4) evaluating the realism of high-resolution forecasts of heavy West Coast precipitation and determining which model physics produces the most accurate simulations, (5) determining the detailed atmospheric evolutions associated with these events by diagnosing the high-resolution simulations, (6) establishing the historical trends of heavy precipitation events over the past 60 years, and (7) determining the future trends of heavy precipitation over the region for the next century by using high-resolution regional simulations forced by global climate models.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in its unique, comprehensive, and synergistic examination of the characteristics of West Coast heavy precipitation events, ranging from their climatology, the conditions associated with their initiation, associated large and regional scale meteorological structures, the ability of models to properly simulate these events, past trends in heavy precipitation frequency, and future trends based on climate model output. The work will resolve a number of major scientific questions about this important meteorological phenomenon.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nThe scientific issues investigated in this project impact the ability of the meteorological and hydrological communities to provide timely and accurate warnings of upcoming heavy precipitation events.  The research also benefits society by providing necessary information for infrastructure and regional planning.  Another issue relevant to societal importance deals with past trends in West Coast heavy precipitation and how these trends will change under anthropogenic global warming.  Finally, this research should lead to information of value in other parts of the globe where heavy midlatitude orographic precipitation is significant.",

Although a great deal has been learned about the nature of West Coast heavy precipitation events, major scientific questions are had been outstanding about their antecedents, frequency, local and large-scale environments, and past/future trends. This project has made considerable progress regarding this important subject.\n\n   The research determined the top 60 heavy precipitation events at West Coast locations from Washington State to California, evaluating both their contemporary frequencies and the trends over the past half-century.  It was found that frequency of extreme events has increased over Washington, but declined over northern California and southern Oregon. The atmospheric evolution for each of these events was examined, allowing a detailed description of the large-scale flow situations that produced them.  It was shown that most were associated with atmospheric rivers, relatively narrow currents of warm, moist air that move northward out of the tropics and subtropics.\n\n    The future frequency of atmospheric rivers was examined by looking at a collection of nearly two-dozen climate model simulations for the 21st century.   It was found that number, structure, and evolution of atmospheric rivers should change minimally during the 21st century, but the intensity of the strongest atmospheric rivers should increase because the atmosphere will hold considerably more moisture.   Thus, the most extreme atmospheric rivers, and associated precipitation and flooding, should worsen by the end of the century.\n\n   To better understand the control of precipitation contrasts across terrain barriers, the difference of precipitation across the Cascade Mountains was examined over a multi-year period.  This work revealed that contrasts are small as warm/occluded fronts approach or pass over the terrain, but increase substantially when onshore flow is strong and during periods after cold frontal passage.  \n\n    To increase understanding of the impacts of small changes in flow direction (or other characteristics) on orographic precipitation, a new model facility was built under this project whereby the community WRF numerical prediction model is driven by idealized soundings.  This idealized approach has revealed the progressive changes in precipitation distribution as wind direction changes.\n\n   Finally, this project has described the westerly wind surges that produce damaging winds within and downstream of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  Studying this feature is important for understanding the nature of gap flow and for predicting a weather feature of substantial societal importance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/01/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Clifford F Mass"
