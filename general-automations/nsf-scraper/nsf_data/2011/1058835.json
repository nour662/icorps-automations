 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Peter Stair of Northwestern is supported by the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the surface chemistry associated with the synthesis of catalytic structures using low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) to prepare heterogeneous catalysts with controlled structures of materials deposited on flat substrates using low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques; (2) to characterize the surface chemistry of the ALD-grown materials using a suite of surface analysis tools; and (3) to study the catalytic chemical transformations of simple molecules relevant to energy and the environment and correlate the catalytic performance with the structure and composition of the ALD-synthesized catalysts.\r\n\r\nThe project will provide fundamental information on elementary bond activation reactions and on the nature of the catalytically active sites of these nanoscale catalytic systems at the atomic level. It will also lead to a better understanding of the structure and activity of practical catalysts of relevance to energy and the chemical industry. The students involved in the project will be provided with highly technical training in surface science and catalysis. They will also gain a broader perspective on heterogeneous catalysis as a result of interactions with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory.",

The deposited metal species are stable because they are trapped by strong binding to the reactive sites. Our initial effort has focused on the growth of Pt in mesoporous zeolite H-MFI. Two types of Pt species, single atoms and clusters, were identified by spectroscopic measurements using CO as a probe molecule. The ratio between these two types of Pt species can be widely tuned by the ALD chemistry. We also observed tha..."
