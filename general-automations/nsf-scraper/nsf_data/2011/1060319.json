 "awd_abstract_narration": "Doctoral student Lisa McAllister, supervised by Dr. Michael Gurven, of the University of California at Santa Barbara, will investigate the determinants and consequences of women's fertility preferences. In many small-scale societies, fertility is not declining as expected. This study will investigate in detail the effects of acculturation and socioeconomic development on fertility and fertility preferences to elucidate more fully what the reasons are for the continuation of high fertility. \r\n\r\nResearch will be carried out among the Tsimane, Amerindian forager-horticulturists of central Bolivia. Women's fertility preferences are posited to be influenced by: (1) economic factors; (2) cultural factors; and (3) women's perceptions of fertility preferences for them. To investigate how these three key areas are affected by socioeconomic development and how they influence women's fertility preferences, three structured interviews will be conducted with each of 240 Tsimane women. These will include fertility preference interviews, resource value interviews and demographic and health interviews.  \r\n\r\nThe significance of the research is that it will help social scientists understand why fertility rates are slow to decline in some societies. It also will help policy makers assist women in transitioning societies to achieve their reproductive goals and improve their socioeconomic status.   Thus, at the end of the study family planning and maternal health workshops will be run in Tsimane villages and reports of the findings given to the Tsimane and Bolivian government and other agencies.  Funding this research also supports the education of a graduate student.",
