Important taxonomy and bibliographic work will be performed during interdisciplinary math/CS reading classes.  Broader outreach activities are conducted in K-12 classrooms and through public STEM- related events in the metropolitan Denver area.\r\n\r\nThe research in the project includes three components.  Given a numerical problem to be solved, the investigator (1) develops an ad-hoc model detailing the theoretical limitations of the computational machine, (2) simulates the execution of an algorithm based on the ad-hoc model, and (3) conducts numerical experiments on the targeted architecture.  The investigator's methodology applies iterate improvements between these three components until they match. Each improvement requires answering several open questions in terms of lower bounds and algorithms.",
