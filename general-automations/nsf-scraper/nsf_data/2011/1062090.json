Matzkin\r\n\r\nScientists are often confronted with a situation where they want to learn the workings inside a black box. Often, they can observe outputs from the black box that are generated from observable inputs into the black box. When the observed magnitude of the outputs depend only on the observed magnitude of the inputs, and the transformation within the black box is linear, simple mathematical equations can help to uniquely determine such transformation. However, when the transformation is nonlinear and the magnitude of the outputs depend on the magnitudes of unobservable inputs as well as on the magnitude of observable inputs, the problem becomes much more difficult. As a simple example, suppose that the black box is a typical individual producing some output. We can observe the quantity of hours the individual works and the output quantity. However, the output quantity will be determined not just by the quantity of hours worked but also by unobservable effort and unobservable ability. Moreover, the relationship can be expected to be nonlinear. As a slightly more complex example, consider a black box where aggregate demand and aggregate supply for a product determine the observed price and aggregate quantity sold of the particular product. We can observe the prices of the production inputs and the income level of the consumers, which partly determine the observed price and quantity. However, the demand for the product will depend not only on consumers' incomes but also on consumers' taste for the product. The price producers will charge will depend not only on the cost of the production inputs but also on unobservable productivity. Prices and quantities sold are determined by the intersection of demand and supply, each of which depend on observable and unobservable variables.\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop methods to estimate the workings of the black box, when outputs of the black box are determined by the intersection of several unknown nonlinear functions, and these nonlinear functions depend on unobservable as well as observable inputs. In the demand and supply example, this would mean estimating the demand and the supply functions, when the demand function depends on consumer's income and unobservable tastes and the supply function depend on production input prices and unobservable productivity. The methods are nonparametric. In other words, the methods do not require specifying either a linear or a nonlinear form for either the demand or the supply functions. The methods also do not require specifying a particular distribution function for the unobservable variables. \r\nAlthough the models considered require making far less assumptions than linear models with additive unobservable variables, the computation and statistical properties of the new estimators is similar to those of the much more restrictive models. After some first stage nonparametric estimation, the final estimators are calculated by matrix inversion and multiplication. The asymptotic distribution of the new estimators is normal, allowing one to use standard procedures for calculating confidence intervals.\r\n\r\nThe new estimators will be applied to several empirical situations, such as estimating the distribution of preferences across households for different expenditure allocations, and estimating the distribution of preferences for products characteristics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn many situations in economics and other fields, one observes outcomes that are determined simultaneously.  The market price and quantity sold of a product are determined simultaneously by where the demand and supply functions intersect.  The equilibrium prices of either substitute or complement commodities are usually determined simultaneously. A company may choose the quantities produced of its different models simultaneously.\n\nOften, one is interested in analyzing the relationships among the variables that are determined simultaneously.   What would be the change in the quantity that consumers are willing to buy of a product if its price increased by a given amount?  How would the price of oranges change if the price of apples changed?  By how much would a company increase production of its Model A if it were forced to decrease production of its Model B?  Answers to these questions provide insight into consumers' preferences, markets interactions, and production technologies.  They are needed to predict outcomes when the relationships among the variables change.\n\nThis project developed econometric methods to answer questions such as the ones above.  Using observations on outcomes that are determined simultaneously, the new methods provide estimates on the relationships among the variables. The observable outcome variables may be determined not only by other observable variables but also by unobservable ones.  These may affect the observable outcome variables in unspecified, nonadditive ways.  The functional forms for the relationships need not be known.  Most of the new estimators are easily computed, using equations analogous to Linear Least Squares methods.  Confidence intervals are also easily computed.\n\nThe applications studied in the project include the estimation of consumer demand, which depends on unobservable tastes. Given the expenditures on different products chosen by a consumer for some observed prices and income, a method was developed to predict the expenditures by the same consumer for different prices and/or income.\n\nAlthough the results obtained in the project were motivated by questions in economics, they can be applied in many other fields.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/06/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rosa L Matzkin"
