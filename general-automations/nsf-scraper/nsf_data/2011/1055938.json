 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Tricking 'old' materials to offer new properties has been a tradition in materials science and engineering innovations. It is recognized that completely new functionalities may be stabilized at the nanometer-thick wall between two different domains of the same material. These domain walls can be written, moved, broadened, and erased by external stimuli. Thus, they present an exciting opportunity to investigate new low-dimensional physics that is otherwise inaccessible. They can also be used as an active element in a new technology leveraging the functionality, mobility, and truly nanoscale thickness of the walls to achieve much higher device density and lower energy consumption. This project explores the scientific foundations of domain wall technology by understanding and exploiting novel physics and functionalities of ferroic domain walls in oxide materials. Since domain walls exist ubiquitously in nature, a full understanding of their static and dynamic properties benefits our society by broadly impacting existing fields such as ferroelectricity, magnetism, shape memory alloys, and even seismology. The educational objective of this proposal is to build a program to broaden the impact of nanoscience both scientifically and societal in the San Francisco Bay area. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: Future domain-wall technology could be implemented through ferroelectric, thermoelectric, optical, chemical, magnetic and structural functionalities present at the domain walls of a wide variety of materials. At present how to manipulate the domain walls without adversely affecting the desired wall functionality is unknown.  Using locally injected point defects and globally imposed strain as control stimuli, the PI will create, image, pin, liberate, move, and erase single domain walls in a one-dimensional \"wall waveguide\". By doing so, the PI seeks to clear some fundamental roadblocks toward a full understanding of the physics and engineering principles of functional domain walls: i) the domain wall width and mobility will be tailored, ii) the wall functionality will be modulated and exploited for applications, iii) the Landau theory will be parametrized, the discoveries will be generalized, and iv) atomic-scale interfacial physics at the wall will be elucidated.  Integrated with the research efforts, the PI has a unique educational program, entitled \"Nano'ed\", to prepare students for careers in areas of high national interest in either academia or industry.  By emphasizing the common fundamentals that nanoscience shares with established subjects of physics, chemistry and mathematics, the PI is working on the following: i) creating a series of hands-on exhibits and experiments for K-12 students in partnership with the nearby museum Lawrence Hall of Science; ii) partnering with a campus education program in developing a unique summer class series in \"Nanoscale Materials Science and Engineering\" for underrepresented high school students; and iii) initiating and leading nanoscience activities in the San Francisco Bay area to transfer and exchange knowledge with industry and policy-makers, thus making the benefits of fundamental science research more tangible for society in general.",

These papers were accumulatively cited for 230 times as of September 2016. Our work has not only shaped the research field of functional nanomaterials especially those with phase transition and low dimension, but also trained new workforce for industry and research community; coupled with our outreach activities, our work also impacted K-12 education, especially middle school students during their visit of our labs. The major outcomes are listed below:</p>\n<p>1. Mechanics and dynamics of strain-induced structural phase transition in VO2 and BiFeO3 nanomaterials. VO2 exhibits a rich phase behavior of insulating monoclinic (M1, M2) and triclinic (T) and metallic tetragonal (R) phases. By using micro-Raman spectroscopy and independent control of temperature and uniaxial strain in individual single-crystal microbeams, we map these insulating phases with their associated structural changes as represented by their respective phonon frequencies. The results suggest that understanding the driving forces that determine the interplay between M1, M2, and T phases near the MIT could be critical for the identification of the underlying mechanism behind the MIT itself. The elastic properties and structural phase transitions of individual VO2 were determined using an in situ push-to-pull microelectromechanical device, as well as with a diamond anvil cell. These studies demonstrate new ways to investigate nanoscale mechanics and dynamics of structural phase transitions in general.</p>\n<p>2. Large Reaction Rate Enhancement in Formation of Ultrathin AuSi Eutectic Layers. Metal-semiconductor eutectic liquids play a key role in both the fundamental understanding of atomic interactions and nanoscale synthesis and catalysis. At reduced sizes they exhibit properties distinct from the bulk. In this work we show an unusual effect that the formation of AuSi eutectic liquid layers is much easier for smaller thicknesses. The alloying reaction rate is enhanced by over 20 times when the thickness is reduced from 300 to 20 nm. The strong enhancement is attributed to a strain-induced increase in the chemical potential of the solid layer prior to the alloying reaction.</p>\n<p>3. Gate-Controlled Surface Metal-Insulator Transition and mechanical resonator of VO2. Two-dimensional electron systems offer enormous opportunities for science discoveries and technological innovations. We discovered a dense electron system on the surface of single-crystal vanadium dioxide nanobeam via electrolyte gating. The dense surface electron system can be reversibly tuned by the gating electric field, which provides direct evidence of the electron correlation driving mechanism of the phase transition in VO2. It also offers a new material platform for implementing Mott transistor and novel sensors and investigating low-dimensional correlated electron behavior. We also dynamically tracked the strain across the metal-insulator transition in VO2 measured using electromechanical resonators.</p>\n<p>4. Simultaneous enhancement of electrical conductivity and thermopower in Bi2Te3 by native defects. In this work we demonstrate a novel way to drastically enhance thermoelectric power factor and figure of merit of Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> by up to an order of magnitude, utilizing native point defects to break the usual antagonistic coupling among the three key thermoelectric parameters. Our results suggest that a significant improvement of the thermoelectric performance can be achieved through a judicious control of the native defect species and their density by post-growth irradiation damage. As these defects are expected to be generated and behave in the similar way in a wide range of narrow-bandgap semiconductors, it is possible to extend this method to other materials.</p>\n<p>5. Ferroelectrically gated atomically thin semiconductors as non-volatile memory. In this work we demonstrate a novel type of high-performance non-volatile memory devices exploiting heterostructures interfacing two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide with thin films of ferroelectric oxides. Our prototype devices show superior performance, such as low switching voltages, high ON/OFF ratios, and long data retention in comparison to existing FeFET memories. In addition, an optical memory effect was observed with large modulation of photoluminescence tuned by the ferroelectric gating, finding potential applications in optoelectronics and valleytronics.</p>\n<p>6.
