Smith\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests four Shipboard Scientific Support items for Duke University for use aboard the R/V CAPE HATTERAS; namely a new integrated navigation system, 20-foot storage containers, gravity core stand, and ?auto-render/recover? for an existing trawl winch. It also includes funding for a group purchase of engineering support to begin bringing vessels into compliance with emergent UNOLS Research Vessel Safety Standards (RVSS), Appendix B requirements.  All items will either enhance safety or provide greatly improved support capabilities to science.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact and Intellectual Merit:  The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit of the proposed equipment specifically for the R/V CAPE HATTERAS as well as the broader Fleet.  The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit.  During operations, the CAPE HATTERAS routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  The vessel is also routinely open for tours for undergraduate, high school and middle school students as well as civic groups like Scout troops and museums.  The PI and marine operations group have also investigated the use of bio-fuel on board the ship and will be hosting the NSF-funded ?Green Ship Workshop? in early 2012.  As a regional vessel, the R/V CAPE HATTERAS was involved in the rapid scientific response to the Deep Water Horizon oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, and is scheduled to support nearly 70 NSF-funded days in CY 2011.",
