 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Type 1 Noyce project aims to produce 39 certified Noyce Scholars teaching in high-needs high schools by the end of the grant period, each of them having graduated as a mathematics or science major in a specific scientific discipline.  The project benefits from the institution's prior experience with a Noyce Teaching Fellows Planning Grant (0934604) and a collaborative project with Cal State University, Chico (0733758).  Other partner organizations include the Sacramento Unified school district, the Los Rios Community College District and The Parent Teacher Home Visit Project, a non-profit organization devoted to helping teachers appreciate the cultural and linguistic background of their students. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  Unusual features include early field experiences for the Scholars through a summer biotechnology workshop for high school students, scheduled home visits with mentor teachers to expand the Scholars' knowledge of their students' cultural and linguistic heritage, and a year-long highly structured induction period.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  In addition to the project's contribution to the teaching needs of high-needs school districts this project includes an extensive research project.  It follows the Noyce Scholars' development as teachers with the aim of informing future teacher preparation efforts throughout the California State System.",
