Thus, there is a dire need for holistic research efforts\r\nspanning the stack from physics to systems, and that produce\r\nprototypes and development tools that are of much greater\r\nsophistication than exist today in order to enable commercial\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop on Emerging Technologies for Interconnects will bring\r\ntogether key researchers, industry developers, and program managers in\r\norder to define an agenda for the research and commercial adoption of\r\nemerging interconnect technologies.  Presentations and discussions on\r\nthe \"state of the state-of-the-art\" of emerging technologies for\r\ninterconnects will be followed by break-out sessions and discussions.\r\nThese sessions will identify and articulate the key research\r\nchallenges, and potentially most promising solutions/directions, and\r\nchart the recommended larger-scale national strategy and research\r\nagenda.
