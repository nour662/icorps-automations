 "awd_abstract_narration": "In adult humans, symbiotic microbes outnumber human cells ten to one. The composition of these microbial communities can influence whether individuals are lean or obese and the likelihood that pathogens are able to successfully establish themselves in the body. Amphibians also possess a diverse symbiotic microbiota, and these bacterial symbionts may limit infection by pathogens, such as the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) that has decimated many natural amphibian populations. This research will examine links between three critical diversity components of the symbiotic microbial communities that reside on amphibian skin: taxonomic diversity (number and relative abundance of species), genetic diversity (which genes are turned on), and functional diversity (disease resistance). Using focused field surveys and manipulative experiments, three objectives will be addressed: (1) establish the range of taxonomic, genetic, and functional diversity within the microbial community on five species of host amphibians in Panama, (2) examine how the presence of a pathogen (Bd) impacts diversity components, and (3) examine the relationship between microbial diversity and resistance to disease. As all animals host symbiotic microbes, these results will have broad applicability to other systems, including humans. In addition, new statistical methods for these complex datasets will be developed, which will rapidly expand the ability to integrate these diversity components in a wide array of systems. \r\n\r\nUndergraduate students will be trained in research. In addition, in Panama, a partnership with the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project (PARC) will be established. A PARC intern will be supported to work with school groups to stress the importance of conservation, beneficial microbes and biodiversity.  The partnership with PARC will extend to working with them on novel probiotic solutions, based on antifungal skin bacteria, that will allow successful reintroductions of threatened frogs, thereby helping to restore biodiversity to the Neotropics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhen most people think of bacteria, they think of disease-causing organisms and that bacteria should be controlled and eliminated.  Of course, this makes sense for pathogenic bacteria.  However, the vast majority of bacteria have no harmful effect on plants and animals, including humans.  In fact, many bacterial species are helpful.  One positive function of bacteria is in disease resistance.  This is the basis of the probiotic industry, including products such as yogurt and kefir.  The premise is that the microbial community of the host can be manipulated in a positive way &ndash; for example, if the beneficial bacteria are augmented, then they can resist and fight off the harmful bacteria.\n\nAmphibians are vital in many ways to the ecosystem.  While secretive and often unnoticed by human eyes, salamanders and frogs can be incredibly abundant &ndash; comprising as much total weight as all the birds or mammals in a forest ecosystem.  Since they form a vital link in the food chain between small invertebrates such as insects and larger animals, the loss of salamanders and frogs may well cause profound and potentially unexpected negative effects in the ecosystem. \n\nUnfortunately, amphibians are at risk due to lethal diseases, including a skin disease caused by a fungal species.  The disease-causing organisms are known as Bd and Bsal.  Can we find ways to control this disease by using the amphibian's own helpful, antifungal bacteria?\n\nOur research provided the background research to address this question.  We worked on three species of frogs in Panama that seem to survival once Bd arrives, unlike many other species that collapse and even go extinct.  We used culturing and next-generation genetic sequencing methods to figure out which bacterial species are on the frogs and which ones are antifungal.  We found that a surviving population of frogs had more antifungal bacteria than a naive population where Bd has not arrived yet.  These bacteria can be targets of skin probiotic therapy for amphibians.\n\nWe learned a great many other things too, such as how bacteria get transmitted from one frog to another.  We also discovered in lab experiments that when bacteria compete with each other, they start producing molecules to kill each other.  They don?t produce these molecules when they are not competing.  This information can be helpful in selecting probiotics to save frogs and salamanders.\n\nFrogs and salamanders form a great part of the natural heritage of US and other countries.  They are likely critical in the food chain of many ecosystems and benefit humans in a number of ways, including control of insects in some areas and also providing models for therapeutic drugs based on their skin secretions.  If we are to prevent devastating loses, we must figure out how to protect them from these lethal pathogens, Bd and Bsal, and their own beneficial, antifungal bacteria might just part of the plan to save our amphibians.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/21/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Reid N Harris"
