 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work targets several problems in algebraic and geometric combinatorics.  These problems have applications to many areas of pure and applied mathematics and theoretical physics, e.g., convex geometry, matroid theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, inverse boundary problems, total positivity, cluster algebras, theory of hyperplane arrangements, tropical geometry, branched polymers, theory of solitons, Lie theory, Schubert calculus, quantum cohomology, discriminants, and other areas. Many problems involve the study of special classes of convex polytopes, their combinatorial structure, valuations, and triangulations, and the study of related combinatorial objects. \r\nCombinatorics plays an increasingly important role in science. The project focuses on applications of combinatorial methods to algebraic and geometric problems. Its results will have impact in several areas of pure and applied mathematics and physics. This work will lead to development of new combinatorial techniques and constructions. Some topics from this project are suitable for undergraduate research. This project will increase public awareness of combinatorics and mathematics in general.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project was devoted to several problems in algebraic and geometric combinatorics.  Combinatorics is an area of mathematics that deals with discrete structures, such as graphs, permutations, diagrams, etc.  A typical combinatorial question is ``How to count structures of given type and size?'' Algebraic and geometric combinatorics focuses on combinatorial structures that appear in algebra and geometry, it emphasizes interactions between these fields.  Combinatorics plays an increasingly important role in other areas of pure and applied mathematics and other sciences.  The project deals with combinatorial structures that have deep links with representation theory, algebraic geometry, convex geometry, theory of hyperplane arrangements, and theoretical physics.\nA unique feature of combinatorics is that combinatorial objects are quite visual and easy to understand.  Combinatorial problems are often easier to formulate than problems in other areas.  This is why they are popular in high school competitions and math olympiads.  This does not mean that these problems are trivial; on the contrary, they can be quite challenging.  Some combinatorial problems related to advanced branches of mathematics can be explained to high school students.  They help to introduce talented students to frontiers of modern mathematics.\nOne part of the project was concerned with the study of special convex polytopes: permutohedra, associahedra, root polytopes, alcoved polytopes, etc.  These polytopes have applications to other areas ranging from low-dimensional topology to theoretical physics.  They are related to many classical combinatorial sequences such as the celebrated Catalan numbers and the Eulerian numbers.\nA big part of the project was related to the positive Grassmannian, a beautiful geometric object with a rich combinatorial structure.  It turned out that combinatorial objects that appear in the study of the positive Grassmannian also play a crucial role in problems from many other areas, including inverse boundary problems, Fomin-Zelevinsky?s cluster algebras, statistical mechanics, theory of solitons, matrix completion problems, as well as the study of scattering amplitudes of elementary particles.\nThe PI worked on the project with a team of graduate students, whose research was supported by RA's.   Travel support was also provided for students' participation in conferences and workshops.  The PI suggested problems related to the project for MIT PRIMES (Program for Research in Mathematics, Engineering and Science for High School Students) and RSI (Research Science Institute).  As part of PRIMES and RSI programs, talented high school students solved some of these quite nontrivial problems and won prestigious prizes, including several medals at the Intel Science Talent Search competition and Davidson Fellowship.\nThe PI and the graduate students disseminated research results at many international conferences.  Special efforts were made to attract broader and younger audience.  For example, the PI taught a minicourse at Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia, where undergraduate students from Latin America had an opportunity to learn about recent advances in mathematics.  This project promoted public knowledge of combinatorics and mathematics in general.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexander Postnikov"
