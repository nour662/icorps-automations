 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the effect of near-equatorial islands on climate. A series of experiments, first with a simple, two-dimensional model without the effects of rotation, and then with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MIT-GCM) will be carried out to examine the effects of islands on the distribution of rainfall, the resulting wind field, and hence on large-scale circulation. Experiments with the MIT-GCM will be carried out with simplified geometries that include barriers of negligible width to ocean circulation, but not atmospheric, circulation and with different numbers, distributions, lateral dimensions, and elevations of tropical islands in order to seek scaling relationships between these measures of island extent and the response of the atmosphere and ocean. \r\n\r\nThe goals are two-fold: First, could the growth of islands to build the Maritime Continent have altered atmospheric circulation sufficiently to change the sea-surface temperature distribution in the equatorial Pacific from one resembling a permanent El Ni\u00f1o-like state to its present mean weak La Ni\u00f1a-like state? Second, can parameterizations be derived for the effects of islands on tropical precipitation and ascent that allow GCMs to include the effects of islands that are too small to be resolved in such global models? The broader impacts are high: if islands do play a major role in climate, this study will yield parameterizations that will be useful for including the effects of small islands in model simulations. In addition this work will support a graduate student. \r\n.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWe have two accomplishments to report.\n\nFirst, using a cloud-resolving model, we analyzed the effects of islands, and in particular the diurnal cycle, on the rainfall and temperature structure of the atmosphere.  Among results, we found that the calculated precipitation rate over the island can be more than double the domain average value, with island rainfall occurring primarily in an intense, regular thunderstorm system that forms in the afternoon to early evening each day. In addition, island size affects the magnitude of simulated island rainfall enhancement, the intensity of the convection, and the timing of the rainfall maximum relative to solar noon. A combination of dynamic and thermodynamic mechanisms leads to a monotonic enhancement of domain averaged tropospheric temperature with increasing fraction of island surface.  The simple physics of this rests on heating at the earth\u00c6s surface, at the bottom of the atmosphere.  Warm air rises, but cool air merely spreads out at the surface.  Thus, the addition of islands, which enhances rainfall and latent heating, makes the upper troposphere above domains with islands warmer than without islands.  This heating may contribute to localization of ascent over the Maritime Continent and its relationship to the Walker Circulation.\n\nSecond, we exploited the lessons from this first study and applied them to a compilation of areal extent of islands in the Maritime Continent.  We found that the areal extent of the Maritime Continent (the islands of Indonesia and surrounding region) has grown larger by ~60% since 5Ma.  We then argue that this growth might have altered global climate in two ways that would have contributed to making recurring Ice Ages possible. First, because rainfall over the islands of the Maritime Continent not only is heavier than that over the adjacent ocean but also correlates with the strength of the Walker Circulation, the growth of the Maritime Continent since 5 million years ago may have contributed to the cooling of the eastern tropical Pacific since that time. Scaling relationships between the strength of the Walker Circulation and rainfall over the islands of the Maritime Continent and between sea surface temperature (SST) of the eastern tropical Pacific and the strength of easterly wind stress suggest that the increase in areal extent of islands would lead to a drop in that SST of 0.75&deg;C. Although only a fraction of the 3&ndash;4&deg;C decrease in SSTs between the eastern and western tropical Pacific, the growth of the Maritime Continent may have strengthened the Walker Circulation, increased the east-west temperature gradient across the Pacific and thereby enabled ice sheets to wax and wane over Canada since 3 Ma. Second, because the weathering of basaltic rock under warm, moist conditions extracts CO2 from the atmosphere more rapidly than weathering of other rock or of basalt under cooler or drier conditions, the increase in weathering due to increasing area of basalt in the Maritime Continent may have drawn down enough CO2 from the atmosphere to affect global temperatures. Simple calculations suggest that increased weathering of basalt might have lowered global temperatures by 0.25&deg;C, possibly important for the overall cooling.  Thus, although these simple scalings do not show that the growth of the Maritime Continent can be assigned the cause of changes that allowed recurring Ice Ages since 2.6 &plusmn; 0.1 Ma, that growth may have contributed significantly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter H Molnar"
