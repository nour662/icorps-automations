 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Nebraska Math Scholars Program provides scholarships to financially disadvantaged undergraduate students who major in mathematics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL).  The program attracts and retains talented students by encouraging them to be part of a network of students who are excited about college and about mathematics.  Nebraska Math Scholars participate in an active Math Club, an undergraduate seminar series, regular casual group meetings with faculty and graduate students, and enhanced advising.  Math Scholars attend special workshops and recitation sections where they work in groups on problems designed to strengthen the skills and understanding of concepts necessary for success in their pre-calculus and calculus courses. During their undergraduate careers, the Math Scholars are encouraged to engage in supervised research projects with faculty mentors. In addition, the Nebraska Math Scholars Program includes a bridge program for underprepared graduate students.  The S-STEM Bridge to Graduate School program permits meritorious students to take an extra senior year of mathematics before beginning graduate studies.  The Nebraska Math Scholars Program is increasing the percentage of disadvantaged and/or underrepresented students who succeed academically in STEM fields while expanding the pipeline of students applying to graduate school.",
