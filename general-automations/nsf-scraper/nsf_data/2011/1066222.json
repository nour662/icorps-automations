Pflaum\r\n\r\nThe award serves to support participants from the U.S. at the\r\nconference and school \"Quantization of Singular Spaces\" in\r\nDecember 2010 at the Center for Quantum Geometry of Moduli Spaces\r\nin Aarhus, Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe supported conference will be aimed at recent approaches to\r\nquantization of singular spaces. The goal of the conference is to\r\nencourage cross-fertilization among various approaches, to bring\r\nseemingly independent lines of research together, and to consider\r\nwhere the field can go in the future.  It is expected to give a\r\nstrong impetus to innovative work in the field. In addition, the\r\nworkshop is aimed at training young researchers in the field by\r\ninternationally renowned experts.  A mathematically rigorous\r\ntheory of singular quantization would have considerable\r\nrepercussions. For example, in mathematical physics a better\r\nunderstanding of the nonperturbative structure of gauge theories\r\nwould come within reach, which would be essential preparation for\r\nthe construction of quantized Yang--Mills theories and grand\r\nunified theories.  In mathematics, new index theorems for\r\nsingular spaces would emerge, among other.\r\n\r\nSupport for the conference will ensure that experts from the\r\nU.S. working in the field of quantization theory will be able to\r\nsignificantly contribute to the conference and will profit from\r\nthe exchange of cutting-edge research.  Moreover, support for the\r\nschool and conference will enable U.S.-based young researchers to\r\nparticipate in the special training which will be offered through\r\nthree minicourses on foundational material and recent\r\nachievements in the field during a school preceeding the\r\nconference.  The conference and school in Denmark will also\r\nstrengthen US-Scandinavian research connections and will lead to\r\nnew scientific collaborations.\r\n\r\nConference webpage:\r\n\r\nhttp://qgm.au.dk/events/dec-2010-conference-quantization-of-singular-spaces/",
