 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Nemykin of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) will explore synthetic pathways for the preparation of organometallic porphyrins and their aromatic macrocyclic analogues. While chemistry of simple organometallic compounds (i.e. ferrocenes) is well-explored, little progress has been made in the development of organometallic aromatic macrocycles. Dr. Nemykin and others have recently shown that introduction of organometallic substituents into the porphyrin core results in rare long-range metal-metal coupling properties, which are essential for the application of such compounds in molecular electronics, random access memory devices and components for near infra-red optical limiters.  Electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and chemical oxidation methods will be used to identify the properties of the target compounds. \r\n\t\t\r\nThis work could result in the preparation of efficient modules for molecular electronics and redox-driven sensors. Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on any area in which the synthesis of molecules is needed, such as microelectronics, environmental engineering, as well as biological and chemical research activities. In addition, this project will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate (M.S.) students, as well as for a post-doctoral researcher who will be both teaching and conducting research in preparation for a career at a predominantly undergraduate institution.",
