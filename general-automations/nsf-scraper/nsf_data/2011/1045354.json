The workshop will include a mix of presentations and discussion, centered around the following five topics 1. Complex bio-molecular dynamics. 2. Molecular spectroscopy in the gas phase. 3. Terahertz-to-infrared microscopy/nanoscopy, nanoscale phenomenon, surface interactions, etc. 4. Condensed matter I - frequency domain spectroscopy 5. Condensed matter II - non-linear and ultrafast phenomena. The workshop will assess the potential broader impacts that could result from the development of advanced terahertz-to-infrared light sources, both in terms of the research that they will enable, and in terms of technical education in areas that are vital to the nation?s continued scientific competitiveness.  The conference will give preference to women and minority scientists and is co-funded by the Physics, Chemistry Divisions, the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, and by the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.",
