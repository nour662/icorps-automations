 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel set of compounds that consist of inositol linked to multiple phosphate groups play critical roles in the metabolism and stress responses of many different types of organisms. Preliminary data reveal that these compounds (here called PPx-InsPs) are also present in plants, but very little is known about their synthesis and potential functions. This research will test the hypotheses that PPx-InsPs act as sensors of metabolism and stress in plants, and are critical for basic metabolism during seed development and growth. To test these hypotheses this project will 1) identify and accurately measure the concentrations of PPx-InsPs in plant tissues; 2) identify and characterize plant enzymes that regulate the levels of PPx-InsPs; and 3) characterize the stress responses of plants that contain genetic alterations in the enzymes that regulate the levels of PPx-InsPs. The long-term goals of this collaborative project are to understand how these unique PPx-InsP molecules are regulated in plants and how they help control metabolism, plant stress and phosphate sensing.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. This project will support the education and training of three graduate students, one postdoctoral fellow, and a number of undergraduate students. The diverse interests and backgrounds of the three collaborators (who serve at universities and a USDA research laboratory) offer unique opportunities for synergistic interactions. An exchange of investigators (including postdoctoral fellows and students) will occur between laboratories, providing exposure to different research programs and the experience of working in a large research team. Members of this team will participate in two programs designed to foster the development of young scientists. In one program (Partnership for Research and Education in Plants, or PREP) the research will be integrated into the high school science curriculum by donating plant strains from this project and by working with PREP staff and high school students in inquiry-based learning projects. In the second program, the research team will develop and participate in hands-on activities with over 400 elementary school students in the Kid's Tech University which is held at Virginia Tech each year.",
