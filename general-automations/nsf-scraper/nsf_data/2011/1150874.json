Engineers play a fair role in supporting innovation as vital agents in a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem. Many efforts have been made in engineering education to support student innovation through new courses, new programs, and even new institutions designed with technical innovation as their core goal. Yet, research on how engineering students approach and experience innovation has been limited. Funded by an NSF-supported CAREER project, the project team conducted a series of empirical studies using interviews, think-aloud protocols, and surveys to examine engineering students&rsquo; views of the innovation process, their abilities to innovate, and the type of experiences that support the development of innovative competencies.</p>\n<p>By connecting research from diverse fields and building on the interdisciplinary background of the project PI, this project has developed a framework explaining an innovation ecosystem within engineering education. When students characterize innovation in the context of their engineering education, their views suggest an approach to teaching that we call innovation-based education. This approach includes three components: 1) creating value for oneself, peers, and the project&rsquo;s stakeholders; 2) experiencing a cycle of learning by seeking support when challenged and exert autonomy to engage; and 3) working in an environment that that supports innovation through authenticity, autonomy, support, interest, and novelty (See Figure 1). As part of this framework, the assessment of student learning should also be aligned with these components including embracing the unique and unexpected student outcomes that innovation projects can provide.</p>\n<p>In one study, we examined engineering students&rsquo; understanding of innovation as a process. In this study, students were asked to draw their depiction of an innovation process using smart pens. The research team analyzed two aspects of these drawings: (1) the stage of innovation illustrated and (2) the area that the innovation has focused on. The analysis of the innovation stages revealed that students were more familiar with opportunity identification stage of innovation than later stages of innovation such as life-cycle management (See Figure 2). Students also emphasized the technological elements of the innovation process compared to strategic and societal elements.</p>\n<p>In another influential study, the project team explored differences in the experiences of students with innovation through courses, internships, projects, etc. In this study, the team interviewed with a diverse group of students who studied engineering. This study resulted in 8 unique ways of experiencing innovation that differ based on the amount of focus on technology and the elaboration of the innovation process. These levels, illustrated in Figure 3, are innovation as: realizing a technical function, redesigning to meet stakeholder criteria, solving a stakeholder problem, filling a gap in market, benefiting a client with new solution, making a difference for a user, helping societal progress, and developing a radically new technology.</p>\n<p>Informed by these studies, this research project has expanded our understanding how engineering students characterize innovation and provides recommendations on developing more responsive and effective design projects and approaches to teaching and assessment that support innovative competencies. The research recommendations for educators are as following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>design projects should be positioned with the broader innovation process stages in mind and target specific competencies within these stages (e.g., questioning methods for opportunity identification). </li>\n<li>design projects must be designed with attention to student motivation factors and evaluated based on their ability to support self-directed learning as students create value for themselves and others. </li>\n<li>teaching and assessment methods must be carefully organized to address key learning objectives and should be diversified to illustrate a culture of innovation.</li>\n<li>educators must recognize variations in student experiences and views of innovation but at the same time highlight that innovation is not only a function of developing technologies but also meeting human needs and establishing enterprises. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In conclusion, this project has produced research on how engineering students innovate and how educational interventions support the development of these skills. The outcomes of this project have also resulted in recommendations to enhance the education and training of innovative engineers, with long-term impact on continuous growth of our economic viability. Although not all students need to be innovators defined in a traditional sense, all students would benefit from learning to be innovative. To be prepared for 21<sup>st</sup> century engineering, students need the skills to innovate. Innovation is a key skill necessary for all engineers, and essential to the prosperity of our society.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/20/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Senay&nbsp;Purzer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150874/1150874_10134700_1524236285608_Figure2_Phasesofinnvoationinprocessmaps--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150874/1150874_10134700_1524236285608_Figure2_Phasesofinnvoationinprocessmaps--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150874/1150874_10134700_1524236285608_Figure2_Phasesofinnvoationinprocessmaps--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Frequency of instances referring to specific phases of innovation in students? drawings of the innovation process</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Senay Purzer</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Senay&nbsp;Purzer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150874/1150874_10134700_1524236178703_Figure1_Studentperspectivesofinnovation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150874/1150874_10134700_1524236178703_Figure1_Studentperspectivesofinnovation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150874/1150874_10134700_1524236178703_Figure1_Studentperspectivesofinnovation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">College students? perceptions of what supported innovative thinking in their engineering design projects</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Senay Purzer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Senay&nbsp;Purzer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150874/1150874_10134700_1524236437219_Figure3_Waysstudentsexperienceinnovation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150874/1150874_10134700_1524236437219_Figure3_Waysstudentsexperienceinnovation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150874/1150874_10134700_1524236437219_Figure3_Waysstudentsexperienceinnovation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Eight different ways engineering students experience innovation through curricular and extra-curricular projects</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Senay Purzer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Senay&nbsp;Purzer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
