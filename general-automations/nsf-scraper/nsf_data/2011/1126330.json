 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project, Oklahoma State University High Performance Computing Center (OSUHPCC) will acquire, deploy and maintain an HPC cluster supercomputer, to be named Cowboy, that will support computing-intensive research and research training across a broad variety of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. As a campus-wide shared resource, Cowboy will be available not only to all of OSU's faculty, staff, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates, but to researchers across Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nMany areas of Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDESE) research will be facilitated by the proposed system by collaborating research teams with an expected doubling of the number of users every 12 months based on experience to date. Projects include: mechanics of granular materials and fracture simulations in nuclear clad materials; discovery genes for canine hip dysplasia; improvements to performance per Watt of many-core systems; transcriptional profiling of determination events in adult and embryonic murine stem cell lines; genomic, metagenomic and proteomic approaches to decipher host- pathogen interactions, complex carbohydrate metabolism and cellulosic bioenergy; modeling geophysical fluids; computational chemistry; simulations of nanostructured materials; simulation of the growth of carbon nanotubes; simulating gas-phase and condensed-phase materials; seismic characterization of surface geology; computational optimization; optimal error-control coding and compressive sensing techniques; charge, spin and heat transport; molecular phylogeny of the Asteraceae; evolutionary genetics of morphological diversification and domestication in grasses (Poaceae) and mustards (Brassicaceae); robust electromagnetic field testing; phylogenomic analyses of the extremophile red alga Galdieria sulphuraria; integrating data in evolving social networks; computational and combinatorial methods in commutative algebra; microbes associated with non-cultivated and cultivated plants; intensity-modulated radiation therapy planning software; and phylogenomics of milkweeds (Asclepias, Apocynaceae). \r\n\r\nOklahoma users are at 24 institutions, including 11 of Oklahoma's 13 public universities. The Oklahoma Supercomputing Symposium (MRI PI Brunson is 2011 Conference Co-Chair), the only event of its kind held annually in an EPSCoR jurisdiction, in 8 years has had over 2000 attendees from 92 academic institutions in 24 states and Puerto Rico (including 33 in Oklahoma and 26 in 12 other EPSCoR jurisdictions), 97 private companies, 31 government agencies and 14 nonprofits.  This project includes seven women senior personnel who serve as role models and are creating interest and excitement about computational science and engineering. This project also includes participation of two researchers at Langston University, Oklahoma's sole Historically Black University. Research projects include 80 graduate students and 29 undergraduates, including 29 women, an African American, three Native Americans and three Hispanics.",
