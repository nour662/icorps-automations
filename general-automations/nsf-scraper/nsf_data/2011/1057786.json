Speakers from the fields of evolutionary biology, ecology, population genetics, phylogenetics, and paleontology will come together to discuss their latest research and its implications for understanding the process of speciation in the marine environment.\r\n\r\nA symposium on speciation in the marine environment and the published volume that proceed from this symposium will contribute to our understanding of a fundamental biological process, with implications for conservation and biodiversity discovery.",
