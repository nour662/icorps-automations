 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award supports an integrated, interdisciplinary graduate education and research program at Auburn University focused on biorefining concepts for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from renewable resources. The purpose of the program is to train a new generation of engineers and scientists to address the scientific, technological and societal challenges in this area of national need. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The Auburn University IGERT program aims to optimize the entire fiber to fuel lifecycle by advancing biorefining technologies that enable production of fuels and chemicals from a wide range of renewable biomass feedstocks. This project seeks to develop novel thermochemical and biochemical conversion technologies that will lead to technically viable, efficient as well as economic and environmentally sustainable fuel and chemical production strategies. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Integrating biorefineries with existing biomass based industries will allow for significant economic growth through new value-added products and higher resource utilization. This will strengthen the local and regional economies and provide significant job creation, while the national economy will be improved by reinvigorating major manufacturing sectors like the forest products industry. The national economy will benefit from increased independence from foreign crude oil sources, making fuel supply less sensitive to global politics. \r\n\r\nGraduates from this program will be prepared to take on leadership roles in biorefining research. This program provides an integrative education involving interdisciplinary courses, professional development, leadership training, opportunities for industrial interaction, coupled with experiential global learning through collaborative research.\r\n\r\nIGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.",
