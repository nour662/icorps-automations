According to the literature in the field, more than half of job seekers find their positions through personal ties and social connection (social capital).  The concepts of social capital and social ties have become central to the core of sociological thinking, and the theoretical purpose of this study is to test and refine this thinking. However, disagreement persists within this literature about the types of ties that are used by diverse population groups in the job search process, and about the benefit of these ties.  More recently, a rising number of studies have examined the importance of understanding the organizational context in which social ties are activated.  \r\n\r\nThis study has three goals. First, to advance our understanding of the  types of network ties including family, school, and other ties (strong or weak) used by diverse groups of individuals as they search for and attain jobs.  Second, to investigate the organizational context in which school ties are developed and whether academic departments provide resources to help students gain ties.  A longitudinal survey of the college class of 2011 will provide the basis for testing the impact of different types of student social capital on their post-graduate job search and placement, as well as the role organizational context plays in shaping those ties.  As a case in point, the study focuses on Sociology majors, who tend to be found in a wide variety of occupations. Thus, the third goal of this study is to examine whether majors perceive that the jobs they obtain reflect their original field of training and, finally, whether these jobs can be characterized into specific scientific or applied occupational fields and sectors.  The practical focus of this study is whether network ties that are encouraged by academic departments lead majors to jobs in the field.  We will test a series of hypotheses about the type of social capital (network ties) seniors use when searching for jobs, the context in which these social ties develop, and how types of ties vary by race, ethnicity and gender.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis study has broader implications for several stakeholders. Institutions of higher education have a vested interested in understanding the school-to-work transition. A lack of understanding about how academic majors search for and secure jobs, and the kind of social connections that help graduates in this process, can result in arts and science departments losing majors to more vocationally-oriented programs and institutions.  Such loss is also problematic for the science pipeline in general. Moreover, given that today's college students are entering a job market with the highest unemployment in a generation, and are saddled with increasing debt, it is reasonable for students and their parents to be concerned about job prospects.  Ultimately, potential beneficiaries of this proposed longitudinal study include but are not limited to the approximately 17,000 sociology majors that graduate each year and go directly into the labor market and the society which might benefit from their training and skill set.",

The project has produced a series of widely-used research briefs for students and faculty which can be downloaded at the American Sociological Association\u00c6s website (http://www.asanet.org/research/bacc_survey/jobs_for_sociology_majors.cfm).  All research instruments from the project along with the approval document by the Western IRB. Sociology majors from 160 universities throughout the United States, planning on graduating in May or August, 2012, were invited to complete a survey in March-May, 2012.  In the end, 2,695 students returned a questionnaire.  Questions focused on satisfaction with the major, self-reports of the amount learned, and participation in activities both inside and outside the classroom.   They were contacted again for the second wave of the survey  from December, 2012-February, 2013 designed primarily to explore respondents\u00c6 efforts to secure a first job after graduation.  Then, between November, 2013 and January, 2014, 18 months after graduation, these sociology graduates were asked to complete the third-wave questionnaire; 911 graduates did so.  This third questionnaire asked about the type of job secured, the link between the respondent\u00c6s undergraduate experiences and the job, the link between knowledge of concepts and skills and post-graduate well- being.  Comparable questions were asked to students who were enrolled in graduate school. \n\nData from the first questionnaire show that students major in sociology for a combination of liberal arts and practical concerns:  almost 100%t report an important reason for majoring is finding the concepts interesting and 64 % indicate that an important reason is job preparation.  Students\u00c6 overall satisfaction is high, with 74 % reporting being very satisfied with their overall experiences.  Unfortunately, satisfaction is lower with career or graduate school advising, with less than 30 % expressing high satisfaction in these areas, suggesting needed changes.  Students also report that they have learned the key concepts and skills associated with the undergraduate sociology major.  At least 78 %, report that they have learned content in each of five areas such as \"presenting sociological explanations about current social issues.\"  When asked about data analysis and research skills, findings are more mixed.    Students report participation in a wide variety of activities as undergraduates: with more than half reporting that they held an internship.  A key finding from Wave 1 of the project is that students who report the highest levels of learning are the ones who are most satisfied with their undergraduate experiences.\n\nThe second questionnaire gathered data that explore the ways in which new graduates search for employment.  The key finding is that students who use weaker ties,  such as internship supervisors, former employers, college career services, and faculty members, are more likely than those who use the strong ties of family members and friends to find jobs that are career-type jobs. \n\nKey findings from the third-wave questionnaire are that more than half of respondents  are satisfied with the major after 18 months graduation, and more than half said they would major in sociology if they had to do it over again Further, most graduates are in the labor force  with 56 %t holding a job or paid internship and another 8%  viewing work as their primary status (although they both held a job and were in graduate school).  The remainder are in graduate school. The largest number of employed graduates work in social services and counseling.  About 60 % of graduates who view \"work\" as their primary status hold positions that we term \"career type,\" that will can lead to where they want to be in 5 years, and more than one half (57%) have experienced 5 or more (of 11) types of job advancements (such a..."
