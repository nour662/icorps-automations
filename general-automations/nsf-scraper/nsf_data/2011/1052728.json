 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Divisions of Chemistry, Materials Science, and Mathematical Sciences supports two meetings of an experimental program which will test approaches combining reductionist scientific methodologies with integrative scientific methodologies in the form of dialog.  Team approaches to potentially transformative research in solar energy harvesting, capture, and conversion are encouraged through interactive modalities such as Dialog Mapping, which is a method of facilitated dialog, as well as unguided interactions.  The goals of these workshops are to infuse new teams of researchers in the solar energy conversion field and to build creative, multidisciplinary communities that, using dialog, will transform the field, producing breakthrough outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe workshops leverage investments in solar energy made by both Research Corporation for Science Advancement and NSF. The workshops will occur at the Biosphere 2 near Tuscon, Arizona in October, 2010 and 2011.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch Corporation for Science Advancement (RCSA) recently initiated Scialog &ndash; science and dialog &ndash; as a unique program that seeks to catalyze major breakthroughs needed to meet global challenges.  Scialog is focused initially on the conversion of solar energy to electricity and fuels.  The goal of Scialog is to accelerate breakthroughs in solar energy conversion to electricity and fuels through synergy created by grants to researchers with highly innovative ideas, support for intensive dialog at conferences and community building across disciplines.\n\nThe purpose of NSF Award # 1052728 was for the NSF to co-sponsor, with RCSA, the first two Scialog conferences with $50,000 in 2010 and $50,000 in 2011, matched equally by RCSA.  The Scialog Program has demonstrated the potential to be transformative in both process and experimental outcomes, thus responding to the National Science Board's mandate for NSF to fund such activities. \n\nScialog provides catalytic funding to early career scientists in US academia engaged in innovative, high-risk research that has the potential to make transformative advancements in the efficiency, durability and cost of solar energy conversion systems.  Scientists who receive awards are typically not more than five years past earning tenure.  This timeframe is when academicians make the transition from early to mid career. It is the period in which the most important and innovative ideas of a scientific career often emerge.  Having recently received the affirmation and academic freedom conferred by tenure, awardees are poised to attempt that truly transformative research project they have been carrying in their \"back pocket\" but that is just too risky to try while working toward tenure.  RCSA is funding three-year research awards for these early career scientists with innovative ideas.  The first 15 single and four multi-investigator awards totaling $2,500,000 were made to 23 Scialog Fellows in 2010 and 2011.\n\nAnnual meetings are held at Biosphere 2 near Tucson, Arizona and are attended by a diverse group of scientists that participate in highly interactive sessions to identify bottlenecks, find avenues for breakthroughs, and build new scientific teams to facilitate the breakthroughs.  Conference participants are encouraged to self assemble into collaborative cross-disciplinary teams of two to four researchers and write short proposals at the conference for additional seed funding ($100K per team) for highly innovative ideas that emerge from the dialog.  About fifteen NSF SOLAR awardees attended the conference each year, including keynote speakers Eric Mazur (Harvard University) and James McCusker (Michigan State University).  Five NSF SOLAR awardees &ndash; Rene Lopez (UNC Chapel Hill), John Gilbertson &amp; Janelle Leger (Western Washington University), Boaz Ilan (UC Merced) and Christine Luscombe, (University of Washington) &ndash; are members of some of the six successful teams that won Collaborative Innovation Awards based on proposals written at the conferences.  NSF support has been highly leveraged through the participation and success of its awardees at the conferences, as well as the success of Scialog Fellows and other participants.\n\nAt the heart of Scialog is dialog, a methodology involving a special form of communication that suspends immediate critical judgment and debate in favor of listening for what one does not know or understand and building on that.  As novel possibilities are built up in this creative process, it then becomes possible to form new collaborative teams to evaluate and refine novel ideas and hone them into specific projects designed to overcome bottlenecks.  Dialog as manifested in Scialog is aimed at unleashing human imagination.  Dialog erodes the barriers to cross-disciplinary science; uncovers the gaps in the intellectual landscape; and allows multifaceted, as opposed to either-or, opportunities to emerge.   It thereby opens doors to transformation a..."
