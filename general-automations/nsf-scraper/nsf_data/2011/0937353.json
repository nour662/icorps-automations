 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Bruce Jackson created the Research Integrating Molecular and Environmental Sciences (RIMES) Program to address the exceedingly poor record of attracting and retaining ethnic minorities into the field sciences. For ten years the program has successfully guided nontraditional scholars into STEM careers particularly in the field sciences. The RIMES Program provides nontraditional undergraduate scholars from the University of Massachusetts (UMASS), minority serving institutions, and community colleges nationwide with rare, stimulating and extensive research experiences on the volcanic Caribbean island of Montserrat (British Lesser Antilles). The unique geological records of Montserrat provide opportunities for interdisciplinary research on environmental stress, restoration and species adaptation, and form the backdrop for captivating research experiences for underrepresented students that foster enthusiastic participation and elevate the chances that their career choices will fall within these disciplines. Undergraduate scholars in the RIMES Program conduct two consecutive years of highly interdisciplinary research with an international consortium of scientists, headed by Dr. Jackson, studying the environmental impact of Montserrat?s active Souiffre Hills volcano on the terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems of that island. Of great importance, the RIMES Program also positively impacts the scientific careers of faculty from historically black colleges and universities and community colleges as well as the research prowess of their respective institutions. The RIMES Program also provides extensive research experiences seldom afforded to scholars from two-year colleges. RIMES scholars are also supported by an enveloping mentoring program that constantly monitors and sustains their academic endeavors and integrates their research and scholastic activities. The RIMES Program has a retention rate of ninety percent. The RIMES model has demonstrated its ability to increase participation by underrepresented groups in the field sciences. RIMES Scholars and their faculty mentors work together to investigate the impact of volcanic activity on the ecosystem of Montserrat and make a significant intellectual contribution to multiple scientific disciplines and the island. The RIMES Program has demonstrated high success and is a proven, highly replicable model that stimulates the interest of nontraditional scholars for the field sciences. The RIMES Program disseminates its findings to the global scientific and lay communities via publications; conferences, seminars, ReefCheck\u00ae, and the program web site (http://www.uml.edu/rimes/). In 2008 under a Fulbright Scholarship, Dr. Jackson worked to replicate his successful mentoring Model at the Catholic University of Portugal, Porto and bring that institution into the RIMES consortium.",
