Furthermore, the involvement of the undergraduates in engineering research with exposure to ethical issues in tech transfer has implications well beyond the technical scope of the individual research projects, and the inclusion of entrepreneurship shows how research products from the lab transition to products that impact society.  It is expected that undergraduate participants will gain successful admission to graduate school, and become outstanding researchers in their chosen fields and strong contributors to society both as individual researchers and as team oriented professionals.",
