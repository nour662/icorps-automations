 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, Internet usage has grown by more than 3.5 times,\r\nto about 1.6 billion users; about 300 million of these are broadband\r\nsubscribers.  Unfortunately, despite this growing penetration and users'\r\nincreasing reliance on broadband networks for critical or\r\nperformance-sensitive applications, neither the research community nor\r\nindustry knows much about the performance of access links, or how users\r\nconfigure and use networks inside the home.  The lack of visibility into\r\ntoday's home networks makes it nearly impossible to understand the\r\nproblems that users experience in these networks, let alone how to fix\r\nthem.  A critical first step towards improving our understanding of home\r\nnetworks is gathering data from homes.  Towards this end, we are\r\ndeveloping a home network measurement infrastructure consisting of (1)\r\ncustomized routers deployed in homes and (2) a central data collection\r\nserver.  We are deploying both the measurement infrastructure across\r\nhundreds of homes and collecting a corpus of active and passive\r\nmeasurements that will shed more light into home network performance and\r\nuse.  Given the proliferation of network devices in the home and the\r\ngeneral public's growing attention to the performance of access\r\nnetworks, we expect that the infrastructure that we deploy and the data\r\nthat we gather from this infrastructure will play in important role in\r\nimproving our collective understanding of how home networks are used and\r\nhow well they perform.  We will disseminate our results through\r\nconference and journal publications, as well as talks with and\r\npresentations to researchers, policymakers, and practitioners.",
