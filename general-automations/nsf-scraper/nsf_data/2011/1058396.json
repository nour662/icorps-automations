 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports work by Prof. Brian Bennett of the Department of Biophysics at the Medical College of Wisconsin to carry out a time-resolved pulsed-electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic study of the mechanism of iron- and cobalt-containing nitrile hydratases (NHases), in collaboration with Prof. Richard C. Holz (CHE-1058357) at Loyola University, Chicago.  The mechanism of the stereospecific hydration of nitriles by NHases is of fundamental interest, and the reaction is of great practical and economic importance in the pharmaceutical industry.  Isotopically labeled (H-2, C-13, N-15) substrates and NHase enzyme will be incubated and collected by rapid-freeze-quench to trap pre-steady-state and steady-state intermediates, and these will be interrogated by pulsed EPR methods.  Simulations will be used to obtain spin-Hamiltonian parameters from which the structures of the intermediates can be elucidated, and a mechanism deduced.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that this research will pave the way for the design of chemical catalysts and engineered enzymes whose properties can be tailored toward specific substrates and desired reaction properties.  This will greatly increase the range of pharmaceuticals and intermediates that rely on stereoselective nitrile hydration that can be profitably brought to market, and stimulate further research into new compounds of this class.",
