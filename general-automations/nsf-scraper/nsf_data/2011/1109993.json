Riviere and Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of partial differential equations. The 2011 program will feature two principle speakers (Hitoshi Ishii and Michael Taylor), each of whom will give a two-hour lecture, and a number of one-hour talks delivered primarily by young  mathematicians (Xiaochun Li, Yvan Martel, Robert McCann, Susanna Terracini). The program allows ample time for informal discussion among the participants.",
