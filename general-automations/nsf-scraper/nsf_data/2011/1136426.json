 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colorado State University-Pueblo (CSU-Pueblo) is strengthening 7-12 mathematics achievement throughout the region of southeastern Colorado by providing incentives and support to attract 19 junior and senior mathematics majors and 9 STEM professionals to the teaching profession.  A long-standing and highly effective collaboration among faculty in the Departments of Mathematics/Physics and Teacher Education at CSU-Pueblo, faculty at 4 area community colleges, 2 local school districts, and 5 community partners is providing the Noyce Scholars and STEM professionals with the strong content and pedagogical training required to teach in high needs schools, and to be retained in the teaching profession beyond their obligatory service period.\r\n\r\nCSU-Pueblo, the only federally designated Hispanic serving university in Colorado, is providing the majority of teachers to its service area. Many school districts and communities within this service area are facing substantial challenges, including low levels of family income and education, historically poor achievement, and graduation rates that lag behind those in other parts of the state.  The enhanced mathematics education in the 7-12 classrooms in this service area is providing underserved students the opportunity to have academic success and to find a rewarding career in a STEM area.",
