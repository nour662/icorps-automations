 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project is a collaborative effort that concentrates on a subtopic within the field of surface engineering. The plan is to conduct a systematic investigation of how the fracture toughness of the interface between a ceramic coating and a substrate depends on the structure and chemistry of the interface region. The plan combines coating/interfacial layer synthesis, atomic-level structural/chemical characterization, and quantitative interfacial fracture toughness measurements. Such a detailed materials/mechanics study on how the structure and chemistry of the interfacial region impact its fracture resistance is the key to establishing quantitative materials design criteria for coating/substrate interfaces in specific applications.  Modifying the near-surface mechanical/chemical properties by applying coatings is important to applications in the traditional machinery and transportation industries and to the emerging micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) industries. Correct applications of coatings enable macro/micro scale mechanical systems and manufacturing techniques to perform beyond their current envelopes. A better understanding of the failure of coated systems is critical to the future success of \"old\" (e.g., machinery and transportation) and \"new\" (e.g., MEMS) industries.  This GOALI project builds on significant past and ongoing research on the synthesis and structural/chemical characterization of coating/interface/substrate systems, novel mechanical property characterization of layered materials, and in particular, their interfaces. The participation of the industrial partner offers added expertise in tribological testing of coated components, and establishes a firm connection between interfacial mechanical properties and performance under engineering contact conditions.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration is interdisciplinary, and promises enhanced educational opportunities for students. Existing educational collaborations offer opportunities for minority students to be informed of and involved in cutting-edge research, and advance NSF's goals in both research and education.",
