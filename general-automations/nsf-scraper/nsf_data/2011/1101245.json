 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Award focuses on the terrestrial and\r\naquatic ecosystem services in New Hampshire and their interactions with short and long\r\nterm changes in climate and land use. The project will investigate the\r\ninterdependence of ecosystems, climate change, and impacts on society. The work is\r\nscientifically significant and regionally relevant as ecosystem services are central to the\r\nwell-being of New Hampshire residents and to the region's economy. The project\r\nbrings together research universities, 2- and 4-year colleges, small businesses, local\r\ngovernment, and non-profit organizations to address key issues related to ecosystems\r\nresearch, education, and workforce development in the state.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis RII project will examine how climate variability and climate change affect and are\r\naffected by changes in land use, supply and demand balances of water resources, and\r\ndynamics of nutrients in New Hampshire's streams and rivers. The research program\r\nwill build a statewide system of terrestrial and aquatic sensors as well as use aircraft\r\nremote sensing and satellite imagery. This infrastructure will provide information on\r\nforest structure, soil emission, water temperature, and nutrient levels with high spatial\r\nand temporal resolution than is currently possible. The new data will be used in\r\nclimate, hydrological, and ecosystem models. The integration of observational and\r\nmodeling work on forest and water ecosystems will lead the way to examine future\r\nscenarios of climate change and the potential impacts on ecosystem function. The\r\nproject will survey public perceptions of climate change and land use and broadly\r\ndisseminate the analyzed results to improve communication among the public, policy\r\nmakers, and an interdisciplinary team of scientists.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe project has a suite of activities that are well-integrated with research to promote\r\neducation at all levels. The implementation of the research project will contribute to an\r\nimproved understanding of the historical effects of climate, land use, and demographic\r\nchanges. In addition, improved communication among researchers, policy makers, and\r\nthe public is expected to enable informed decision-making by all stakeholders.\r\nWorkforce development initiatives under this project include incentives to transfer from\r\n2-year to 4-year schools, and summer institutes for K-12 teachers, 2-year college\r\nfaculty, and 4-H volunteers to be trained in the use of terrestrial and aquatic sensors,\r\ndata collection methods and participation in research. The project includes distance\r\nlearning programs and plans for web-based dissemination of research results.",
