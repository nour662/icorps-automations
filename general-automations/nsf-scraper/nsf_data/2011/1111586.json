 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Himalaya?Tibet orogenic system has been the subject of extensive research for decades, and continues to be a fruitful laboratory for understanding orogenic processes and continental evolution. Geological and geophysical studies have provided important insights into the structure and dynamics of the modern system, but imparted less information about the orogen?s early development, and the characteristics of the colliding continents that may affect subsequent evolution.  The goal of this project is to investigate how crustal and lithospheric thickness changes in southern Tibet in order to establish the ?boundary conditions? for the India-Eurasia collision (~50 My ago) and how lithosphereic thickness changes during and after collision.  As pointed out by the PIs, lithospheric thickness defines the thermal state and rheology of the crust and lithosphere, which are important boundary conditions and properties necessary for understanding the nature of crustal and lithospheric deformation during collision.\r\n\r\nThe PIs will integrate geochemistry, geochronology, paleoelevation, seismology, tectonics, and modeling to understand the pre-collision structure and evolution of the leading edge of the southern Asian continental margin ? the Lhasa block ? and its role in controlling the development of the broader orogen.  They seek to answer two sets of related questions:\r\n\r\n?\tHow has the crustal thickness of the Lhasa block evolved from collision to the present?\r\n?\tHow have the elevation and denudation histories changed through time?\r\n?\tWhat role does metamorphism play in altering crustal rheology and density and as a consequence   facilitate surface uplift and erosion?\r\n?\tWhat is the contribution of lithospheric deformation to thickening of the region?\r\n\r\nThis set of questions is relevant because of the way crustal thickness and surface elevation can influence the mechanics of an orogen.\r\n\r\nThe second set of related questions addresses the later evolution of the Lhasa block:\r\n\r\n?\tWhat is the origin of post-collisional magmas?\r\n?\tTo what extent has melting contributed to crustal weakening and flow?\r\n?\tHow have magmatic and aqueous fluids and lateral heterogeneity in their distribution influenced evolution and deformation of the Lhasa block?\r\n?\tWhy are elevations in the Lhasa block relatively uniform despite considerable variations in geology, exhumation, and deep structure?\r\n\r\nThe importance of these questions derives from the control that rheology and its spatial\r\nvariations play in determining how orogens deform at large and small scales.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSecuring the primary resources needed for our society to function is fundamental to the wellbeing of the United States.  An important component of these needs are resources derived from the Earth, ranging from the copper needed to build and maintain our electric grid to the rare earths needed for high capacity batteries.  The vast majority of these elements are scattered at low concentrations in rocks that would be prohibitively expensive to extract in useful quantities.  Fortunately, in rare cases, natural mechanisms tend to concentrate these elements such that they can be economically harvested.  Virtually all these mechanisms are manifestations of plate tectonics &ndash; the process by which the Earth?s deep stores of energy are brought to the surface to drive interactions between the dozen or so major \"plates\" on our planet.  It is these interactions that drive element concentration to create orebodies.  While we well understand how plate tectonics works in the ocean basins, the interaction of continental plates is far more complex and is poorly understood.   \n\nThe best opportunity to learn about these processes, which can then direct mineral exploration efforts, is from investigations of the Tibetan-Himalayan mountain ranges which were created when India, once an island continent in the Indian Ocean, collided with southern Asia beginning 55 million years ago.  It is this ongoing collision that drove the rise of the Tibetan-Himalayan mountain system which is so large that we think something like this extent of elevated crust has only been seen on the planet perhaps four times in Earth history.  Thus, knowing how plate tectonics accomplished this rare feat is key to understanding how plate tectonics operates when it comes ashore.\n\nThe two classic tectonic models for the Tibetan-Himalayan orogen &ndash; a pure thickening history and one involving pre-collisional mountains and crust that extruded out of the way of India?s impact &ndash; were formulated over 30 years ago yet no clear test has been devised to select between them.  That these models imply vastly different crustal thickness histories (the pure thickening model implies thin crust initially and the extrusion model thick crust) underscores how little we know about it. Our goal in this grant was to develop a large analytical database to find out how the mineral zircon grew in the magmas produced by subduction of the ocean floor that once separated India and Asia.  If the zircons show little isotopic evidence that Asian crust melted when those magmas intruded, it means that the crust must have been relatively cold, and thus thin (less than, say, 20 km thick).  If the zircons instead show that Asian crust was widely assimilated into these magmas, then this is evidence that the crust  was thick. \n\nWe find that crustal thickness in southernmost Tibet was relatively thin (&lt;20 km) from 200 million years to immediately prior to the onset of the Indo-Asian collision, which is supportive of the extrusion model.  This observation reinforces the growing view that Tibet hosted significant topography prior to collision.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: T. Mark Harrison"
