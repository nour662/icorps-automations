 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although neurons receive most of the attention in brain research, a second cell type, glial cells, comprise as many or more of the cells in the brain.  Astrocytes are a major type of glial cell.  These cells function to regulate brain metabolism, including the energy use of neurons.  Past findings from this laboratory and others indicate that glucose provision to the brain enhances memory functions.   Adult mammalian brains use glucose as the major source of energy.  This project will determine whether and how astrocytes regulate memory formation by controlling energy use in the brain.  The general hypothesis is that ECF glucose levels are sufficient to meet energy requirements under low-need conditions.  But when the need is greater, for example during activation to support more intense cognitive functions, astrocytes break down energy reserves stores to provide neurons with a rapid energy boost.  These experiments use new methods to measure brain energy substances in awake rats during memory testing, together with pharmacological treatments that identify the necessity of different metabolic routes during memory processing.   The role of brain energy metabolism in making new memories identifies a new set of biological processes that regulate the highest functions of the brain, opening new avenues for investigation of brain processes with potentially high impact in scientific investigations of the brain and its functions.  In addition to the scientific impact, the project will have direct impact on science education and training at the postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate and K-12 level.  The PI has mentored students at all these levels and, relatively uniquely, includes high school students in the research team.  The PI will bring information from this research project to the public through regular participation in outreach programs to secondary school students and education forums for the elderly.",
