 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large igneous provinces, like the Snake River Plain in Washington State or the Deccan Traps of India, represent huge outpourings of basalt from the mantle and are prominent geologic features of the land and seafloor.  Due to their immense size and the vast amount of reduced fluids and other volatiles they release upon eruption, these eruptive sequences have major impacts on local and global environmental and atmospheric conditions.  The Ontong Java Plateau in the Pacific Ocean is one of these provinces and was erupted almost entirely underwater where it affected global ocean chemistry.  This research develops novel new methods for determining the length, volume, duration, style, and depth of lava flow emplacement at Ontong Java.  Samples of basaltic glasses from cores collected by the Ocean Drilling Program will be analyzed for volatile species (Cl, S, H2O, CO2) by very precise electron microprobe, FTIR, and laser ablation ICPMS.  Major and trace elements will also be analyzed.  Statistical methods will be used to determine if different samples are from the same flow field and/or eruption.  Samples both within and between drill holes will be compared.  Goals are to determine if individual lava flows can be traced hundreds of kilometers and to use this information to constrain lava flow size and emplacement rates.  The broader impacts of the work include a large service-learning component that will engage undergraduates with K-12 students, as well as carry out an innovative simulated oceanographic voyage that will integrate research and education and impact over 100 undergraduates.  In terms of other workforce development, a graduate student will be trained and students will be taken to professional society meetings to present the results of their work.  Additional impacts include the fact that funds will be provided to an institution in an EPSCoR state (Oklahoma), international collaboration with German scientists, and the interlaboratory calibration of volatile data.  Results of the work are complementary to those of the NSF-funded Ocean Drilling Program.",

We think that we have documented a lava flow on Ontong Java Plateau that is the largest submarine lava flow on Earth, and the most homogeneous lava flow known on our planet. Understanding the size of lava flows will help us to relate the size of eruptions to their impact on Earth?s climate and oceans. \n\nBackground: Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) in the Pacific Ocean is a submarine plateau that was formed by Earth?s largest igneous event about 120 million years ago, when basaltic lavas poured onto the seafloor.  OJP has the same surface area and crustal thickness as Alaska.  It currently rises about 2000 meters above the surrounding seafloor and is composed of basaltic lava flows that have been covered by hundreds of meters of sediments that have accumulated since the eruptions stopped. OJP is Earth?s largest large igneous province (LIP), and is similar to flood basalt provinces on land, such as the Columbia River Basalts in Washington State, where mapped lava flows are 100s of cubic kilometers.  LIPs form rapidly, which requires that the rate of lava output is very high. But we are not sure if OJP formed over a period of several million years by many small eruptions, or if there were very large eruptions.  OJP?s submarine nature and thick sediment cover make it impossible to map lava flows there.   The goal of this project is to use the geochemical composition of basalts to deduce the size of lava flows, eruptions, and magma chambers that were present when OJP was forming.  We are fortunate to have basalt samples from eight drill holes on the immense plateau that were recovered by the international scientific ocean drilling programs (ODP).  We determined very precisely the chemical composition of natural basalt glasses that formed when lava encountered seawater. The glasses represent the liquid composition of the magma.  We assume that if basalt glasses from distant sites have precisely the same composition, including Chlorine contents that are a late addition to the magma chamber, then the lavas were erupted at the same time from the same magma chamber and are from the same lava flow.   \n\nFindings:  We found that basalt glasses from Sites 1185B and 1186A (Figure 1) are identical in major element, trace element and volatile concentration with a very high degree of precision.  The two sites (Fig. 2) are separated by 220 km!  The homogeneity of this lava flow over such great distances is perhaps the most extreme ever observed for a lava flow.  It requires that the more distant parts of the eruption flowed with virtually no loss of heat to the cold ocean above. The lavas must have been extremely well insulated by an overlying crust, and perhaps flowed in lava tubes.\n\nSubmarine basalt lavas are almost always oversaturated with CO2 when they ascend and erupt. The CO2 separate from the liquid and forms vesicles (bubbles) that eventually float out of the liquid lava, much like when a carbonated beverage is opened and goes flat.  Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) always retain some vesicles because they do not remain molten long enough after eruption for all bubbles to leave the lava. In sharp contrast, there are no vesicles left in any of the glasses from OJP, suggesting that they remained liquid for a much longer time than MORB and lost all of their bubbles.  Moreover, all of the glasses from 1185B and 1186A have the same dissolved CO2 content showing that they equilibrated (\"became flat\") at the same pressure and water depth, even though basalts in 1185B solidified at a depth that was 700 meters deeper than 1186A.  This means that basalts at site 1185B must have flowed at least 220 km farther than those from 1186A, to water that was 700 meters deeper.\n\nIn summary, our analyses and observations make us confident that the lava flows recovered in both holes issued from the same magma chamber, and possibly from the same eruptive vents.
