 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the principal investigator and his assistants are working on a framework for achieving\r\nscalability and sustainability in three-dimensional wireless sensor network deployments. The objective is\r\nto study the design of energy-efficient three-dimensional k-covered wireless sensor networks, where each\r\npoint in a field of interest is covered by at least k heterogeneous sensors, in the presence of obstacles\r\nand mobile events in the field. This study is based on Baxter's factorization of Ornstein-Zernike equation,\r\nthe pair-connectedness theory, and potential fields to solve the problem of joint k-coverage, duty-cycling,\r\nand data forwarding in three-dimensional heterogeneous wireless sensor networks with a goal to achieve\r\nsustainable and scalable deployments. The principal investigator plans to evaluate the performance of this\r\nframework through simulation using a network simulator, such as TOSSIM, and implementation using a test-bed of sensors, such as MICAz motes.\r\n\r\nThis project has significant impact on its field and the society. It has a rich plan for the integration\r\nof research and education through the development of curriculum and resources for teaching to a wide range of undergraduate and graduate students. Based on the results of this project, the principal investigator plans to develop a set of networking courses. Also, the principal investigator has a plan to recruit, train, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students including women and members of underrepresented minority groups. Furthermore, this project allows the principal investigator mentor K-12 teachers and high-school students through research seminars. It helps the principal investigator attract and recruit students to pursue science careers.",
