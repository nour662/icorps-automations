 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding to set up a multiuser general-purpose molecular laboratory to be used by in house staff, visiting scientists, students and educational groups at Motes Tropical Research Laboratory (TRL) located in the Florida Keys. The addition of molecular equipment to Motes Tropical Research Laboratory will support research across numerous cross disciplines within marine biology including coral genetics, microbiology, immunology, and biomedical research projects currently ongoing at Mote Marine Laboratory.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe TFL facility is used extensively especially by visiting scientists. In 2009, over 55 Universities, Colleges and/or Agencies have operated courses or workshops out of this facility. As part of MML's NSF funded REU program, students from underrepresented groups (Native Pacific Islanders) have participated in marine science research projects for the past eight years. Visiting scientists will be able to use the equipment at this southernmost marine lab in the continental US. The PIs have a policy in place for assuring access to outside users. Summer courses will use the equipment. Mote has intensive student internships. The PI Matz (from UT, A) ran a workshop in 2009 teaching qPCR analysis for marine biologists.",
