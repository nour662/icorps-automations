These scholarships, together with well-established infrastructure and student-centered programs, including a community-of-mentors, are to enable participants to stay full-time and to graduate. The program is to help ensure successful transition from upper division work to research, graduate school, academia, and the skilled STEM workforce.  This program builds on 11 current and prior projects (850 scholarships to date), which have had a retention rate of 98.3% with over 50% of the graduates going on to graduate school full-time. The project is to continue and expand the services available to students of diverse gender, ethnic, social, and economic backgrounds, clearly supporting the university's commitment to provide a high quality education to all students. It is to also introduce students to exciting new research developments spanning all STEM disciplines and encourage them to earn a technical graduate degree.",

It is much more difficult to ensure success with modest scholarships given to as many academically-talented students as possible, especially if these students are at risk, such as first generation, underrepresented minority, or female, and all with unmet financial need. In addition to the challenge of the academics, these students may not have natural mentors at home, may have to work (even with a scholarship), and may lack confidence to ask for help.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The major goal of this project was to provide $4K scholarships per year to academically-talented, financially-disadvantaged, upper division and graduate engineering and computer science students, especially female and underrepresented minority students. We successfully carried out this goal by awarding 495 $2K scholarships to 120 students over the course of the project. NSF grant (1060226) scholarships were supplemented by a $119,999 NSF scholarship grant through the Hispanic Scholarship Investment program and a $100,000 grant from the Arizona State University&rsquo;s Women &amp; Philanthropy Organization. During semesters in which we had more qualified applicants than available full scholarships, we awarded $300 scholarships to these applicants, who also participated in the program.&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scholarship students enrolled in an Academic Success and Professional Development Program (ASAP) each semester to maximize their success in the academic and work worlds.&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Our goal was to include at least 60% underrepresented minority and female students. Seventy-four of the 120 scholars (</strong><strong>61.6%</strong><strong>) were in this category. All scholarship students had unmet financial need.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"Success\" was to graduate at least 90% of the scholarship students and to have at least 50% (more than double the national rate) of the students earning a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree continue right on to a full-time graduate program. The only graduate students given a scholarship through this program were those who had been in the program and ASAP class as undergraduates. In fact, we retained 91 of 92 (</strong><strong>98.9%</strong><strong>) of the upper division undergraduate students (compared to a 70-80% national rate for such students) and graduated 59 of 62 (</strong><strong>95.2%</strong><strong>) of the graduate students. To date, 34 of the 56 students (</strong><strong>60.7%</strong><strong>) who have graduated went right on to graduate school.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This program became a national model for successful S-STEM Scholarship programs. We were the first program to include graduate students, develop a highly successful required 2 credit ASAP class, use $300 scholarships to include more students, and to use the &ldquo;Guaranteed 4.0 Plan&rdquo; Learning System by Donna O. Johnson Mackey as the academic foundation to help students get at least a 3.5 GPA which allowed them to do a 4+1 program to complete Bachelor&rsquo;s and Master&rsquo;s degree in five years. The graduate students made excellent role models and mentors for the undergraduate students, helped with meetings, and did a related book report each semester. The scholarship students were invited to use the special student center for transfers which was operated through an NSF STEP grant (0856834). The ASAP class was open to all upper division engineering and computer science students. Typically, half of the class were non-scholarship students: most attended due to positive word-of-mouth. Some joined upon the recommendation of their advisor to help with their low GPA. Although the ASAP class was not a remedial course, we were happy to help all students who joined the class. Light refreshments were served at each meeting to help keep a positive atmosphere.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The specific goal, to graduate the students well, was accomplished through the ASAP class. In additional to learning skills, the students were taught professional skills not normally learned in the classroom. Throughout the grant, we immersed the students in a well-established infrastructure and student-centered program including mentors who encouraged the students to stay full-time, to graduate, and to go on to graduate school.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Another objective of the project was to do research and to publish our results on how to best work with students outside of the classroom to make them successful. We produced numerous publications (15 refereed papers, 7 major workshops, 3 years of Newsletters, and a website, </strong><a href=\"https://www.asu.engineering.mets.edu/\"><strong>https://www.asu.engineering.mets.edu</strong></a><strong>). </strong></p>\n<p><strong>The ASAP course met eight times/semester (75 minutes/meeting). Each class was held four times to allow flexibility in scheduling for the students and to keep the meetings small and informal. The PI also met with each student in the ASAP class individually for at least 30 minutes at least once each semester.
