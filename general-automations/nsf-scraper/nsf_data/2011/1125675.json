But, many questions remain concerning its foundations. In particular, the heart of quantum mechanics is entanglement but, as emphasized by Feynman, among others, its nature essentially remains unknown .Thus, a strong effort will be made to understand it more deeply.\r\n\r\nBroader Benefits: Ironically, entanglement is a tool which is essentially used in all modern quantum systems, despite being poorly understood. Thus, greater knowledge of its fundamental characterestics should  have significant impact on the design of future information systems with clear economic and social impact. Its study will present a very interesting attraction and challenge to graduate students and should be a great stimulus in course discussions. Attempts will also be made to interest students , not only at LSU, but also at Southern University (an HBCU).",
