Ensembles of freely diffusing colloids will be employed as ultra-sensitive probes to\r\nmeasure energy vs. separation dependent protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate potentials of mean\r\nforce (PMF) between proteins/carbohydrates attached to colloids and planar surfaces. By using\r\nevanescent wave and video microscopy, DCPM will monitor three dimensional Brownian excursions of\r\nprotein decorated colloids near homogeneous, heterogeneous, and patterned substrates with covalently\r\nattached and oriented proteins/carbohydrates. Because diffusing probes sample spatial positions according\r\nto their relative energies, statistical mechanical analyses of diffusing probes can be interpreted as net\r\nPMFs including superimposable non-specific (colloidal, macromolecular) and specific (residues,\r\nconformational) contributions. DCPM will interrogate protein and carbohydrate interactions by exploiting\r\nnatural gauges accessible with diffusing colloidal probes including Brownian time scales (a2 /D), thermal\r\nenergies (kT), and molecular length scales (nm) (and hence weak forces (~fN)).\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research is related to the fundamental and technological\r\ninsights that will be gained into immobilized protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions.\r\nSpecific biomolecular interactions to be investigated include: (1) Ca2+ dependent homophilic and\r\nheterophilic cadherin interactions on supported lipid bilayers, (2) CD44-hyaluronic acid (HA) interactions\r\nin the presence of competing oligosaccharides. Cadherins are transmembrane proteins whose interactions\r\nplay a critical role in determining cell adhesion in cellular processes including for example tissue\r\nmorphogenesis, synaptic plasticity, apoptosis, and cancer metastasis. CD44 is the main cell surface\r\nsignaling receptor for HA, which is an extracellular matrix component. As a result, CD44-HA interactions\r\nregulate cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, morphogenesis, cell proliferation, cell signaling via regulation\r\nof gene expression and RNA splicing, cell differentiation, and metastasis. Ultimately, measuring how\r\nimmobilized cadherin-cadherin and CD44-HA interactions are influenced by physical, chemical, and\r\nbiochemical variables is important to understanding fundamental biology and biomedical applications.\r\nThe first task of the proposed work is to covalently attach/orient proteins and carbohydrates onto\r\nsilica colloids and surfaces either with or without supported lipid bilayers. To allow for deconvolution of\r\nnon-specific and specific contributions to net potentials, the second task is to measure how the\r\ninteractions of covalently attached/oriented carbohydrates and proteins are influenced by varying solution\r\nchemistries (e.g. ions, small molecules), physical configuration (e.g. orientation, spatial organization),\r\ncompetitive interactions (e.g. antibodies, monosaccharides), and biochemical variations (e.g. different\r\ntypes, mutations). The last task is to measure non-specific and specific interactions on model arrays\r\nconsisting of patterned regions of carbohydrates or covalently attached/oriented proteins. Successful\r\ncompletion of proposed objectives will demonstrate a conceptually new approach to directly and\r\nsensitively quantify kT-scale non-specific and specific interactions that control non-covalent, equilibrium\r\nbinding of proteins and carbohydrates immobilized on particles and surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed research include scientific and technological outcomes as\r\nwell as integrated education and outreach activities. The ability to directly and sensitively measure weak\r\ninteractions between proteins and carbohydrate on synthetic material surfaces provides information to\r\nenable many biomedical applications involving diagnostics, devices, therapeutics, drug delivery, and\r\ntissue engineering. Such understanding provides a basis to quantitatively design, control, and optimize\r\n(formally engineer) the properties and behavior of immobilized proteins and carbohydrates in biomedical\r\napplications and provide new insights beyond what is known from trial-and-error discovery. In terms of\r\neducation, research images/videos will be incorporated into undergraduate thermo and graduate\r\ncolloid/polymer elective courses and execution of the proposed research will involve training\r\nundergraduate and graduate students. In terms of outreach, content involving optical microscopy of\r\ncolloids will be adapted for use in programs for 7-12 students and public museum presentations.",
