 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discover STEM-Generation Innovation project at Owensboro Community & Technical College (OCTC) is based on a prior NSF-supported project. OCTC is developing a comprehensive recruitment and retention model to increase the number of students, particularly underrepresented groups including females, minorities, and disabled populations, exposed to STEM education and careers, and is promoting technician education in Kentucky. The current project is a scale-up project. STEM pathways in advanced manufacturing, mechatronics, engineering, biotechnology, and information technology are being developed throughout Kentucky by collaborating with five mentee sites located at two-year colleges across the state.  Middle and high school students are attracted to STEM activities using clubs, academies and robotic competitions with the intent that at least 70% of these students will transition to enrollment in college. Professional development offerings for 200 teachers expose them to the importance of technician education and help them to teach and support the K-12 students. Industry involvement in the professional development efforts for faculty and teachers is an important added feature. Evaluative activities are informing both the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS) and the community college STEM system at large about the important features essential to fidelity of implementation and quality scale-up efforts.",
