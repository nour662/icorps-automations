 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Thomas Jones of the College of Saint Benedict, for the synthesis, characterization and evaluation of multifunctional dendritic cascade catalysts.  The goal of this work is to attach both metal and organometallic catalysts to the perimeter of G4 poly(amido amine) dendrimers, and to make subsequent kinetic and mechanistic studies in regard to catalyst optimization.  Cascade catalysts are important for the development of multi-step, one-pot reactions in organic chemistry.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the research are based on the general development of \"atom economical\" reactions, which are critical for the reduction of the waste stream in the chemical industry and can save time during labor intensive pharmaceutical multistep syntheses. The research by Professor Jones, in collaboration with Professor Cloninger at Montana State University, is geared to the training of undergraduate researchers in synthesis, characterization by a variety of analytical methods, and mechanistic and kinetic measurements.",
