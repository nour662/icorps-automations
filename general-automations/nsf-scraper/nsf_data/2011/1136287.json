This workshop has two main objectives. First, to bring together a group of US researchers and their foreign counterparts to identify current challenges, future rewarding research directions, priorities and approaches and to provide opportunities for collaboration on specific fields where advances in nanomanufacturing have the promise for an immense impact, namely: (i) Current Nano Challenges; (ii) Environmental Implications; (iii) Energy Conversion and Storage; (iv) Biotechnology; and (v) Large Scale Nanomanufacturing, Innovation and Commercialization.  The second objective is to provide a unique opportunity for several US graduate students to gain international research experience, meet, discuss and present their work via poster presentations, be exposed to an interdisciplinary environment and offer potentially high benefits through collaboration with investigators abroad. The preliminary list of invitees/participants includes world leaders and renowned researchers from the US, Europe, the region (Greece) and around the world who are in the scientific forefront of nanoscience and nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis workshop provides an excellent venue and environment for the exchange of ideas and open discussions that allow for the presentation of the researchers? latest work, augmenting efforts to advance the research frontiers in this field via international collaborations.  The workshop will provide a significant opportunity for human resource development and graduate education, training and exposure to an interdisciplinary international environment.  An elite volume will be compiled in electronic format with all invited presentations and posters presented by the students. In addition, participants can submit manuscripts based on their presentations for consideration for publication to a number of reputable referred journals.  Special efforts will be devoted to make the workshop available for underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities. Underrepresented minorities will also be pursued through interaction with the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers (housed on UTA campus).",
