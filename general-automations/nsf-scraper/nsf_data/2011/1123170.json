 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Collaborative Research Proposal: Maplets for Calculus is a student oriented electronic study guide collection of over one hundred applets for precalculus, single and multivariable calculus. These highly pedagogical applets balance the development of understanding and technical skills by posing questions, guiding the student through the solution process, checking intermediate results, and providing timely hints.  Instructors use the applets as lecture demonstrations, as a source for quiz questions, or in a lab setting where students can talk to each other about solving them.  Users access an endless supply of randomly generated questions or enter their own problems.  The applets enhance comprehension through many 2-D and 3-D graphics and animations.  Students have been instrumental throughout the development of this project: initial development of many applets was done by Honors calculus students; the web interface for the project was designed by a high school student; and the adaptation to mobile devices is done by a staff of undergraduates.  A Ph.D. student in secondary education is studying the use of Maplets for Calculus with high school students in precalculus and calculus courses. \r\n\r\nDuring the initial CCLI project the number of applets grew from 70 to 129, and the collection is growing to over 200 under the current TUES funding. User ratings have been incorporated for each applet, and surveys are being developed and administered at several universities to assess the effectiveness of the applets.  The results from ratings and surveys are being used to improve the effectiveness of the applets, and the applets are being adapted to mobile devices, incorporating them into on-line texts and translating them into other languages. General software tools and techniques for creating the interface for mobile devices will remain in the public domain, whereas the pedagogical materials must be purchased as individual or site licenses at MYMathApps.com.  Dissemination efforts, including publications, presentations, workshops and sales, will ensure sustainability.",

(See Figure 1.)</p>\n<p>What is a &ldquo;Maplet&rdquo;?&nbsp; On a technical level, a Maplet is a standalone Java applet written in the Maple programming language.&nbsp; One advantage of using Maple is that, as a computer algebra system (CAS), mathematical objects are entered, dissected, graphed, and manipulated as mathematical objects, not as text strings or collection of points. &nbsp;Benefits of using a CAS include (1) problems can be randomly generated in a sophisticated manner with corresponding hints and responses to students' incorrect answers and (2) student responses can be accepted as correct when they are mathematically equivalent to the correct answer even if they are not presented in exactly the same way.</p>\n<p>Each of the more than 200 Maplets in Maplets for Calculus (M4C) presents a problem in a pedagogically-designed user interface that provides an interactive step-by-step solution to typical calculus (and precalculus) problems.&nbsp; The interfaces include 2-d and 3-d graphics and animations to reinforce conceptual understanding (see Figure 2). The M4C are designed for multiple uses: interactive study guide, automatically graded homework or quiz, lab exploration, and lecture demonstration.</p>\n<p>The specific problems in each Maplet are generated algorithmically, making it extremely unlikely that the same problem will ever be seen more than once.&nbsp; The algorithmic generation of problems (with many more parameters than most commercial learning management systems) ensures that students master the concepts more than simply memorizing specific steps or answers.</p>\n<p>One of the most important features of the M4C is that they do not just ask for a final answer, each step must be answered before the next step, and each step is evaluated in the context of previous steps.&nbsp; The M4C detect, and respond appropriately, for many typical errors.&nbsp; For example, in indefinite integrals, when a response is missing a differential or constant of integration, the M4C responds with a gentle warning about the student&rsquo;s mistake before moving on to the next step.&nbsp; (See Figure 3.)</p>\n<p>While some of these details are relatively minor, the fact that student responses are evaluated mathematically without requiring a specific notation or format is appreciated by the students.&nbsp; The PIs have been careful and intentional about incorporating this type of pedagogical intelligence into each of the Maplets.</p>\n<p>The origins of the M4C date back to independent work done by the PIs in the early 1990&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Their partnership started in 2002, and the first set of 37 Maplets for Calculus was released in 2005.&nbsp; NSF support started in June 2008 with parallel CCLI Phase I grants.&nbsp; This support was used to expand the collection to more than 100 Maplets.&nbsp; The current collaborative TUES Type 2 awards began in August 2011 with three primary goals:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;i. to enhance and expand the collection to around 200 topics,<br />&nbsp; ii. to assess the effectiveness of the Maplets, and<br />&nbsp;iii. to begin to incorporate M4C into other pedagogical materials such as textbooks.</p>\n<ol> </ol>\n<p>The new Maplets completed the coverage of major topics in single variable calculus (Calculus I and II) with additional coverage of precalculus and multivariable calculus topics.&nbsp; The enhancements of existing Maplets address both appearance and function.&nbsp; Each Maplet has a consistent look-and-feel, with appropriate and consistent hints.&nbsp; The functional enhancements allow the Maplets to be used for more educational purposes (including graded assignments) and on as wide a range of hardware platforms as possible.</p>\n<p>The majority of the assessment was done by surveys and other student feedback.&nbsp; There is a strong consensus that the hints and detailed feedback are beneficial to learning.&nbsp; In addition, while most students do not particularly enjoy the laboratory component of their calculus course, they prefer labs that use the M4C more than those involving direct use of Maple or MATLAB.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A common student complaint is that the M4C can be used only on devices on which Maple is supported.&nbsp; While the M4C (and a suitable version of Maple&rsquo;s MapletPlayer) are available at a nominal cost at MYMathApps.com, the Java requirement excludes the use of M4C on mobile devices.&nbsp; The PIs have developed prototypical versions of several Maplets in Javascript and HTML5, with the computer algebra provided via Sage and continue to search for better technologies to bring the M4C to tablets and other mobile devices.&nbsp; There was not enough time (or resources) in the current grant to achieve a complete conversion.&nbsp; The time spent on these investigations and prototypes has replaced some of the originally-planned dissemination. &nbsp;Each PI is involved in separate calculus &ldquo;textbook&rdquo; projects that should ultimately lead to a fully electronic and interactive calculus book that incorporates many of the pedagogical advances found in the Maplets for Calculus. &nbsp;This will certainly be the focus of the PIs&rsquo;
