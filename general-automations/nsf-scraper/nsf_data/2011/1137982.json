 "awd_abstract_narration": "MacNeil Lehrer Productions, producer of the PBS NewsHour, is awarded a RAPID grant to cover the research that is ongoing as a result of the unanticipated and disastrous earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan.  The team of experienced producers and correspondents will produce at least 8 segments for broadcast, along with extensive material for online.  All the stories will revolve around scientists (geophysicists, oceanographers) and engineers (structural, seismic, civic, nuclear) as well as social scientists and the work they are doing in wake of the disaster. \r\n \r\nThe online material will include blogs and web-only video reports that will deliver content to augment broadcast coverage.  The coverage will include not only what is being learned in Japan but how that knowledge will impact earthquake, tsunami and nuclear engineering and science, as well as social impact studies, in the United States. The NewsHour will encourage user engagement through regular posting of stories on social media outlets, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, UStream and Discus.  The online/on-air correspondent Hari Sreenivasan will conduct web-exclusive interviews with scientists on the forefront of the related research.  The NewsHour Extra, the website that reaches 170,000 educators per month, will use the science coverage on its Daily Video Clip Tool to provide educators resources and lesson plans to help initiate discussions with students about the science, environmental and engineering issues raised by the on-going story.\r\n\r\nThe reach of the PBS NewsHour is significant.  PBS NewsHour is seen five nights a week on more than 315 PBS stations across the country and is also available online, via public radio in select markets and via podcast.  The national daily broadcast delivers an audience of approximately 1.1 million viewers and the Online NewsHour visitors reached 5.4+ million monthly page views in January 2011. The NewsHour public radio broadcasts reach an average of 63 thousand listeners daily across the U.S.  Outside the U.S., the PBS NewsHour television broadcast is available on the American Forces Television to more than 800,000 U.S. military and State Department personnel around the world.  In addition, audiences across Canada, Australia, Japan and Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America tune into the service via various channels and satellite services.  The deliverables produced under this award will be consolidated on the NewsHour website where they will create a permanent record of these resources.",
