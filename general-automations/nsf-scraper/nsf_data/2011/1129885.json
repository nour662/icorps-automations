The workshop is framed around the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges, particularly in regards to the environment and sustainable processes.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop will draw from both practicing engineers, professional societies, and engineering educators, and help create a broad network to address learning and teaching in this dynamic field.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.",
