 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on correcting common student misconceptions about fundamental concepts in dynamics courses through active inductive learning.  Four primary aspects of the project include: 1) the development and testing of prototype inquiry-based, hands-on educational materials to teach engineering concepts in dynamics; 2) utilizing the Dynamics Concept Inventory and other short conceptual questions to assess the effectiveness of interventions; 3) analyzing the process of student learning through talk-aloud exercises and recordings of students conducting the activities; and 4) disseminating the prototype activities and assessment results to the engineering community.  The inquiry-based learning activities will be easy to use, inexpensive, well-publicized, and disseminated through a variety of mechanisms, including traditional publications and presentations as well as web-based activities.  The inquiry-based approach incorporates elements (e.g., collaborative learning) that are intended to improve the retention of underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs. Subjective surveys and analysis of the talk-aloud activities will help determine the effectiveness of the inquiry-based learning activities in these populations.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Our team has created five hands-on inquiry-based learning activities (IBLAs) to engage students in conceptual learning in engineering dynamics. The activities allow the students to experiment with physical objects similar to those they might see in a homework problem, e.g. weights on a pulley, hollow and solid cylinders rolling down a ramp, gyroscopes spinning, and strings wrapped around spools pulled gently across a surface. As depicted in Figure 1, each of the five IBLAs target specific dynamics principles; pictures of students doing the Spool and Rolling Cylinders IBLAs are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. The scenarios in the IBLAs are designed to produce non-intuitive results, resulting in cognitive conflict. In this way, the activities intentionally challenge students to rethink their conceptual frameworks.</p>\n<p>The IBLA follows a series of different physical cases, each of which utilizes a predict-observe-explain cycle as shown in Figure 4. We first ask students to make an individual prediction (often using an online quiz system) about a physical scenario, and then allow them to discuss this prediction in teams of 3-4 members. After recording any changed predictions after their discussion, students then conduct the &ldquo;experiment&rdquo;, allowing the physical world to be the authority instead of the instructor. Following prompts on a team worksheet, students then try to explain what they have observed using the principles of dynamics. Multiple (but similar) scenarios are then presented, often accompanied by instructor explanations and class discussion.</p>\n<p>Students enjoyed using the hands-on artefacts, and reported that the activities were interesting and motivating (see Figure 5). &nbsp;As part of our research, we also performed a cross-over study to compare learning when students were able to experiment with the hands-on artefacts themselves versus when the instructor ran the activity as a demonstration. Although there was no significant difference on targeted questions on the Dynamics Concept Inventory between the Hands-On and Demo versions of the IBLAs, both IBLA groups significantly outperformed class sections taught by instructors who used a more traditional lecture-based approach (see Figure 6). In addition, the students in the IBLA classes outperformed their counterparts on a common final examination that was mostly traditional homework-style workout problems.</p>\n<p>Our team has reported our results in numerous venues, particularly with workshops and conferences presentations/proceedings. We have presented at community college educator meetings, at regional and national meetings of the American Society for Engineering Education, and at international venues such as the Research in Engineering Education Symposium.

Students self-report that these activities are interesting and motivating, and that they help them learn about dynamics. Students learn the concepts targeted in the IBLAs much better than peers in courses that do not use IBLAs, and outperform these counterparts in typical homework style problems as well.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/13/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Brian&nbsp;Self</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1044282/1044282_10115593_1479063370371_RollingcylindersIBLA--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1044282/1044282_10115593_1479063370371_RollingcylindersIBLA--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rolling Cylinders IBLA\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1044282/1044282_10115593_1479063370371_RollingcylindersIBLA--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rolling Cylinders IBLA\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig 3.
