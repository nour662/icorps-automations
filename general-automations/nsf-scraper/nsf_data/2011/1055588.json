 "awd_abstract_narration": "The invertebrate fossil collection at the Florida Museum of Natural History ranks among the ten largest in the nation and is heavily used by scientists and students at all academic levels, receiving over 4,500 online visits per month. During this two-year project, approximately 436,000 specimens will be curated and computer-cataloged into the collection database which is searchable on the internet. These specimens come from two sources: A microfossil collection from the Florida Geological Survey and a collection of macrofossils from Florida and the Carolinas assembled by Dr. Jules DuBar following a half-century of NSF-sponsored fieldwork. Both suites of fossils are in high demand by researchers because over 50 scientific publications are based on them, yet they have been unavailable for study for decades.\r\n\r\nIn addition to professional scientists and university students whose research will benefit from online access to these important specimens, fossil enthusiasts and members of the general public, searching for information for science projects, term papers, photo presentations, etc., using internet search engines will also benefit as this project seriously expands the data available to the public. Museum exhibits, public outreach activities and fossil identification guides will help to make the newly cataloged data accessible to a public that is increasingly thirsty for information about fossils.",

Data and some images from these significant collections were then added to our online database (http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/invertpaleo/) to serve all interested parties (researchers, educators, and the public) worldwide. Furthermore, pertinent data from the largest of the two collections (Dr. Jules DuBar - see below) was provided to the Neogene Atlas of Ancient Life - Southeastern United States (http://www.neogeneatlas.org/) to help populate their popular website which provides ways to explore diversity, geographic distribution, evolution, and paleoecology of fossils that the public might encounter.\n\nThe largest curated collection was that of the late Dr. Jules DuBar and consists of fossil marine invertebrates (snails, clams, sand dollars, etc.) from Florida, North and South Carolina, and Texas that existed during the past 65 million years.  These collections (14,000 lots) were amassed during a half century of fieldwork and were instrumental in helping to define named rock units of these states.  Also, they contain some of the best documented collections from the SE USA.  The smaller collection curated was the Florida Geological Survey microfossil collection (6,500 lots) which represents over 100 years of collecting and study of Florida's fossil-bearing surface and subsurface rocks; including 351 well locations and sites no longer accessible due to rampant land development.  The deep (up to 6,800 feet) well core samples are especially valuable as high drilling costs make it unlikely similar cores will be drilled in the furture.  Together these two collections have been the source of over 50 high-quality scientific publications.  \n\nNow curated, these material are being used to help estimate past regional and global climate change through geochemistry of certain fossils and help determine sea level flucuations and paleoshorelines through time, to contribute to ecological niche modeling of snails and clams over the last 20 million years, and used to produce more accurate geological maps.  \n\nAll funding provided for this curation helped train some of our undergraduate and graduate students, non-student personnel, and  volunteers.  Each learned about invertebrate scientific names, hard-part  anatomy, geography, and geology.  Furthermore instruction of modern  curatoial techniques, specimen conservation, photography, and use of  computer software (e.g., Access and Google Earth) was provided.\n\nThrough evaluating the DuBar Collection and other incoming materials (donations and field collections) made during the grant period, duplicative specimens and fossils with little to no scientific value, were supplied to local and regional elementary and miidle schools, the FLMNH Exhibits and Education Department, and the public to help teach about the diversity of life on Earth, evolution, and how fossils and geology are an important and everday part of their lives (e.g. fossil-rich limestones are used in Florida roads and construction materials like concrete).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/14/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roger W Portell"
