 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific research on interactions between humans and their environments requires a robust understanding of the ethical issues relevant to such interactions. This project is designed to ensure that graduate students in science and engineering have the knowledge and skills needed to address ethical issues in their research. The goals of the project are to create, pilot, and assess seven curricular modules on topics involving human-environment interactions such as biofuels, water quality, genetic modification, environmental toxicity, climate prediction, industrial choices of raw materials, and renewable energy sources. The research will also include the development and assessment of faculty capacity building strategies; this will include training science and engineering faculty to effectively teach these topics, as well as training ethics faculty to partner with science and engineering faculty to implement such curriculum and develop new or revised modules. The curriculum and pedagogy will be piloted, assessed, and implemented at Penn State University, a major research university with top graduate programs in science and engineering, and North Carolina A&T, a premier historically black university and the #1 producer of minority graduates in science and engineering in the U.S. The curriculum will be included within an online research ethics course that will be available to graduate students across the country through Penn State World Campus.  \r\n\r\nThis research will advance discovery of emerging ethical issues in research concerning human-environment interactions and will contribute to the implementation of high quality and topically relevant ethics training for graduate students in the sciences and engineering. The study is also designed to determine how to effectively provide science and engineering faculty with the knowledge and skills needed to incorporate ethics training in their classes. The products of this study will be widely disseminated through faculty workshops, conference presentations, publications, and online distribution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of National Science Foundation Ethics Education in Science and Engineering Grant #1135327, Graduate Pedagogy for Ethical Dimensions of Coupled Natural and Human Systems Research was to create interactive, open-access online modules that provide first year graduate students with an understanding of ethical dimensions of research and practice in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields.  The focus of traditional research ethics training has been responsible conduct of research (RCR) issues.  Such training includes topics such as preventing falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism, good data management strategies, and understanding how to avoid or manage conflicts of interest.  While these are important components of ethics training, we developed what we refer to as an \"expanded understanding\" of ethics in order to indicate that these issues are not the only ones that arise during the process of STEM research. \n\nOur modules offer training in three broad areas of ethics relevant to STEM research.  The first dimension of ethics training encompasses issues of RCR along with additional grey areas and emerging RCR areas.  This component of our training is labeled Research Integrity.  The second dimension of research ethics involves what we call Embedded Ethics.  This important domain examines ethical issues that arise in the course of the practice of science and engineering.  In this dimension, we also look at coupled ethical-epistemic analyses.  These involve attention to the ways in which ethical issues (concerning how we should act, or the impacts of choices of actions on others) are interconnected to epistemic issues (what we choose to study, what we overlook, how we frame what we desire to know).  The third dimension is labeled Broader Impacts in line with the National Science Foundation broader impacts criterion.  In this domain we provide ethics training on topics related to such issues as the effects of the choice of research questions, the impacts of scientific and engineering knowledge on society and the impact of society on the development of knowledge in science and engineering science, issues related to communication of science to the public, as well as issues related to expanding diversity within the science and engineering fields. \n\nWe have created eight modules in total (Figure A).  The first is an introductory online module that is broken into two parts: An Introduction to Moral Literacy and An Introduction to Ethical Dimensions of STEM Research.   These modules present researchers with an overview of ethics, moral literacy, an ethical analysis decision framework, and an introduction to the ethical dimensions of STEM research.  We also have six topical modules: Biofuels, Solar Photovoltaics, Conservation Science, Engineering Impacts, Public Health, and Research Subjects.  These specific topics were chosen not only for their connection to living in a sustainable world, but also for our ability to tap into the expertise of the Penn State community and the institutes, networks, and programs housed at Penn State. \n\nAll of these modules present training in the three domains of ethics relevant to STEM research: Research Integrity, Broader Impacts, and Embedded Ethics.  Those using the modules are provided with opportunities to develop skills in what we call \"ethics spotting\" and ethical analysis through case based learning.  Modules include video content from subject matter experts (Figure B) and interactive assessment questions (Figure C). \n\nModules include instructor guides for use in \u00e6flipped classrooms\u00c6 where students go through the online module outside of class and engage in activities based on that curriculum within the formal classroom.  The guide provides general information about flipped classrooms as well as module-specific inspiration activities for instructors that pertain to the specific module. \n\nIn addition to these online modules, the curriculum developed through this grant and co..."
