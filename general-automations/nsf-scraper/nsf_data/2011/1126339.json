The requested SEM will be used for studies in interdisciplinary areas of nanoscience, engineering and technology. The acquired instrument will be shared with several research groups, which provides training, service, and support to a large group of underrepresented students in Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe availability of this sophisticated and powerful SEM, not only improves the educational and research experiences of the students involved, but will also serve to develop a set of skills needed to become the next STEM workforce. Curriculum enhancement will occur in the existing science and engineering courses, and laboratories. Finally, in order to reach the K-12 educational sector, results of undergraduate projects and research will be used to create demonstrations and exhibits highlighting new and emerging sciences and engineering technologies. These activities will encourage K-12 students to pursue STEM careers.",
