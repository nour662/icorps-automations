Addressing this issue is not just a\r\nproblem of technology nor of simply deploying larger computers and data storage devices; (future)\r\nscientists need to develop the skills to effectively take advantage of the latest resources\r\nfor advancing scientific discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe Remote Data Analysis and Visualization Center (RDAV) is well-situated to address\r\nessential issues in workforce development by developing and providing a robust learning opportunity for  undergraduate students.  RDAV students work on developing software to address computational problems stemming from active projects in science and engineering and proposed by researchers who have been allocated computation time on RDAV?s Nautilus hardware. Experience with these hardware and software resources are each, separately, uncommon skills that undergraduates seldom encounter; the combination is extremely rare. These projects integrate experience working with high performance computing hardware as well as the specialized software tools used in scientific domains. Students gain important applicable skills in computational science.\r\n",
