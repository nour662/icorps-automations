 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is the efficient implementation of multiple control and non-control automotive applications in a distributed embedded system (DES) with a goal of developing safe, dependable, and secure Automotive CPS. DES are highly attractive due to the fact that they radically enhance the capabilities of the underlying system by linking a range of devices and sensors and allowing information to be processed in unprecedented ways. Deploying control and non-control applications on a modern DES, which uses advanced processor and communication technology, introduces a host of challenges in their analysis and synthesis, and leads to a large semantic gap between models and their implementation. This gap will be filled via the development of a novel CPS architecture by stitching together common fundamental principles of multimodality from real-time systems and related notions of switching in control theory and integrating them into a co-design of real-time platforms and adaptive controllers. This architecture will be validated at the Toyota Technical Center in the context of engine control and diagnostics.\r\n\r\nThe results of this project will provide the science and technology for a foundation in any and all infrastructure systems ranging from finance and energy to telecommunication and transportation where distributed embedded systems are present. In addition to training the graduate and undergraduate students, and mentoring a post-doctoral associate who will gain multi-domain expertise in advanced control, real-time computation and communication, and performance analysis, an inter-school graduate and an integrated summer course will be developed on control in embedded systems and combined with on-going outreach programs at MIT and UPenn for minority and women undergraduate students and K-12 students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary focus of the project was support for the development of multiple control applications in a network control system and a shared embedded computing platform that will run these applications.  An example of such a control system may be a modern car, which contains a number of computer-controlled safety features such as lane-keep asssist and adaptive cruise control.  These features are executed on a shared set of processors (called electronic control units, ECUs), connected by a controller area network (CAN) bus.  A typical system architecture is shown in Figure 1, with two ECUs sharing three control applications.  Interaction between control tasks is done by sending CAN messages across the network.  Messages can be delayed due to excessive buffering.  Late (overrun) messages cannot be used by the control algorithm and have to be dropped.  On the one hand, it is possible to design a high-capacity platform so that messages are never dropped, which wastes computing resources.  On the other hand, it is possible to design a control algorithm that can deal with worst-case delays that can be imposed by the platform, at the cost of reduced control performance.  Instead, this project has pursued a co-design approach that yields a control algorithm that maintains the desired level of performance and a platform that adaptively supports the control algorithm with the optimal amount of processing and networking resources.\n\nThe main outcome of this project is a framework for such co-design activity.  The framework includes the following components:\n\na control algorithm based on the previously developed concept of arbitrated networked control;\nan algorithm for platform modeling and analysis of message delays within the platform;\ntwo strategies for managing message overruns, called skip and abort; and\nan algorithm that calculates optimal threshold parameters for dynamically switching between overrun strategies, which minimize the overall cost of the design.  Here, the overall cost combines resource costs of the platform and the level of control performance the system achieves.\n\n\nEvaluation of the results using a sample control system comprised of several automotive safety features, deployed on a platform of two ECUs, shows a dramatic reduction of platform resources needed to achieve the desired level of control performance.  For example, Figure 2 shows an increase of the feasibility region in the design space, for the two ECUs in the system.  The graph shows that overrun strategies allow us to use much lower clock frequencies (that is, slower and thus cheaper hardware) to achieve the desired control performance, compared to worst-case design that avoids overruns altogether.\n\nOutcomes of the project have immediate applications in the practice of networked control systems engineering.  Using the developed techniques, engineers can lower the cost of future systems due to improved design efficiency and lower resource requirements.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Oleg Sokolsky"
