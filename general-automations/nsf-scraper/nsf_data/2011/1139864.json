In Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) this tessellation (or finite element mesh) is a critical component  for  patient-specific  bio-mechanics  and  bio-fluid finite element (FE)  simulations.  In this project, we target I2M conversion for image guided  neurosurgery and endoscopic neck and head surgery.  Specifically, we  focus  on FE-based non-rigid  registration methods  which  use patient-specific   bio-mechanical  models  to fuse pre-operative  intra-operative brain  images (eg.   Magnetic Resonance Images and/or Computed Tomography Scans).\r\n\r\nThe objective of  this project is to  extend the Delaunay  refinement  algorithms and theory for guaranteed quality    I2M   conversion  that  meets     additional requirements related to:  (1)  accuracy of non-rigid registration   of brain images, and (2)  real-time constrains imposed by neurosurgery or head and neck surgery. The intellectual merit of this work is the development of novel  theoretical framework  which  extends existing point  insertion methods for both scalar  and parallel guaranteed quality Delaunay mesh generation.  These  extensions increase algorithm flexibility which is important to  satisfy application-specific requirements like fidelity.\r\n\r\nThe  proposal will have a  broader impact on several areas in both  CAS and Computer Aided  Design (CAD).  Non-rigid registration of medical images is an enabling  technology for many applications in CAS which is  a  rapidly  growing  area in   health  care industry.    Our algorithms will contribute in the prevention of medical errors and the\r\nuse of new (more  effective/accurate)  technologies which can lead  to products (i.e., image  guided neuro-navigation systems) that will help reduce medical and  hospitalization expenses.  Specifically, (1) image guided neurosurgery  increases  the  percentage  of  successful  tumor resections while minimizing the  potential for neurological deficit by preserving critical tissue  and hence improves prognosis for  patient, and (2) minimally invasive  endoscopic  surgery results in less  blood loss  and reduced  post-operative  pain  lead  to faster recovery  and earlier discharge of patients.   In addition  technology based on  our I2M conversion algorithms can be  used in medical simulators which can improve doctor training and minimize errors in medical procedures.    \r\n",
