 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maintaining a sustainable society via technological innovations has been a major challenge for computing system design. In this project, we focus on the energy efficiency of an important type of computer applications, the database management systems (DBMS), which often consume a large portion of the computing resources and energy in modern data centers. The goal of this project is to design and implement a DBMS that enables significant energy conservation with graceful degradation of query processing performance. The project achieves its goal using the following approaches: (1) Dynamically exploit the energy-performance tradeoffs in DBMS as well as low-power modes of hardware systems for improved energy efficiency with performance guarantees; (2) Formulate the energy-efficient DBMS design as a feedback control problem, and adopt appropriate formal control techniques to achieve the desired performance and energy efficiency with theoretical analysis and guarantees; (3) Apply advanced multi-stage optimization methods to solve complex energy-aware storage management problems; and (4) Coordinate various control and optimization loops in different layers of the DBMS for maximized energy savings and global system stability. The broader impacts of the project are at two levels. At the society level, the reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emission by implementing the proposed energy-aware DBMS can be substantial. The project can benefit a large number of industrial sectors, the operations of which depend heavily on database-supported software such as online retailing systems, financial management software, and social networking platforms, by significantly lowering their electricity cost.  At the education level, the project trains Ph.D. students in an interdisciplinary environment and enhances several courses taught at the University of Florida and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville by providing a rich set of application examples, software tools, and project opportunities.

We proposed to exploit two new paradigms in DBMS design to achieve this goal. The first paradigm is to change the resource consumption patterns via energy-aware query optimization and reorganizing data records to enable load consolidation in disks. Based on the (estimated) energy and performance costs of query plans, energy-aware query optimization enables the selection of query plans with less energy consumption (and acceptable performance). The second paradigm is active control of power modes of hardware toward energy reduction.

First, for the first paradigm, we have conducted two research activities. Our first research activity was to experimentally explore the potential of power conservation in relational DBMS. We hypothesize that, by modifying the query optimizer in a DBMS to take the power cost of query plans into consideration, we will be able to reduce the power usage of database servers and control the tradeoffs between power consumption and system performance. We have identified the sources of such savings by investigating the resource consumption features during query processing in DBMSs. To that end, we have provided in-depth analysis of the power profile of typical queries in the TPC benchmarks. Our second research activity was the quantification of the energy cost of database systems. In this work, we focused on quantitatively modeling the energy cost of query plans during query optimization. We started from building a series of physical models for energy estimation of individual relational operators based on their resource consumption patterns. Since the execution of individual queries is a combination of relational operators, we used the physical models as a basis for a comprehensive energy cost estimation model for entire query plans. To further improve model accuracy under system dynamics and the variations of workload characteristics, we also developed an online model estimation scheme that dynamically corrects the static model based on advanced modeling techniques.
