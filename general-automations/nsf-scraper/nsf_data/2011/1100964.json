 "awd_abstract_narration": "Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, GA will host q-series 2011: A Conference on q-series, Partitions, and Special Functions over a three day period from March 14-16, 2011.  This conference will be the sixth in a series of international conferences on q-series and related topics held in the Southeastern United States. The previous five successful conferences were all held at the University of Florida in Gainesville (1999, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009).  \r\n\r\nThe conference immediately follows the AMS Southeast Sectional Meeting at Georgia Southern March 12-13, to make it convenient for interested parties to attend both events. There will be seven plenary speakers, who will give 50 minute talks; and about twenty-three 20-minute speakers.  One of the main goals of the conference is bring together mathematicians from around the world who are interested and q-series and related topics to learn about each other's current research, and to facilitate collaborations among them.  Talks will be presented by mathematicians from the level of graduate student through Professor Emeritus, and every level in between.  The conference will also honor the lifetime achievements of two distinguished mathematicians, Mourad E. H. Ismail and Dennis W. Stanton.\r\n\r\nThe theory of partitions and q-series lies in the intersection of number theory, combinatorics, and classical analysis, and has applications in physics, computer science, and vertex operator algebra theory.  Speakers will present talks which collectively will cover the breadth of this wide and deep subject area.",
