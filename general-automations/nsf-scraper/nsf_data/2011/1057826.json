 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop nanomanufacturing methods for producing nanocomposites for use in dentistry. Nanocomposites have shown great promise in dentistry but have limited applications because of the lack of reliable manufacturing methods to prepare them at scale.  This Phase II project seeks to develop a new, highly-efficient and low-cost approach to the manufacture of these materials that allows their assembly from the individual components at the nanoscale.  The process produces highly homogeneous nanomaterials with increased functionality.  These materials simultaneously have multiple property enhancements such as radiopacity (aiding diagnostic capabilities), high strength and durability, and improved optical properties.  This technology can be further leveraged to expand market opportunities into adjacent segments where cost constraints have limited the adoption of advanced nanocomposites.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide nanomaterial composites that improve the function of dental restorations and of biomedical implants. The technology is anticipated to facilitate medical implant materials that better integrate into the human body, improve durability and use-life, and aid diagnosis, ultimately reducing the rate of revision procedures and improving patient outcomes.  In the context of dental restoratives, these materials offer improved aesthetics, enhanced radiopacity for diagnostics, and state-of-the art strength and durability.  The development and maturation of the proposed products will have significant impact upon the dental industry, allowing dentists to better diagnose recurrent caries, which will improve clinical outcomes and ultimately reduce the occurrence of clinical revision/replacement procedures.  The cost savings associated with the new process will increase access of the general public to the highest quality dental restorations.",
