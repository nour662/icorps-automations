 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's request funding to develop BIOME, a Bio-Robotic Infrastructure for Oceanic Microbial Ecology. Coastal ecosystems are central to global biogeochemical cycles despite their relatively small size; therefore, biological oceanography has focused on understanding microbial bloom dynamics on continental shelves. Unfortunately, our concepts of how a diverse bacterial community transitions between seasons remain incomplete because of our inability to sample on the appropriate time and spaces scales to resolve the processes influencing the microbiota. In order to address this limitation, we are proposing a build a biological sampler compatible with the Slocum Glider. What is missing is a component capable of collecting and returning intact biomass to the laboratory for molecular ecology studies to delineate the mechanisms driving bacterial evolution in the sea. this project will provide a platform to define the metabolic and genomic properties and mechanisms responsible for microbial growth, adaptation, and survival in the oceanic environment. The BIOME research will address fundamental questions in marine ecology and elucidate the mechanisms supporting the diversity of microorganisms in the ocean.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  \r\n\r\nThe potential broad impacts of this proposal are greater than average because the device being designed has potential to be deployed widely if it is successful and would lead to more accurate models of ocean microbial community structure and activity. The PIs propose to develop a K-12 lesson plan about bacteria in the Mid-Atlantic Bight with the help of an education outreach specialist associated with the Mid Atlantic Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence, and have included this aspect of the project in the budget. There is a plan for disseminating the lessons to K-12 teachers through a variety of on-line and summer teacher training programs, to the public through lectures at local library, and to kids through the Rutgers 4-H after school programs. The PIs also intend (though don't lay out any specific plan) to include underrepresented ethnic groups in summer research through the RISE @ Rutgers program.",

Our original research plan included prototype construction in year 1 of the project, sampler/system optimization in year 2, and field deployment in year 3.  During the project our efforts to develop and publish a low power-room temperature preservation method, called BioDry (1) for biological molecules were successful.   Additionally, we designed a portable BioDry \"field unit\", constructed from off-the-shelf materials and a battery-operated pumping system, which also displayed high levels of microbial community preservation over 30 days (Fig 1).  Unfortunately, we were unable to meet many of these objectives of the project due to the inability of the various robotic prototypes we developed to adequately preserve nucleic acid samples.  However, it is hoped our publication will greatly assist other members of the ocean sciences community to develop robotic infrastructure to sample and preserve biomolecules for oceanic samples.  At this stage, a redesign of our robotic sampler is in order.\n\n In addition to the sampler, the project funds supported a graduate student determining the metabolic capability of microbes in a NJ salt marsh (2) and across the North Atlantic from Trinidad/Tobego to the Grand Banks (3).

Finally, some funding was also used to develop an approach to rapidly sequence bacterial ribosomal operons within natural samples with the Oxford Nanopore (ONT) MinIon.  The MinIOn is a 3rd generation system for direct sequencing of individual DNA molecules that fits in the palm of your hand (see Google Images).
