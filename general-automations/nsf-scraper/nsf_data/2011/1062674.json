 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Florida Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site on Infrastructure Materials provides 10 students each year the opportunity to work on interdisciplinary research that focuses on the behavior of infrastructure materials and components, particularly with respect to long-term durability and performance. Several different academic disciplines, including Materials Science, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering are represented, exposing students to a broad, interdisciplinary environment and providing them with diverse possibilities for research projects.\r\n\r\nTwo major events bookend the research experience. The activities begin with a two-day workshop introducing the students to the issues of infrastructure materials and corresponding research methods. At the end of the summer there is a two-day conference, at which the REU students give presentations and/or posters. In addition to the core research experience, students participate in activities to enhance their professional development, including seminars, laboratory tours, and a workshop on professional communications. There is also an extensive set of social activities at which students interact with each other and students from REUs in other disciplines in order to develop a broader social and professional network.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers.",
