 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural selection can play an important role in speciation, but few studies examine how mimicry may accelerate diversification, particularly in taxa distributed across a geographically complex region.  The genus Elymnias is a little-studied group of mimetic butterflies that vary dramatically in color, pattern, and size because different species frequently mimic dramatically different models. The evolutionary history of the 43 species in this genus will be inferred using DNA sequences from multiple genetic markers to address several key questions, including: 1) Have similar mimetic wing patterns evolved convergently?  2) What role has Southeast Asia's complex geography played in speciation?  3) Is divergence within a single landmass associated with shifts in mimetic color pattern? 4) Has sexually dimorphic mimicry evolved multiple times?\r\n\r\nBecause of its species richness and extreme wing pattern diversity, Elymnias promises to be an unparalleled taxon for studying rapid evolutionary change. The phylogenetic tree generated in this study will be used to frame future comparative studies, including genomics-driven approaches to identifying the genetic basis of wing pattern differences. The specimens, tissues, and data obtained in this study will be deposited in publicly accessible museums and databases. This project will support graduate and undergraduate students, including students from groups underrepresented in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\"Adaptive radiation\" is a process in which a single ancestor diversifies into an array of different species that exploit varied niches or environments.  In most well studied examples, species differentiate to utilize different food items or habitats, but the palm-feeding butterfly genus Elymnias seems to represent a novel form of adaptive radiation. Different species vary tremendously in wing color, pattern, shape, and size because most Elymnias species resemble different, unpalatable butterfly species to avoid being attacked by their enemies.  They are Batesian mimics.  Males and females of the same species often resemble different models and look very different from each other.  When predators in an area learn to avoid eating bad-tasting butterflies, this creates hypothetical \"enemy free morphospace\": if another perfectly edible butterfly could evolve the same colors and patterns, it would also be avoided by potential predators.  Elymnias seems to exemplify a novel adaptive radiation of Batesian mimics that diversified in the recent past. \n\nWe inferred the evolutionary history of the genus\u00c6 ~50 Asian and 1 African species using sequence data from six genetic markers.   The resulting evolutionary tree was used to estimate the timing of diversification and infer the group\u00c6s history of colonization across the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA), where many species are found on single islands and nowhere else.  We found that similar wing patterns occur in distantly related species, apparently because different Elymnias species on different islands evolved to mimic the same, widespread model species.  Convergent evolution might therefore be common in this genus.  About half of all species have males and females that mimic different models, but there was no consistent pattern in this sexual dimorphism.  It evolved (or was lost) independently many times throughout the group\u00c6s evolutionary history.\n\nWe examined the history of the group in light of current species distributions.  Only the large islands of Sulawesi and New Guinea host closely related, sister species.  Co-occurring species on other islands are never sister taxa.  The Asian species group appears to be only about 2 million years old, with many species dating to the last glacial maximum around 20,000 years ago when changes in sea level radically altered the spatial configuration of land and sea.  Altogether, this suggests that the dynamic and varied geography of the IAA set the stage for rapid diversification, followed by local morphological adaptation to resemble locally available, unpalatable model butterfly species.\n\nThis project strengthened international scientific collaboration between researchers from the United States and from several Asian countries.  The specimens used in this study were obtained in collaboration with investigators in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand.  Some specimens collected on these expeditions&mdash;including non-target species&mdash;fortified the tissue collection of the principal investigator, while the remainder were deposited in the national museum of their country of origin. Two graduate students and three undergraduate students participated in the molecular lab work, including one Latino undergraduate student.  To help communicate our work to the broadest possible audience, we obtained dorsal and ventral photographs of males and females from each species and uploaded them to discoverlife.org for incorporation into an electronic field guide and key.  Our findings profoundly change the species delimitation and taxonomy of the group, and we are therefore preparing a species richly illustrated revisionary checklist that will be published in an open-access, online journal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David J Lohman"
