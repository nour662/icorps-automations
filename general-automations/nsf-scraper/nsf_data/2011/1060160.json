 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Scholarship Program is to provide scholarships for 32 academically-talented, financially-challenged students in Industrial and Systems Engineering or Mechanical Engineering at Oakland University. Student scholars receive special training in PLM techniques, enabling them to assume leadership roles in an emerging field necessary to future engineering practice. Skills learned by the students are precisely those that are essential to revitalize, to diversify and to broaden Michigan's foundering economy. The goal of the program is to enable students to graduate in four years with a B.S. degree ready to enter the high technology workforce or continue on at the graduate level. Faculty, along with members of the student chapter of the Society of Women Engineers, work closely with the Oakland School district, SWE Detroit Section, Gear-Up Program, Detroit Area Pre College Engineering Program and Oakland University Public Schools Academy to recruit students into the program. Students are organized in cohorts and assigned faculty and industrial mentors. Industrial mentors assist the students in obtaining summer internships. Oakland's Academic Skills Center trains tutors dedicated to the program for individual tutoring during the first two years. The cohort is encouraged to participate in specially organized senior design projects.\r\nStudying the effects of faculty and industrial mentoring is driving changes in the fundamental structure of how Oakland University recruits, supports, and retains engineering students, especially under-represented minorities.",
