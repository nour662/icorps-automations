The approach is multidisciplinary and uses a combined experimental-modeling approach. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe research addresses the fundamental issues associated with the deposition and characterization of ultra-thin metal oxides and organic dyes on the surface of nanoporous inorganic photoelectrodes along with the characterization and analysis of charge transport at the gas phase synthesized organic-inorganic heterointerfaces. The major research tasks include: 1. Engineering electronic properties of nanostructured heterointerfaces using ultra-thin atomic layer deposited metal oxides, 2. Developing an organic dye loading process using a pulsed molecular layer deposition method, 3. Developing a high throughput DSC process, and 4. Understanding the charge transport and origin of efficiency enhancement in interface engineered DSCs.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nThe proposed research is expected to lead to new methodologies for enhancing electronic quality of photovoltaic heterointerfaces and loading organic light absorbers onto nanostructured inorganic photoelectrodes and open new paradigms in processing and cost-effectiveness of dye solar cells. Topics related to the proposed research will be integrated into the PI's \"Fundamentals of Photovoltaics\" and \"Advanced photovoltaics\" courses. This research will involve female students and students from underrepresented groups in the proposed research tasks. A one day long summer camp will be initiated to raise the awareness of Brookings high school students to the science and technology of green energy.",

The most time-consuming steps involved in DSC fabrication are linked with depositing thin films of material on porous electrodes. Therefore, using gas-phase deposition techniques was hypothesized to allow rapid deposition of these films, more uniform surface coverage, and better electron transfer. Over the course of the project, we successfully developed novel gas phase deposition techniques and integrated them into the DSC fabrication process, including a newly patented technique coined Functionalized Carboxylate Deposition (FCD). With FCD, we demonstration an efficient dye loading process lasting 15-20 minutes, about 100 times faster than the conventional wet chemical dye loading process. DSCs produced with FCD and probe dyes (i.e., low molecular weight dyes designated Dye 1 and Dye 2) produced approximately 3.3% efficiency each. These efficiencies are world record efficiencies for these dyes. Following this success, we began work on synthesizing higher efficiency DSC dyes that were compatible with FCD. We successfully synthesized a highly thermally stable N3 analog with FCD compatibility (i.e., N3 is a ruthenium organometallic dye that has produced about 10% efficient DSCs but is not compatible with FCD) and evaporated the N3 analog without significant thermal degradation in a custom FCD instrument. We are currently characterizing the N3 analog and will shortly fabricate DSCs based on FCD processing with this dye. Additionally, we pioneered a spray deposition technique to deposit platinum nanoparticles as a counterelectrode that uses about 10 times less material than the conventional sputter deposition method.
