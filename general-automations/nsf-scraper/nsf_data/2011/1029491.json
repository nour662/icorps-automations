 "awd_abstract_narration": "NanoExperiences: Pathways to Workforce Success is an out-of-school program that supports high school students in Career and Technical Education to prepare for post secondary education in multiple STEM career pathways related to nanoscale science and technology (NS&T).  The project builds on NS&T instructional materials developed and tested by Mid-Continent Research for Education and Learning (McREL), and others, on professional development being developed by McREL and on recent recommendations for structuring academically-focused out-of-school programs.  The one-year program combines academic learning of background information with additional supports.  In the first spring 20 students and their parents in two schools are introduced to NS&T concepts, tools and instrumentation; NS&T related occupations; and societal implications.  The five three hour sessions include large group meetings, presentations (both real and virtual) by workers in NS&T industries with teamwork projects between sessions.  In the summer, students and their parents plan for and make on-site visits at industries using NS&T and plan for their final projects on an NS&T related career.  In the fall, students plan the presentation on their project to be given in a symposium in November.  The project will evaluate and refine the experiences to modify the program for the second year with 20 students in the same schools and 20 more students in two other schools.  A NanoExperiences Toolkit developed and tested provides guidance for Colorado high schools to replicate the program with state partners including the Colorado Community College System.  The project is designed around common features of Career and Technology Education programs and should be useful across the nation.  \r\n\r\nThe evaluation, done by an external evaluator, measures student participation and the impact on student learning, interest and presentation skills.  The evaluation also investigates the collaborations with businesses, and the evidence for scalability to determine that NanoExperiences can serve as a national model.  Data are collected through teacher, student and collaborator surveys and interviews, student assessments, and observations.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the strategies project is to create a national model for developing an out-of-school time program to increase career and technical education students' interest and ability in STEM intensive careers.",

The project targets CTE programs, a significant component of the U.S. high school experience, and a growing national industry need for an educated \"middle-skills\" workforce in emerging sciences such as NS&amp;T. This strategies project designed a model for immediate replication across Colorado and for eventual scale-up across the nation. The resulting NanoExperiences Toolkit provides ready guidance for Colorado high schools to replicate the program across the state with project advisors, including the Colorado Community College System (a critical link between K-12 CTE programs and postsecondary options), positioned to support these sustainability efforts.

Project advisors who are interested in taking this strategies project to scale across the nation provide guidance to ensure the program is replicable and collaborate on future scale-up efforts.\n\nField Test Results. The field test year of the NanoExperiences project included a full test of the program in four participating high schools in the Denver Metro area. While there was significant attrition during the field test year, similar to the pilot year, external evaluators from BSCS were able to collect key data from a group of students a..."
