This scholarship project at the Rochester Institute of Technology is designed to increase the diversity in Engineering Technology by addressing factors that contribute to the underrepresentation of women and minorities in these majors.  The scholars in this program complete a course designed to enhance study skills, encourage graduate studies, emphasize workforce readiness, and build a community of scholars.  Scholars are linked with mentors from both academia and industry. Scholarships are offered to academically talented and economically disadvantaged freshman and third year transfer students.  One of the goals of this project is to demonstrate that the presence of a critical mass of underrepresented groups can aid in recruitment and retention of students in STEM disciplines. The project includes outreach activities led by the scholars that encourage K-12 students to consider STEM careers.",

The objectives of the COMETS program were to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Engage scholars in the Women in Technology community through participation in professional development workshops, socials, mentoring, and outreach events. </li>\n<li>Effectively prepare the scholars for the workforce or graduate school. </li>\n<li>Reinforce the students&rsquo; decision to major in Engineering Technology.</li>\n<li>Perform regular and thorough assessment of the CoMETS program.&nbsp; </li>\n<li>Identify scholars struggling academically and provide proactive academic support.&nbsp; </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The COMETS project strategies to achieve the objectives include academic, social support and professional skills development provided by the Women in Technology program in the college.
