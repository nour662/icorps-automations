These fields include bioenergy, climate change, biodiversity and Amazon studies, plant genomics, urban and area studies, optics and photonics, vaccines and drug discovery, stem cells, and tropical diseases. The event celebrates the 50-year anniversary of the S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, FAPESP). Brazil is an emerging actor in science and technology as well as financial, agricultural, and energy markets. In addition to these advances, as a large democracy, Brazil is one the United States? critical partners in the world. A joint scientific meeting is fitting to commemorate FAPESP and, moreover, to solidify the future of the US ? Brazil partnership.",
