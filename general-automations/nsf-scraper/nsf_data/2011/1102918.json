The researcher postulates that each polar region behaves as a self-sustained relaxation oscillator with its own natural frequency and nonlinear feedbacks influencing each other through dissipative coupling proportional to the temperature and heat storage gradients between North and South Atlantic Ocean and atmosphere.  The researcher will examine polar synchronization and the possible connection to Heinrich events. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the research include the support of a doctoral student and the participation of undergraduate students in the research project",
