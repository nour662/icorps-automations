 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports Skye Fortier of the University of Indiana as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.  Dr. Fortier will work on synthesizing new redox catalysts using earth-abundant transition metals and 'non-innocent' ligands.  The PI will collaborate with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory and Roosevelt University (Chicago).  The ultimate goal of this research is to develop efficient, inexpensive catalysts for chemical synthesis.  For his plan for broadening participation, Dr. Fortier will mentor young scientists at Indiana University and participate in a science summer camp for high school students and teachers.  \r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. Fortier is aimed at developing better ways of conducting chemical reactions.   The catalysts that Dr. Fortier will develop will use earth-abundant materials, and as a result will be less expensive.  The results of research like this can help scientists and the chemical industry do chemistry with less environmental impact.  The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Fortier are aimed at giving a young scientists and the public exposure to the chemical sciences.",
