 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is funding Professor Ana de Bettencourt-Dias at the University of Nevada-Reno to synthesize and study the photophysics of new derivatized pyridine-bis(oxazoline) (Pybox) lanthanide complexes.  While Pybox ligands have been extensively used in transition-metal catalyzed organic synthesis, it was only recently that their ability to efficiently sensitize lanthanide ion luminescence was reported.  In particular, the project seeks to establish a structure-function relationship of Pybox ligands with respect to sensitization of lanthanide ion luminescence.  Moreover, water-soluble complexes are being targeted for use in bioluminescence, as are complexes that can be incorporated into polymers,  for solid state lighting applications.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, this project has potential long-term scientific broader impacts in the areas of bioimaging and solid state materials. Moreover, research in lanthanide ion chemistry is potentially connected with the chemistry of actinides, as lanthanide complexes are sometimes used as surrogates to mimic the chemistry of the radioactive actinides.  Educational broader impacts include the training of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral co-workers in a multidisciplinary environment, including elements of synthetic organometallic chemistry and ofabsorption, excitation and emission spectroscopy.",
