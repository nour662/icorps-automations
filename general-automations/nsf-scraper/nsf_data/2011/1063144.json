 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to the University of Oregon that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students, during the summers of 2011- 2013. The REU Site Program in molecular biosciences focuses in studies involving molecular biology, structural biology and biophysics, developmental and cellular biology, molecular neurobiology, and molecular evolution. The Departments of Biology and Chemistry, the Institute of Molecular Biology, the Center for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and the Institute of Neuroscience have about 40 faculty potentially participating in the program. There is a wide range of exciting projects for interns. Interns participate in a full-time closely mentored lab research project as well as seminars and various professional development workshops, such as the responsible conduct of research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. Interns also have field trips, e.g. the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, the Pine Mountain Astronomical Observatory, and the Newberry Crater.  Each REU host lab is fully equipped with state of the art molecular bioscience tools, and the Institutes have extensive shared facilities. Interns are selected based on academic record, research interest, and exceptional potential for research careers in molecular biosciences. REU alumni are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Program evaluation is done formatively and summatively, internally and externally, and the assessment includes use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://biology.uoregon.edu/UOREU/ and by contacting the PI (Dr. Peter M. O'Day at oday@uoregon.edu).",
