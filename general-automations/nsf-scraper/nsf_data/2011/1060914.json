 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Hawai'i doctoral student Ashley Vaughan, supervised by Dr. Geoffrey White, will undertake research on the dynamics of decision-making processes in social contexts where both western and non-western alternatives are available. The aim is to elucidate both local and scientific approaches to decision-making by building multivariate, statistical and ethnographic decision tree models. The overarching question of the research is how do people make treatment choices when there are multiple medical systems and options?  \r\n\r\nVaughan will focus her research on decisions related to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of malarial infection in the Republic of Vanuatu. Vanuatu is an especially appropriate site for decision making research because it long has high rates of malaria, and it has experienced a national movement to protect and revive traditional knowledge and ways of life, including healing traditions. Preliminary research has shown that Vanuatu residents frequently combine biomedical, traditional, and religious treatments. The researcher will examine behavior using two kinds of models: ethnographic decision modes and multivariate socio-behavioral models. Data will be collected through participant observation, semi-structured and structured interviews, cognitive methods (pile sorts, consensus modeling), and surveys to identify political, economic, and socio-cultural factors influencing treatment selection.  \r\n\r\nThe research is important because it will contribute to social science theory and the development of new ways of combining ethnographic decision models with multivariate statistical models. Findings from the research will be useful for policy makers concerned with the persistence of malaria in Vanuatu, despite multiple public health interventions. Funding this research also supports the education of a graduate student.",

In particular, this research examined the specific roles of social and cultural variables in order to devise effective intervention strategies for developing countries.

Additionally, most residents frequently respond that one \"should go to the hospital\" (emphasis added) to get a blood test if he/she suspects that he/she has malaria.   Overall, then, it appears that the Vanuatu\u00c6s Ministry of Health\u00c6s malaria campaigns have been extremely successful in educating the people of Tautu. \n\nBut does everyone follow the advice of the Ministry of Health?  It is clear that many chose to ignore this advice.   People freely admit that they do not sleep under their bednets.  They say that the nets are too hot and that there is no airflow, so they have trouble sleeping.  While some say that they do go to the hospital when they suspect that they have malaria others chose not to go.
