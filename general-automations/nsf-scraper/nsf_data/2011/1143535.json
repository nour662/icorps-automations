An important segment of SWE?s membership consists of women in academia. Since retention and promotion of women in academia, especially within engineering disciplines continues to be a significant challenge, this workshop will assist faculty to acquire essential leadership and management skills. Senior women mentors will share their experiences with the participants during this workshop. The proposed workshop will offer executive leadership opportunities and key skills that will support career advancement for women academics in engineering. Participants will be encouraged to pursue the full diversity of roles within their organizations that offer opportunities for leadership. The workshop will be hosted in October 13-15, 2011 at SWE?s annual conference, WE11, in Chicago, IL. \r\nIn addition, participants will learn sound practices in advancement in academia and develop opportunities and mechanisms for networking across institutions. Specific objectives of the workshop are: \r\n? Increase the number of women in academic leadership positions \r\n? Provide key practices and information that will accelerate and enhance the success of women in academic leadership positions \r\n? Cultivate a network of practice for women engineering faculty leaders \r\n? Develop mentor relationships that benefit women engineering faculty who are seeking leadership roles.",
