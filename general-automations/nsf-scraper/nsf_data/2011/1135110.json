The University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML) will co-host the event along with the Center for High-rate Nanomanufacturing (CHN), and the Toxics Use Reduction Institute (TURI).  This Symposium is the fifth in a series of international symposia, which have been held over the past decade to address concerns about the toxicity and potentially adverse environmental impacts associated with the rapidly increasing development and use of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs).\r\n\r\nThis series of symposia has evolved into the premier international gathering to discuss the toxicity and potentially adverse environmental aspects of ENP use.  The very latest research on this new and emerging technology field will be presented and discussed by leading international scientists. \r\n\r\nThe Symposium will be organized around three themes:  \r\n\r\n(1)\tNanoparticle exposure assessment and control \r\n(2)\tEngineered nanoparticle toxicology and adverse health effects \r\n(3)\tPolicy and regulatory aspects of nanotechnology health and safety\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe Symposium will identify crucial knowledge gaps, research accomplishments, and future needs in the field.  Key findings from the Symposium will be published in a special issue of the Journal of Nanoparticle Research. \r\n\r\nA special effort will be made to ensure the involvement of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. The conference co-chair is a woman, the first female co-chair in this symposium series.",
