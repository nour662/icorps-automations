 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research between the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (UPM, Spain), IMDEA Materials Institute (Madrid, Spain),  and Michigan State University (MSU) combines an experimental and computational plan to study the microstructural evolution during processing and the damage nucleation and progression that occurs due to mechanical deformation in magnesium-manganese-rare earth (Mg-Mn-RE) alloys.  Microstructural characterization is performed in order to develop a crystallographically-based understanding of how details of the deformation behavior correlate with grain nucleation and grain growth during processing and damage nucleation during ambient and elevated-temperature tension and creep experiments.  In-situ tensile and tensile-creep experiments performed inside a scanning electron microscope allow for the identification of the initial damage events and deformation progression as well as the deformation evolution.  Simulations of experimentally-characterized microstructures provide a means to interpret and analyze the quantitative experimental data.  The details of deformation processes that cause damage are quantitatively identified.  Such details provide the framework for introducing damage nucleation and deformation evolution information into microstructural models.  The methodology developed integrates material and component design by developing predictive capabilities that link microstructural response with macrostructure performance.\r\n\r\nThis work seeks to overcome one of the most challenging aspects of structural alloys, increasing ambient and elevated-temperature strength and creep resistance while maintaining ductility.  Other aspects of the work entail producing educational modules on processing and characterization of Mg alloys, expanding an established K-12 outreach program at MSU so that it can reach more K-12 students in the USA and Spain through remote operation of a SEM, providing research opportunities for undergraduate students involved in existing MSU programs as well as those to be involved in the study abroad program between MSU and the UPM.  The educational modules are intended to promote materials education of Mg alloys.  They are appropriate for inclusion in K-12 curriculum, and are created both in English and Spanish, the latter of which can be used not only in Spain but also in Spanish-speaking communities in the USA.  Overall, the proposed international effort is intended to make a lasting effect by understanding processing-microstructure-property relationships of novel Mg-Mn-RE alloys, while also educating young scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDue to their high specific strength, lightweight magnesium (Mg) alloys are being increasingly used for applications, such as the automotive industry, where weight savings are critical.  In order to develop new alloys and processing methods to achieve higher strength and better formability to compete with currently used metal alloys, it is important to understand the effects of alloying elements, processing, and temperature on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and the deformation behavior. \n\n            In this program, a systematic investigation on the effects of Nd additions (0-1wt.%) and temperature (298-523K) on the microstructure and the activity of different deformation modes in as-cast and cast-then-extruded Mg-1Mn (wt.%) alloys were performed.  For this study, an in-situ testing technique which combines tension and compression testing inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis was employed. \n\n            The main findings of this work were that the microstructure, strength, and the distribution of the deformation modes varied significantly as a function of Nd content, temperature, and processing.  An increase in the Nd content resulted in a weaker texture after extrusion in Mg-1Mn alloys.  A combination of dislocation slip and twinning mechanisms controlled the tensile deformation in the extruded materials at ambient temperatures.  With an increase in temperature, the twinning activity decreased, and slip mechanisms dominated the deformation.  In the extruded Nd-containing alloys, basal  slip dominated the deformation, especially at elevated temperatures, suggesting that Nd additions strengthen basal  slip.  This resulted in excellent elevated-temperature strength retention in the extruded Mg-1Mn-1Nd alloy, and a decrease in the Nd content to 0-0.3wt.% resulted in a decrease in the tensile strength at elevated temperatures.  In extruded Mg-1Mn, contraction twinning dominated the tensile deformation and the material pre-maturely failed at 323K.  With an increase in strain, these twins evolved into  double twins.  Crystal plasticity modeling and simulation of the contraction twins and  double twins showed that the activity of these mechanisms is detrimental to the elongation-to-failure of Mg alloys due to the strain localization that could happen within the twinned volume due to the enhanced activity of basal  slip.  Compared to the extruded materials, the as-cast alloys exhibited significantly larger grain sizes and lower tensile strength.  The deformation in the as-cast alloys was dominated by a combination of basal  slip and extension twinning at all tested temperatures.\n\n \n\n            A novel methodology which combines in-situ annealing inside a SEM with EBSD analysis was developed and employed to understand the effects of dilute Ce additions (0.2-0.6wt.%) on the recrystallization behavior in Mg-2Zn (wt.%) alloys.  The mechanisms responsible for the texture weakening in these alloys were found out to be the formation of an enhanced number of grain boundaries with  rotation axis during recrystallization and the uniform distribution of the misorientation angles.  This methodology will be valuable for future recrystallization studies on Mg and other alloy systems.\n\n\n\n            Overall, the insights gained from this program have a broad impact on understanding the deformation behavior and microstructural evolution of RE-containing Mg alloys, which can serve as guidance for the development of new alloys and processes.   The information and data provided in this program can also serve as inputs for the development of accurate crystal plasticity models in the future.\n\nIn addition to the research highlights mentioned above, this program educated over 500 K-12 students and teachers through educational outreach activites.  Outreach videos were produced, through a 4H program, involving materials science and engineering demonstrations.  Thus this program had a br..."
