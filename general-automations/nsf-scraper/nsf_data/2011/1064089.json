 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAGER award funds a workshop that will bring together an international group of researchers to discuss a possible consortium effort to explore the links between genetics and a range of human social and economic behaviors.  Recent research has demonstrated that very large sample sizes are necessary to conduct statistically sound tests of new theories about how genes influence social behavior.  The workshop attendees represent a wide range of social science and health surveys that gather information about social, eductional, health, and economic variables.  At the meeting, they will be working together to explore whether an organized joint effort might bring their separate research projects together to make innovative new research possible on the frontier of research into the human genome.",

No such consortium previously existed. The SSGAC was founded in February 2011 in conjunction with CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology), a successful pre-existing medical genetics consortium. The objective was successfully achieved and the creation of SSGAC led to effective collaboration across disciplines, resulting in scientific advances.\n \nFour SSGAC workshops have been held in 2011, 2012, and 2013, in the USA (Boston and Los Angeles), Iceland, and the Netherlands. Each workshop brought together researchers from around the globe to share methods and results and discuss opportunities for collaboration. \n \n\nProjects initiated by and supported by the SSGAC have yielded numerous results, which have been disseminated broadly through publications in top scientific journals, presentations at conferences, and general press coverage.\n \nOne major research initiative that emerged from the SSGAC was the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of educational attainment, which successfully identified several genetic variants and was published in Science in 2013. A second phase of that project, aiming to identify additional genetic variants, was launched in the fall of 2013. Second, the first set of results on another SSGAC initiative, self-employment, was published in PLoS ONE in 2013. Third, several members of the SSGAC Advisory Board spearheaded the study of the predictive power contained in whole-genome data for several social science traits. Two papers were published in PNAS in 2012 reporting these analyses: \"The Genetic Architecture of Economic and Political Preferences\" and \"Molecular Genetics and Subjective Well-Being.\" Fourth, a more general paper overviewing the field was published in American Journal of Public Health, entitled \"Why Is It Hard to Find Genes that are Associated with Social Science Traits? Theoretical and Empirical Considerations.\"\n \nOther research initiatives launched by SSGAC are ongoing and include GWAS meta-analyses of fertility, marital status, and subjective well-being; as well as examining the feasibility of GWAS meta-analyses of other behavioral traits (e.g., risk preferences, trust and political preferences.) These efforts will require coordination of additional data collection, and the SSGAC is supporting cohorts interested in participating in instrument development. \n \nThis award has helped support and train young researchers, including a post-doctoral fellow and PhD students (several from underrepresented groups), as well as numerous postdoctoral researchers and students who attended the four educational SSGAC workshops (which included overviews of the field and new methods talks by prominent researchers). These workshops served as one of the main forums through which research results were disseminated, contributing to scientific progress at the intersection of social science and genetics. Many of the participants had not previously been aware of this field and were able to receive a comprehensive overview at the meeting. In addition, results from the projects spearheaded by the SSGAC have been presented in general-audience university seminars around the world (e.g., Harvard University, University of Chicago, UC-Berkeley, University of Zurich, National University of Singapore). \n \nThe work supported by this grant confers substantial benefits to ..."
