Develops Bacterial Culture to Degrade PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) Contamination in Sediments and Groundwater, Supported by NSF Small Business Funding\n\nBioremediation Consulting Inc. (BCI), funded by an NSF Small Business Innovation Research grant, has successfully developed a bacteria that can degrade the toxic environmental contaminants, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  PCBs are toxic chemicals used historically as heat-resistant fluids in many industrial applications, including transformers in the electric utility industry. Several hundred million pounds were manufactured and disposed, resulting in contamination of groundwater and river sediments. PCBs are persistent, toxic, very insoluble, and bioaccumulate in the ecosystem, contaminating fish and aquatic wildlife.  Of the millions of pounds of PCBs disposed, most remain untreated. \n\nThree decades after PCBs were banned in the U.S., there have been few advances in remediation of PCB-contaminated soils and sediments. Incineration, the established treatment, costs around $1000/ton, while less reliable physical/chemical treatments cost up to $500/ton. Thus, there is a need for a less expensive process, such as biological treatment using special bacteria to break down the PCB molecule.  Currently, dredged sediments are piled for long-term storage.\n\n Until BCI\u00c6s development of PCB-degrading bacteria, there was no commercial biotreatment of highly-chlorinated PCBs.  BCI used its NSF funding to document that its culture could remove the chlorine atoms from dozens of related PCB molecules.  BCI also developed a proprietary process to grow this bacteria quickly in liquid culture, so that it could be used to inoculate contaminated sites and dredged river sediments containing PCBs.  The BCI bacteria are members of the genus Dehalococcoides, which has been shown by BCI and others to degrade related chlorinated contaminants such as the cleaning solvent perchloroethene (PCE). \n\nMajor stakeholders in the utility industries and remediation contractors have expressed interest in partnering with BCI or obtaining culture.
