The proposed new modeling technique allows profound insight into the flow properties of different types (linear vs. branched) polymers and their mixtures.  Such an understanding has been long sought in order to address issues in materials design and polymer processing. Ultimately, such understanding will lead to the best combination of polymer types that achieve a desired technical objective.  Improved understanding of polymer flow properties provides a means of designing optimized additives capable of delivering desired properties.  For validation, results from the new simulation techniques will be held against existing experimental data for novel polymer architectures and then used to design polymer mixtures having desirable processing characteristics.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the work lies in developing the computer codes and in generating rheological data for complex polymeric systems.  The work builds on existing success in accurately and completely describing the melt rheological properties of linear architectures using these same simulation techniques.  In addition to the effects of chain architecture, confinement effects on flow are studied.  The results generated can shed insight into novel confinement effects that are being exploited in emerging areas of nanotechnology.  \r\n\r\nThe activities pursued integrate research and teaching while promoting discovery; to successfully complete the project several subjects must be mastered including polymer science, statistical mechanics, computer science, and molecular visualization.  Computer programs for performing the simulations will be shared via posting on the CSM Chemical Engineering web pages. Additional dissemination of the results will be accomplished through publication in widely available scientific journals (J. Chemical Physics and Macromolecules) and presentations at national (ACS, APS, AICHE, and SoR (Society of Rheology) and international meetings (Polymer Processing Society, International Congress of Rheology).  \r\n\r\nThe commitment to diversity evidenced by past performance by the PI will be continued.  In addition to direct support of underrepresented groups as graduate students, outreach activities will be continued.  Supported graduate students all participate in MentorNet as a means of providing role models to younger students.  The Denver, Colorado region is particularly rich for recruiting Hispanic and Native American students.   The PI has worked extensively with students from varied backgrounds, particularly in the context of the NSF supported Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcome or Accomplishment:  Researchers at Colorado School of Mines developed a new powerful computational method that allows for the efficient modeling of polymer melts, more commonly known as plastics.  These materials are very important in the fabrication of almost all manufactured goods.  Unlike other techniques, this computational method is able to capture all the molecular details of polymer flow, which cannot be seen by the naked eye.  This method helps engineers overcome limitations rate in many polymer operations.  Overcoming these limitations improves the economic productivity of many manufacturing processes.\n\nImpact:  The ability to predict the flow behavior based on molecular characteristics enables the design of plastics with superior properties.  For example, the viscosity can be reduced which means less energy is needed to process the material into useful articles like plastic bags or car parts.  The new computational method has been able to reproduce all of the known phenomena associated with the flow of the normal types of plastic materials and generate interesting results that advance current understanding about how polymers flow near solid surfaces.  Nobel laureate Pierre-Gilles de Gennes postulated some key physical ideas about such flows. However, molecular scale confirmation of these ideas was not available.  The new simulations supported by NSF-funded research have confirmed some aspects of previous ideas but have also brought forth new ideas and insights that have important industrial and scientific consequences.  The work is relevant to applications ranging from the manufacture of plastic bags in high-speed extrusion operations to the separation of DNA molecules in microfluidic devices.  \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John R Dorgan"
