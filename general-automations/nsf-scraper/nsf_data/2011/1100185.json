The CCBG sensor inherits many advantages from its optical counterpart, such as high resolution, remote operation and multiplexing capability, but has much improved robustness, reliability and survivability for SHM.  \r\nTwo innovative approaches, the segmented transmission-line approach and the coupled mode theory for coaxial cable, will be investigated to understand device physics and to guide device design and fabrication.  In addition, both the low-cost, controlled deformation method and the high-precision, laser hole-drilling method will be studied to fabricate high-quality CCBG devices. The strain-induced frequency shifts of multiplexed CCBG sensors will be  processed using the cross-correlation method.  These innovations will be well integrated leading to the development and demonstration of the new, robust CCBG sensor platform for large-strain measurements.\r\nThe research will be effectively integrated into education through carefully planned educational and outreach activities, including course enhancement, involvement of undergraduate and graduate students into research, recruitment of women and minority students, and outreach to middle/high school students through hands-on workshops and science projects.",
