In most crop plants, sucrose is the principal carbohydrate translocated long-distance through the phloem tissue within veins. Although physiological studies have determined the site of sucrose synthesis and its translocation path through the phloem, very little is known about the genes that control the distribution of carbohydrates within plants. The objectives of this project are to provide a comprehensive understanding of the gene regulatory network controlling whole-plant carbohydrate partitioning in maize, a crop of vital significance to the agriculture and economy of the U.S. The project will use genetic and genomic experiments to identify the genes regulating carbon export from leaves and import into seeds, employ next generation sequencing to characterize genes expressed along the sucrose transport route through the phloem, and exploit the vast genetic diversity within maize to discover novel genetic modifiers of carbohydrate partitioning. Collectively, this knowledge will generate testable hypotheses about the functions of genes that underlie long-distance transport of carbohydrates, providing new insight that may translate into gains in food production, environmental stress tolerance, biomass accumulation for production of biofuels, and strategies to use plants for carbon sequestration.  \r\n\r\nThis project will help train and mentor the next generation of scientists by recruiting undergraduate students from a small liberal arts college and partnering them with undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral colleagues from major research universities.  In coordination with the Vermont EPSCoR program, the project will develop a summer workshop for high school students and teachers that will focus on the research goals of the project  and will help the participants develop a high school teaching module on plant genomics and carbohydrate partitioning.  Community resources that include quality-controlled expression data will be deposited into public databases such as GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank/), the Maize Genome Database (www.maizegdb.org/), and Gramene (www.gramene.org/).  Genetic stocks will be made available through the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center (www.maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu/).   A project website will be developed to communicate the research discoveries and educational outcomes of this project broadly to other scientists and to the public.",

Sugars are produced in leaves from photosynthesis, but must be transported to all non-photosynthetic organs (e.g., stems, roots, flowers, seeds) to sustain their growth, development, and nutrient storage (e.g., protein, fiber, carbohydrates, vitamins). Determining how carbohydrate partitioning is regulated, and how to manipulate it within plants, is a critical step to increasing crop yields, biofuel production, and for enhancing carbon dioxide sequestration from the atmosphere. To better understand carbohydrate partitioning, we characterized key genes involved in sugar production, metabolism, long-distance transport, and storage in maize (corn). To do so, we used a combination of approaches that included the following: 1) New genes and their contributions were identified by characterizing mutants with informative phenotypes (such as &ldquo;defective carbohydrate partitioning&rdquo;), then determining which genes were responsible (by using map-based cloning coupled with whole-genome sequencing). 2) Hypotheses for the functions of specific gene were also tested by examining mutants known to be dysfunctional for their expression (reverse-genetics). 3) In addition, comparative genomics and phylogenetics were used to reveal clues from diverse species. 4) Further work targeted gene functions in specific cell types vital to sugar transport by focused transcriptomics and metabolic profiling. 5) Still other analyses used quantitative genetic approaches to investigate the basis for natural variation among different lines of maize. Results led to identification of enzymes and transporters involved in sugar transport through the vascular system. This in turn allowed elucidation of genes important for carbohydrate storage in-, and export from-, leaves to kernels. Additionally, we discovered several genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis that affect the capacity of veins to transport nutrients.
