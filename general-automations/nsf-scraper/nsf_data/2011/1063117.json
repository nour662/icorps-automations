Energy is a springboard to all aspects of sustainability; energy production and use represent one of the most critical technological challenges of our era. The energy and sustainability theme of our REU site offers students the chance to engage in the solution of a crucial problem for their generation and beyond.  Energy infrastructure for the 21st Century is a computing systems problem. The IT for Sustainability research theme includes a range of research projects including optimal control of building systems; energy efficient air traffic control; mobile sensing to assess health impacts of traffic; energy management systems to reduce waste in buildings; and personalized real-time footprint tracking for energy management.  This research theme presents a basic opportunity for undergraduates to get involved in new research that combines intellectual merit and technical opportunities with very broad impact (such as the possibility of improving the environment and the quality of people's lives).",

During the three years of the program the number of applications has steadily increased.  In addition to an overall increase in the numbers of applicants, we have also seen increases in the number of applications from women and underrepresented minorities.  We attribute the increase in number of applications due to the effective recruitment strategies employed by our EECS Department and the focus on recruiting women and underrepresented minority students.   Of the 27 students that have been participated in the SUPERB-ITS REU at UC Berkeley 63% were Women, 22% were African American, and 26 % were Latino/a. \n\n \n\nOne hundred percent of the accepted students completed the program.
