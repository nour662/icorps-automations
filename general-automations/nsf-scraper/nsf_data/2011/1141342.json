The first phase covers the \r\nformal four-month transfer period while the second is an ongoing process of integration and adjustment, \r\nwhich will continue throughout the first year of the new Cooperative Agreement. An important feature of \r\nthe transition process is the immediate appointment and relocation of the Director-designate/PI as the on- \r\nsite transition manager to provide clear responsibility and accountability for transition implementation,\r\nand collaborative alignment with the incumbent, NSF, NASA, and the staff.",
