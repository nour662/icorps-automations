 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the technical and commercial viability of a novel four-way catalytic converter for lean burn diesel applications that is based on high-surface area nanomaterials applied directly to the inner walls of existing catalytic converter monoliths. While there is ongoing research to integrate diesel particulate filters and the oxidation catalyst, there is little research addressing the integration of all four components (oxidation of carbon monoxide, oxidation of hydrocarbons, capture and destruction of carbon particulate matter (PM) and reduction of NOx.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are that in 2013 strict requirements for diesel emissions standards will become law. These new regulations will effect carbon emissions both in terms of particle size and number of particles. While there are proposals to meet impending PM regulations, none actively integrate all the required functions of a catalytic converter. Therefore the potential U.S. commercial value of the catalytic converter structure from this project is significant. The European market opportunity may be larger since diesel engines are more prevalent in Europe.",
