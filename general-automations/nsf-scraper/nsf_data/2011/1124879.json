 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program, Professor Hinch and her coworkers in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Rutgers University are using high resolution angular diffraction and time of flight analysis of thermal helium scattering to investigate structure, assembly and low energy molecule surface vibrations of adsorbed amino acids. This International Collaboration in Chemistry award includes a collaborator, Professor Stephen J. Jenkins at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom.  His work is supported by EPSRC in the United Kingdom.  The interactions of alanine, glycine and proline adsorbates with coinage metal surfaces are the focus of this research. These systems are believed to adsorb as carboxylate species and the amino groups may or may not undergo protonation. Information about chirality and possible racemization of adsorbed phases will be evident in the surface sensitive diffraction measurements. The real time kinetics of film assembly of these molecules on the surfaces, determined with this non destructive probe, will provide an understanding of the long- and short- range intermolecular interactions. In transitioning from low to high coverage regimes, changes in the discrete vibrational modes, and the effective masses of the scattering centers, will elucidate the significance of hydrogen bonding in these self assembled films.  The low energy vibrational spectra are also to determine the influence of coadsorbed hydrogen levels in film stability, kinetics of assembly and surface diffusion and reaction mechanisms. Through collaboration with Professor Jenkins' group at Cambridge University, the Hinch group at Rutgers will also be able to utilize high-resolution low-temperature scanning probe techniques for studies of amino acid films.  The international collaboration also offers a powerful computational capability and understanding of the multi-dimensional potential energy surfaces governing vibrational motion in simple adsorbed amino acids.  A mutual objective is to image, simulate, and measure the dynamics within hydrogen bonding networks established in the amino acid films.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis research will advance the understanding of the behavior of molecules adsorbed on surfaces. The knowledge obtained will implications for a variety of fields and applications, including chirally-specific sensors, enantioselective chemical synthesis, and possibly medical implant materials with improved biocompatibility.  The research also has considerable workforce development benefits, as graduate and undergraduate students and post-doctoral associates will engage in a richly interdisciplinary research experience, which entails a variety of experimental techniques as well as theory and computation.  The student experience will be further augmented by the international exchange aspects; extended visits by Rutgers and Cambridge group researchers to the partnering laboratory will provide invaluable experience with research environments beyond each participant's home institution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was undertaken at Rutgers University, and in collaboration with experimental and theoretical research groups in Cambridge University, UK.  The combination of researchers has enabled the initiation of a diverse set of new studies, with the mutually beneficial involvement of others.\n\nAlanine, the smallest of all amino acids which exhibits a handedness (chirality,) was adsorbed on a single crystal copper surface. The adsorbate is seen to exhibit long range ordering, as seen by the diffraction of scattering helium (He) atoms.  The benign probe does not damage the adsorbate and specifically indicates a stable array which still reflects the handedness of the parent molecule on this metallic interface.  He atoms can also undergo a spectroscopic energy transfer on scattering.  Discrete energy losses and gains indicate a well-defined vibrational motion of the adsorbate with a characteristic energy of 5.5meV. The frequency of vibration is in excellent agreement with the results of collaborative density functional calculations, suggesting the adsorbate flexes at the surface, whilst being tethered to the surface at three points of the molecule.  The large amplitude motion of one methyl group of the molecule indicates a previously unobserved flexibility of the molecular backbone in an adsorbed amino-acid.  This observation will have implications in understanding the attachment and dynamics of other amino acids on metallic faces.\n\nThe same technique was used to monitor the assembly of the alaninate array, during exposure to the parent molecule.  The molecules appear to be moderately mobile in that they are able to move and align to form extensive clusters of ordered alaninate arrays at low surface densities.  The energy of condensation has been evaluated directly, and is consistent with the primary mutual interaction being through hydrogen bonding.\n\nOn the copper surface the alaninate network at low densities has been demonstrated to be unstable, and a more stable alternative phase evolves over a longer time scale of order tens of minutes.  However, the original network does appear stable over very long timescales once a critical coverage is exceeded.  The nature of the most stable phase remains unidentified.\n\nIn collaboration with Cambridge researchers, studies of molecular adsorbate diffusion on metallic surfaces have also been initiated.  Extended ring molecules have been shown to be highly mobile, and to exhibit lateral motion as well as other aperiodic motion.  Key to these studies is an understanding of friction, as experienced by individual molecules.  Friction determines the rate of energy transfer between various degrees of freedom in adsorbate phases.\n\nOverall the international collaborative program has much enhanced the availability of experimental techniques, the ability to simulate molecular adsorption, and has dramatically opened up the viewpoints of the principle investigator, post-doctoral trainee and graduate and undergraduate students.\n\nThe project has also included a technological component; a new ionizer has been designed for time resolved detection of scattered He atoms.  The ionizer is to have an enhanced sensitivity and has potential use in time sensitive measurement of molecular beam intensities.  It is anticipated that after full testing of the prototype such designs will be of use in many other research programs. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barbara J Hinch"
