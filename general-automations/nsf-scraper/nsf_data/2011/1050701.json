 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, researchers from Washington University in St. Louis will study how nervous systems use time to analyze sensory information. Peripheral sensory systems often encode stimuli into the precise timing of neural activity. However, little is known about how central brain circuits analyze these temporal codes so that an organism can detect and respond to behaviorally-relevant stimuli. The goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms that mediate the processing of temporal codes by synapses, neurons and circuits. Electric fish are exquisitely sensitive to timing information. In addition, the relevant brain circuits are uniquely approachable in both intact animals and reduced preparations, providing a rare opportunity to directly link information processing to synaptic physiology. Using a combination of electrophysiology, neuronal imaging and pharmacology, the researchers will determine how the brains of electric fish can detect small differences in the timing of neuronal activity. This research will prove broadly applicable by providing a mechanistic understanding of how all brains process sensory information. In addition, the project will lead to the development of novel, widely applicable methods for the targeted recording of neurons in intact animals. Electric fish are an excellent tool for educating the public about neuroscience and behavior. As exotic creatures, they attract a wide audience, and they provide a unique opportunity to perform simple, non-invasive neurophysiology experiments. Students, teachers and the general public will develop their own scientific hypotheses, design and execute experiments to test those hypotheses, and then discuss the results in an open forum. Exposing students, teachers and the public to the process of scientific inquiry will help demystify science and foster a deeper appreciation for the nature of scientific knowledge.",
