 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (the IRIS Consortium,\r\nwww.iris.edu) operates multi-user facilities for the development, deployment, and operational\r\nsupport of modern digital seismic instrumentation and data management to serve national and\r\ninternational research and education in the Earth sciences. IRIS programs are overseen and\r\ngoverned by a Consortium of 115 Member Institutions, comprising virtually every US university\r\nwith research programs in seismology. Consortium membership also includes 107 Foreign\r\nAffiliates and 20 Educational Affiliates. IRIS collaborates with national and international\r\nmission agencies, including the USGS, NOAA, DOE, DOD and the Comprehensive Test Ban\r\nTreaty Organization, to leverage NSF investments to serve significant societal needs in the\r\nmonitoring of earthquakes, tsunamis and nuclear test ban treaties.\r\nThe preeminence of US Earth science in investigations of the Earth?s interior and\r\nearthquake sources rests in large part on the data and instrumentation facilities supported by NSF\r\nand managed by IRIS. The programs and activities to be carried out by IRIS under this award\r\ntake their intellectual direction from a community-based long-range science plan described in the\r\n2009 report: ?Seismological Grand Challenges in Understanding Earth?s Dynamic Systems?\r\n(www.iris.edu/hq/files/publications/iris_proposals/doc/seis_plan_final.pdf). Seismology provides\r\na rich source of information on the structure and composition of Earth's crust, mantle, and core\r\nthat, when coupled with other types of data in the growing number of interdisciplinary studies to\r\nwhich IRIS is committed, continues to enhance our understanding the origin of the planet, its\r\nevolution through geologic time, as well as the internal forces driving plate dynamics,\r\nearthquakes, volcanism, and the geomagnetic field. Recent developments in seismic sensor design,\r\nand the acquisition, transmission and storage of data have resulted in dramatic improvements in\r\nthe resolving power of seismic imaging of Earth?s interior and characterization of the earthquake\r\nsource. In addition to supporting basic research and discovery in the Earth sciences, the IRIS\r\nfacilities also contribute essential data, resources and educational materials to programs with\r\nbroad societal impact related to earthquake hazard mitigation, groundwater, energy and mineral\r\nexploration.\r\nThe facilities and services managed by IRIS include:\r\n? Instrumentation Services - operation and support for the 150 permanent broadband\r\nstations of the Global Seismographic Network (in collaboration with the USGS) and a pool of\r\nmore than 2000 portable instruments of the Program for Array Seismic Studies of the Continental\r\nLithosphere (PASSCAL) for denser deployments in NSF-funded research projects both in the US\r\nand abroad.\r\n? Data Services ? free and open access through the IRIS Data Management Center to all\r\ndata collected by IRIS programs or contributed by numerous national and international partners,\r\nalong with support for software development, user tools, training services and data products to\r\nfacilitate broad data utilization and encourage high quality standards in data collection and data\r\nmanagement.\r\n? Education and Public Outreach - creating materials and tools to encourage the public\r\nand educators at all levels to explore seismological data and advance awareness and\r\nunderstanding of seismology & Earth science, while inspiring careers in geophysics.\r\nUnder the new Cooperative Agreement with NSF starting in 2011, IRIS will merge its\r\nlong-standing support for Polar studies in both the Antarctic and Arctic with its other core\r\nservices; move towards integrated management, starting in 2013, of its core programs with the\r\nrelated facilities of the USArray component of EarthScope; and continue to explore emerging\r\nopportunities to support research and hazard mitigation efforts in earthquake prone areas of the\r\ndeveloping world.",
