 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders focuses on building partnerships and enabling interdisciplinary large-scale research between the basic and applied sciences, which are necessary to understand the normal brain and nervous system, as well as, disorders in their structure and function. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Bruce M. Altevogt of the National Academy of Sciences directs the Forum, which brings together leaders from private sector sponsors of basic research, biomedical and clinical research, federal agencies sponsoring and regulating biomedical and clinical research, foundations, the academic community, and consumers. Quarterly the membership plans and organizes meetings to discuss issues of mutual interest and concern. In addition, the Forum sponsors workshops for members and the public to discuss approaches to resolve key challenges identified by Forum members. For example, upcoming workshops are addressing topics such as training and education for the next generation of neuroscientists, neuroscience animal models, environmental and genetic factors that affect the brain, and improving quality of care for individuals with neurological disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa. The IOM is focusing on data sharing collaboration and data mining. It is examining what is requried to merge industry and academic studies.\r\n\r\nThrough its meetings and workshops the Forum strives to enhance understanding of research and clinical issues associated with the nervous system among the scientific community and the general public, and provide a mechanism to foster partnerships among stakeholders. This project is being co-funded by the Behavioral & Cognitive Sciences Division of the Social, Behavioral, and Economics Directorate, the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET)Division of the Engineering Directorate, and the Information and Intelligent Systems Division of the Computer & Information Science & Engineering Directorate.",
