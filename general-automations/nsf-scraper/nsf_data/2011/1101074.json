 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to develop versatile methods for self-organization of metal nano-architectures where colloidal solutions of metal nanoparticles are assembled on self-organized chemical domains using covalent nanoparticle-substrate interactions.  The assembly process to be developed allows for control of nanoparticle size, composition and shape, number of nanoparticles assembled in a cluster as well as array architecture.  The chemical domain diameter to nanoparticle diameter ratio will be investigated as a means to control the cluster size.  A balance between capillary and double layer forces yields molecular scale separations between nanoparticles in clusters that is important to yield enhanced optical fields.  The inter-particle spacing and cluster size will be varied to tune resonances and local enhancement of optical fields. Models for investigating local and collective resonances in clustered or arrayed nanoparticles will be developed, including the local density of states, and extinction and absorption coefficients. \r\n\r\nNone of the standard nanoscale lithographic techniques such as focused ion-beam, electron beam and nano-imprint lithography, are easily translated into large-area production that is needed to transform proof of concepts into commercial products. In contrast, guided self-organization is designed here to be inexpensive and scalable to large-area production. Facile, large-area synthesis of ordered arrays of metal nanostructures will enable or enhance performance in several critical technologies.  Partnerships with industrial and government laboratories are included to test metal nanosystems in sensor, laser and detector applications.  For example, plasmonic nanoparticle clusters will be used to lower detection limits in optical based sensors that is needed in both biomedical applications and in explosive agent detection.  The research program will also directly contribute to the education of graduate and undergraduate students through hands-on laboratory experience in a field that is at the forefront of modern research. Outreach activities will include integrating local high school students in research activities to increase science, technology, engineering, and math enrollment of underrepresented groups.",

The materials and low processing temperatures bring this system into the realm of economic feasibility for medical diagnostic applications. \n \nBroader Impact:  During the funding period, research activities have provided interdisciplinary training for graduate, undergraduate and high school students.  Three students have completed PhD degrees and undergraduate students, including three students that are underrepresented minorities in STEM, received advanced training.   High school outreach activities included a partnership with Don Bosco Technical High School where students visited the UC Irvine campus on an annual basis.  Don Bosco is a primarily Hispanic serving high school and these visits are designed to pique students\u00c6 interest in STEM undergraduate education.  Exposure to state of the art research facilities in nanoscience fabrication and characterization led to several Don Bosco students to enroll as undergraduate in engineering programs at UC Irvine.  Overall education activities during the project period served to broaden diversity in science and engineering. \n \nIn the sector of medical diagnostic, there is an emerging set of data showing that volatile metabolites provide a signature of infectious and disease states. For instance, biomarkers for cystic fibrosis have been found in patients\u00c6 saliva and lung cancer biomarkers have been found in a patient\u00c6s breath.  A facile method with trace detection limits would benefit not only diagnosis but also point-of-care evaluations.   The advances in understanding of how to generate optical sensors using low cost manufacturing methods allow for a new set of diagnostic devices allowing for better treatment of chronically ill patients. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Regina Ragan"
