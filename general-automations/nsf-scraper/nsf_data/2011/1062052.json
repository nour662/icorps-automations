 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animal movements result from a balance of many different forces, and are the product of neural outputs\r\nacting on muscles driving a mechanically complex body in an unpredictable environment. Locomotion\r\nemerges from interactions within and among these neural, sensory and motor systems and the external\r\nenvironment. In order to achieve an integrated understanding of locomotion, even in very simple model\r\norganisms, interdisciplinary approaches that combine experiments, mathematical and computational models,\r\nand robotic models are necessary. This Research Coordination Network on the Neuromechanics and\r\nDynamics of Locomotion will catalyze interactions and communication between researchers from diverse\r\nbackgrounds whose combined expertise will lead to significant progress in uncovering the fundamental\r\nprocesses of this complex system. We will use our successes in understanding the swimming behavior of\r\nlamprey through coordinated neural and mechanical studies (experimental, robotic and computational) as\r\na model for the RCN?s approach to interdisciplinary collaborations. The RCN will provide a framework\r\nthat facilitates these collaborations through planned activities that include exchange visits of graduate\r\nstudents and postdoctoral fellows among RCN laboratories, an annual Winter Workshop on Locomotion,\r\nvisits among members of the RCN network, organization of minisyposia at national meetings, and\r\nmaintenance of a locomotion website.\r\n\r\nOne ideal in neuroscience is to understand how the nervous system creates a complete behavior. Locomotion\r\nis a prime example of such a complex behavior. Relationships among neuronal and motoneuronal\r\nactivities, and the resulting dynamic muscle forces would need to be deduced. One would then describe\r\nhow muscle forces combine with the mechanics of the organism in its environment. Finally, the integration\r\nof sensory feedback into movement control must be described. The neuromechanics and dynamics\r\nof locomotion present a rich array of challenges to biologists, mathematicians, engineers and computational\r\nscientists. This RCN will support graduate students and postdocs to visit a laboratory outside their\r\nown discipline, where they can develop a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between theory,\r\ncomputation, and experiment. Members of the steering committee have demonstrated commitment to this\r\nmodel of training, and have excellent track-records in the mentoring of students, ranging from directing\r\nundergraduate research, directing MS and Ph.D. theses, and serving as advisors to postdoctoral students.\r\nThis RCN will serve as a means to increase the number of US women and minorities in scientific research.",
