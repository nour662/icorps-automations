 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing availability of new sequencing technologies has dramatically reduced the cost of obtaining genomic data from biological threats. Similarly, the recent development of new technologies for the analysis of chemical samples, such as gas chromotography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromotography-multi-stage mass spectrometry (LC-MSn), has increased the availability and complexity of data on chemical threats. This deluge of information creates the need and the opportunity for the mathematical sciences community to develop technology for controlling and reducing the threat from biological and chemical attacks.  This proposal aims at securing funding for the participation of student and postdoctoral researchers in two DTRA/NSF algorithms workshops.  The first one of these workshops will be held in Boston, between June 6 and June 10, 2011, and the second will be held during the summer of 2012.  The purpose of these workshops is to provide a forum for scientists and mathematicians that have interest in this NSF/DTRA sponsored program to share their results, and to foster interaction between experts in innovative algorithm development and experts in the sensor R&D community.\r\n\r\nThe Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have recently formed a partnership to support the development of the next generation of mathematical and statistical algorithms for the detection of chemical and biological threats. The result is a new program within the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS), which is called \"ATD: Algorithms for Threat Detection\". This proposal seeks to secure travel support for students and postdoctoral researchers who will participate in the 2011 and 2012 NSF/DTRA Algorithms Workshops. Providing this type of funding is critical for the training of the next generation of mathematical scientists.  In particular, by providing opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers to be exposed to problems of chemical and biological threat detection, the NSF creates incentives for junior researchers (and specially those from underrepresented groups) to focus on this important and timely area of research.",
