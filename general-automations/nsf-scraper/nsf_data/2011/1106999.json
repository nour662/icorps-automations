 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies combinatorial, probabilistic and analytic concepts, theorems and algorithms for analyzing stochastic models coming from social choice theory, from the theory of biological networks and from theoretical computer science.\r\n\r\nThe proposal aims to provide rigorous models answering questions from molecular biology, from the theory of voting and from theoretical computer science. Some of the biologically motivated problems we study include:  Which biological networks can be reconstructed from genetic data? How can they be efficiently reconstructed? \r\nWhat genealogical relations between individuals can be recovered from their genomes in an efficient manner?  In the theory of voting the questions we address focus on minimizing the ability to manipulate voting and ranking methods and to increase their robustness against voting errors.",
