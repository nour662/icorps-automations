 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continuing support for a program of research for the High Energy Physics (HEP) group at the University of Chicago. The HEP group participates in the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland, the CDF experiment at Fermilab, and the Double Chooz experiment at the Chooz Nuclear Power Station in northern France, as well as performing R&D in accelerator physics and the development of photo-detectors with picosecond resolution. In the tradition of the group, participation in each experiment involves construction of major subsystems and electronics and leadership roles in the physics analysis and administration of the experiment. The ATLAS experiment is the major effort of the group. During the grant period the group will be heavily involved in physics analysis, initially of the standard model, but then on searches for new physics phenomena; also, the start of construction for the FasTraKer (FTK ) upgrade is expected to begin. The current suite of analysis topics was chosen to be appropriate to early operation of the experiment. In addition to testing the performance of the detector and its data analysis tools, they provide the potential for seeing new phenomena against the background of well understood physics.  Physics analysis using CDF data will continue, albeit at a reduced level.  In Double Chooz the group will install both outer veto (OV) systems in the far and near experiment halls, in France. After installation it will start commissioning the detectors. Simulation studies directed to the separation of candidate events from background will be carried out. Algorithms for neutrino detection events will be investigated as will algorithms to identify and reconstruct muons passing through the OV detector. Further effects will be studied as part of the program to produce a measured value or upper limit on theta-13. The broader impact reach of the group includes working with undergraduate and graduate students on research problems, mentoring of postdocs and graduate students, continued commitment to outreach by continuing its traditional participation in the Chicago Public Schools and the Illinois Math and Science Academy, the creation of two new outreach and educational programs for disadvantaged children from urban areas and extending technologies developed in its research to other fields.",

The NSF support permitted this large group to take influential roles in three cutting-edge international experiments, and also to develop instrumentation to improve these existing experiments and enable better future experiments. Our group has a long history of outreach activity, and we have taken great pleasure in explaining our research to the public through special lectures, summer courses, and ad hoc conferences.  \nOur group on the ATLAS experiment studies collisions of protons at the highest energy particle accelerator in the world &ndash; the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. ATLAS, together with its competitor CMS, are _the_ cutting edge experiments in particle physics giving us. The goal of these experiments is to measure the debris of the proton collisions and search for evidence of new particles that are not currently in our theory (called the \"Standard Model\" &ndash; SM). At the same time, we test the SM at ever-higher precision. In 2012 the LHC experiments had their major breakthrough in the discovery of the Higgs Boson, a particle suggested 30 years ago by theorists, but not seen experimentally until ATLAS and CMS saw evidence for it.  Our Chicago group played an important role in this discovery, as well as in about a dozen other measurements of the SM theory and several searches for other particles suggested by theorists (such as the particle that might explain gravity, or a class of particles that might account for the \"dark matter\" of the universe).\nThe precursor to ATLAS was the CDF experiment at Fermilab, which studied proton collisions before the LHC was built. Even though the Fermilab energies were too low to see the Higgs Boson, it did make a major discovery of the top-quark. The Chicago group had a significant role in measuring the properties of the top quark and also in searching for the Higgs Boson and other new particles.  Our recent measurements of top at CDF remain the most accurate to date.\nThe \"Double-Chooz\" experiment uses a nuclear power reactor in France to study the properties of an elusive particle called the neutrino. Because they are so difficult to detect, the class of particles known as neutrinos are still rather mysterious and we do not yet have a full theory to explain all their properties.  This experiment, of which a major part was built by the Chicago group, has made a major step by measuring a so-called \"mixing parameter\" of the neutrino; this will help in theory building, possibly even giving understanding to why the universe is comprised of matter but virtually no anti-matter.\nThe Chicago group has played a major role in these experiments, developing and constructing new, cutting edge instrumentation used in the experiments, and with a large number of personnel given leadership positions on these experiments. The development of instrumentation is done with the help of electrical engineers in our Electronics Development Group. We have designed electronics chips capable of faster time measurements than though possibleby industry and have recently developed fast light sensors (microchannel plates) larger and cheaper that those currently available retail. These and other developments from our physics projects are of use in industry, especially medical imaging. The fast-timing electronics will significantly improve PET imaging.\nOur group takes pride in producing significant outreach to the general public, college students, and underrepresented groups.  Every summer we host an electronics camp for middle school students where they learn how t..."
