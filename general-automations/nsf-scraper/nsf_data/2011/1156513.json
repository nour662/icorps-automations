 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal involves the focused effort by this team to translate the results of current NSF funded research on visible light photocatalysts for water remediation (nanogrids) into actual products for the remediation market.  Nanogrids -i.e. miniaturized \"fishing nets\"-like self-supported mats that float on water- of these nanocatalysts rapidly decompose crude oil and other contaminants using solar irradiation, and fast and at low cost turn them into water, carbon dioxide, and biodegradable organics. Therefore, these nanogrids may clean oil spills effectively, whether these are near the seashore or in the middle of the ocean; at a refinery, or at a water cleaning facility. The proposed project addresses the scalability of the synthesis method used for the nanogrids and aims to produce a prototype of the nanogrids technology for use in remediating oil pollution.  The photocatalytic nanogrids tehnology that this team are developing involve green photochemistry; uses the whole spectrum of the solar irradiation (unlike the industrial catalysts that respond to UV-light only) thus providing significantly improved catalytic efficiency; it responds to various types of contaminants (thus enabling diverse uses); and offers complete oxidation of hydrocarbons into ecofriendly species. The potential flexibility of process conditions (contact time with pollutant, floatability, recovery, reuse), the fact that it responds to an urgent need for economic water remediation technologies, and its potential to go from the lab to the marketplace within months, make the nanogrids a breakthrough nanotechnology worth exploring further towards commercialization. \r\n\r\nOil derivatives are among the most dangerous compounds for the environment. The photocatalytic nanogrids technology provides a means to contain and clean oil contamination, especially in water, in a most cost-effective and ecofriendly manner. While current photocatalysts are activated by only about 2% of the solar irradiance, the nanogrids respond to radiation from the full solar spectrum. And solar power is free. Apart from water remediation, immediate uses of the nanogrids technology are envisioned in filtration, as well as in biomedical and pharmaceutical industries. Scaling-up the nanomanufacturing process will provide significant benefits in terms of reducing the cost and increasing the availability of the nanogrids to be used in actual commercial products. Commercializing this technology will create new jobs, will provide the opportunity to train the workforce in using nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing to make real and versatile market products, and it will benefit the environment and the human welfare.",
