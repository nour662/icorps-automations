 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms program of the Division of Chemistry, is an interdisciplinary study that seeks to bridge the gap between experimental methodology utilizing bulk material and results obtained through theoretical studies utilizing modern computational techniques. Professor Joel Olson, along with Professors Mark J. Novak and J. Clayton Baum will utilize scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) along with tunneling spectroscopies to study the electronic and geometric properties of potent anti-parasitical alkaloids that have displayed efficacy against a wide range of diseases that include malaria and tuberculosis. Because STM allows for the analyses of single molecules at the sub-molecular level, we are no longer constrained by the use of bulk material to gain insight into mechanism(s) of interaction of these anti-parasitical compounds with potential receptors at the molecular level.\r\n\r\nThis project also seeks to determine if sub-molecular STM data can be used to refine and develop quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models; this may dramatically change how QSAR is used to rationally design important chemical agents, from medicinal compounds to catalysts.  In addition, the STM data generated in this project will be used to assess the validity of density functional theory (DFT) modeling which is currently being used as a theoretical framework in which to study the anti-parasitical compounds in this work.  \r\n\r\nThis award will also provide valuable support to our strong \"hands-on\" undergraduate research program here at Florida Tech.  As early as their freshman year, our undergraduate students join a research group and get training to operate state-of-the-art instrumentation and actively work with the faculty and graduate students on various research projects. These students also get training in the communication and presentation of science, and often present their results as active participants at scientific conferences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this project was to develop a new method to help design new molecules for specific purposes, a goal which the research team successfully accomplished.  The molecules studied for this project were anti-malarial compounds known as tryptanthrins (see Figure 1).\n\nTryptanthrin is found naturally in medicinal plants that have been used since antiquity as folk remedies for parasitic and bacterial infections.  We analyzed these molecules with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), which is able to provide images of these molecules at the sub-molecular and atomic scales.  An STM image of a single tryptanthrin molecule is shown in Figure 2(a).  STM images show where the electronic orbitals of the molecules exist, and are in good agreement with quantum theory; a theoretical electron orbital is shown in Figure 2(b) for comparison.\n\nThe research team was also able to use the STM to measure and map the energy barriers of the electrons across the molecules using a technique called barrier height tunneling spectroscopy.  Figure 3 shows a topographical image of a single molecule of a tryptanthrin analog (a) and its associated energy barrier map (b).\n\nThe experimental results shown above were crucial for the next step of the project, namely to develop a new theoretical and computational method (based on quantum mechanics) for simulating exactly the sorts of energy barriers we measured with the STM.  The research team used the experimental STM barrier energy map to guide us in the development of the computational method.  A simulated computational image is shown in Figure 4(a).  Figure 4(b) shows a masked experimental barrier map for comparison.  As can be seen from Figure 4, we were able to very accurately simulate the experimental results.\n\nThe research team then used the computational simulation to analyze an entire series of tryptanthrin molecules that had been tested against the organism that causes malaria.  Our hope was to see if we could identify a portion of the molecule that correlates with the anti-malarial activity.  We tested seventeen different portions of the molecule versus anti-malarial activity.  These portions were associated with individual lobes of the quantum electron states of the molecules.  We found one portion that did show a strong correlation with anti-malarial activity.  The important portion is labeled a3* in Figure 2(b).\n\nIf our model is correct, then we have identified the critical location in tryptanthrin molecules for their anti-malarial behavior.  But more importantly, if it is borne out that this new method is able to predict molecular behavior, then we have discovered an important new method for designing molecules for useful applications, which could include pharmaceuticals, catalysts, pesticides, herbicides, odorants, and energetic materials, to name a few.  Thus the results of this project have the potential to significantly improve our lives via specific design of chemical compounds.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joel A Olson"
