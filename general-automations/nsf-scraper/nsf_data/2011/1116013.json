 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communication technologies have taken a central role in daily life, business, government, industry, and social interactions over recent decades.  Technology is used not only to allow people to communicate with each other from across the world but to allow machines to interact automatically---processing internet search queries, managing warehouse inventory, forecasting severe weather, updating computer software, and controlling complex systems such as a network of electric power stations.  The need for secure communication has increased accordingly.  Currently, technology is designed around the concept that a secure or private communication signal must be invisible to the outside world unless the security is compromised.  This matches the Hollywood image of a top-secret classified conversation taking place over a \"secure line.\"  However, in many emerging applications where machines transmit important  information signals to each other, a less expensive type of privacy is adequate---one that simply distorts the view of the signal for any unintended eavesdroppers to the point where they cannot use the information to disrupt the system.  This research involves a mathematical analysis of the secrecy of signals.  The investigators derive fundamental minimum requirements to protect the communication of signals.\r\n\r\nThis research uses information theory to provide a theoretical foundation for secrecy of signals, using secret keys and physical layer security.  However, this work differs from previous theoretical work in a number of ways.  One key difference is that metrics for secrecy based on abstract or intangible mathematical quantities are omitted.  Instead, secrecy is evaluated based on what an adversary would be able to do with information gleaned from the system.  This research is theoretical and broad, yet the novelty of the results bring new insights to applied cryptography.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSecure communication is important for modern technology, but it comes at a cost of extra computation, lower transmission rates, or extra resources needed to generate secret keys.  This project emphasizes that the decision to apply secure encoding to an information signal need not be binary.  It is possible to transmit a signal with partial security at a lesser cost.\n\nIn the context of cryptography, the level of security would usually indicate how much time and effort (computer cycles) it would take to unlock the secure information.  The information theory approach, as this project adopts, measures the level of security by what can be protected no matter how long or hard the adversary works.  Unlike previous work in the field, this project measures the level of protection of a signal by the quality (hopefully lack thereof) of an adversary's best possible reproduction of the signal.  In other words, we prove what an adversary cannot do with the leaked information.  Prior work in information theory uses a mathematical quantity to measure information leakage that does not translate directly to a meaningful applications.\n\nThis project has been successful in solving the fundamental limits of secure encoding of a single source in this framework.  This means that we have discovered the optimal encoding technique, which is in fact quite different from previous encoding techniques for digital communication and compression.  We have also made progress in settings involving multiple correlated information signals and how to deal with noise in the transmission.\n\nThe technology developed by this project, either presently or through future developments that build on this theory, will play a role in secure communication for the long-term future.  These results are not dependent on the current state-of-the-art technology.  They provide principles that are fundamental.\n\nThis project also produced many new tools that are finding broad application in other areas of information theory.  As part of this project, using these tools, new discoveries have been made about optimal encoding for the purposes of producing a secure communication link via channel noise, generating secret key from correlated signals, and compressing an information signal.\n\nThis project also had other components not related to secure encoding.  In particular, voting theory, social networks, and recommendation systems were also subjects of study.  Algorithms were studied and developed for the purpose of giving recommendations to groups in a social network based on their preferences and those of their peers, or for allowing groups to aggregate their opinions by passing messages locally to those they are connected to.  The work concerning voting theory gave new evidence that well-known problems that plagues voting system, the fact that the vote outcome can be effected by non-winning candidates, or that voters often have an inceptive to not vote their true preferences, can be almost entirely eliminated by using a Condorcet method to decide the winner.\n\nThis project has helped support the graduate research of seven students, including two women.  Two of them completed their Ph.D degrees during this project.  Most of them have traveled internationally to speak about the findings of the research.  Many publications have resulted from this work.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul W Cuff"
