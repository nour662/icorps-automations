 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to improve the mathematical models used to understand the spread of vector-borne diseases such as the recent Rift Valley Fever (RVF) epidemics in Africa, the dengue fever (DENV) outbreaks in South America (and Florida), and the continued spread of West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States.  Because of the importance of the environment and weather on mosquito-borne epidemics, existing models will be extended to be reactive to environmental changes. For mosquito-borne diseases spread by viruses, there is the possibility that an infected mother can transmit the virus to her eggs and her offspring be born infected.  Therefore, vertical transmission will also be included in the modeling and a range of parameters will be identified to determine when vertical transmission is important.  These models are analyzed, validated on field data, and undergo a full uncertainty quantification analysis. \r\n  \r\nMathematical models based on the underlying transmission mechanisms of the disease can help the public health community understand and anticipate the spread of an epidemic and evaluate the potential effectiveness of different approaches for bringing an epidemic under control.  The goal is to develop mathematical models to improve our understanding of the essential relationships between the biological, environmental, and mitigation mechanisms that influence the spread of vector-borne diseases.  Such models can be used to assess the relative impact of different mitigation efforts to control the spread of an epidemic; saving time, resources, and lives.",

We chose vector-borne diseases because the urgency in providing timely guidance to the global eradication campaign against malaria and the ongoing RFV epidemics in Kenya, South Africa, and Madagascar.   In addition to these epidemics, we extended our model to better understand, and predict, the spread of dengue fever and chikungunya in the Americas.\n\nMost previous mosquito-borne viral disease models ignored the role of vertical transmission where an infected adult female mosquito can pass on the infection to her offspring.   Vertical transmission can be important for a disease to establish itself and survive long dry seasons when there are no adult mosquitoes.  We applied our new model to RVF transmission in cattle and mosquitoes in an African environment with both wet and dry seasons.  The model predicts that the epidemic is most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate and the infectivity of hosts to vectors.  Numerical simulations showed that even with low equilibrium prevalence, increases in mosquito densities through higher rainfall, in the presence of vertical transmission, can result in large epidemics. This suggests that vertical transmission is an important factor in the size and persistence of RVF epidemics.\n\nOur research was in close collaboration with vector-borne disease epidemiologists and public health scientists.  The new model produces better diseases forecasts and, as these models continue to improve, they hold the promise of helping guide public health workers to help set mitigation priorities, saving time, resources, and lives.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/08/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James M Hyman"
