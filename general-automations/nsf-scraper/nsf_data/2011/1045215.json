 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nUntil recently, wetted soils in the Dry Valleys were generally only found adjacent to streams and lakes. Since the warm austral summer of 2002, numerous ?wet spots? have been observed far from shorelines on relatively flat valley floor locations and as downslope fingers of flow on valley walls. The source of the water to wet these soils is unclear, as is the spatial and temporal pattern of occurrence from year to year. Their significance is potentially great as enhanced soil moisture may change the thermodynamics, hydrology, and erosion rate of surface soils, and facilitate transport of materials that had previously been stable. These changes to the soil active layer could significantly modify permafrost and ground ice stability within the Dry Valleys. The PIs seek to investigate these changes to address two competing hypotheses: that the source of water to these ?wet spots? is ground ice melt and that the source of this water is snowmelt. The PIs will document the spatiotemporal dynamics of these wet areas using high frequency remote sensing data from Quickbird and Wordview satellites to document the occurrence, dimensions, and growth of wet spots during the 2010-\u00ad11 and 2011-\u00ad12 austral summers. They will test their hypotheses by determining whether wet spots recur in the same locations in each season, and they will compare present to past distribution using archived imagery. They will also determine whether spatial snow accumulation patterns and temporal ablation patterns are coincident with wet spot formation. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nOne graduate student will be trained on this project. Findings will be reported at scientific meetings and published in peer reviewed journals. They will also develop a teaching module on remote sensing applications to hydrology for the Modular Curriculum for Hydrologic Advancement and an innovative prototype project designed to leverage public participation in mapping wet spots and snow patches across the Dry Valleys through the use of social media and mobile computing applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was focused on determining the distribution of water across the polar desert landscape of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica.  The Dry Valleys are a very dry and cold landscape, but have active streams and open (ice-free) lake margins during the austral summer.  Snow collects across this landscape in the winter in patches that generally range in size from 1 to 10's of square meters.  Thus, annual snow does not blanket this landscape. Wet soils are commonly found adjacent to streams and lakes.  However, wetted soils very distant from lakes and streams have been observed in the Dry Valleys over the past decade from researchers working in these valleys.  Several open questions then include: What is the water source for these soils far from streams and lakes (e.g., snow, glacier ice, or permafrost thaw)?  Have the extent or number of wet patches increased over the past decade?\n\nThe goals of this project were to: 1) determine whether high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery (i.e., satellite imagery from specific satellites that produce imagery with ~60cm resolution on the ground) could be used to identify wetted soils in the polar desert of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, and if so, 2) use the developed methodology/techniques to determine whether the number or areal coverage of wetted soils had changed through time, and 3) evaluate the potential sources of water to these wetted soils is.\n\nCareful evaluation of the available high-resolution remote sensing imagery collected and made available since 2008 allowed us to identify and quantify the location and size of wet soil patches across the landscape.  The number and total areal coverage was variable across three austral summers, but there is no clear trend of increasing number or areal coverage of wet soils through time.  Our findings indicate that less than 2% of the ice-free landscape are wet at any one time.  Finally, we also determined, by assessing the potential upslope distributions of snow and ice, that the most likely source of water to these wet soils is the seasonal snow patches. \n\nOne graduate student was trained on this project, and our group has made several presentations of this research at scientific conferences.  At the moment,ne peer-reviewed paper is conditionally accepted for publication (pending revisions), and another has been prepared that will be submitted to a journal subsequent to the first being accepted.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/02/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael N Gooseff"
