 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Old Dominion University and the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.   The goal of the REU site is to continue exposing eight undergraduates per year to the sense of excitement and accomplishment that accompanies independent research and to provide information and contacts that improve their chances of choosing scientific careers. In rigorously peer-reviewed projects in Jefferson Lab's state-of-the-art facilities (an environment with a longstanding tradition of mentoring and nurturing students) selected students will be guided to make meaningful contributions to advances in superconducting RF structures, novel accelerator design, and particle detectors. The students will interact with a broad range of experts, namely, ODU faculty, graduate students and post-docs and Jefferson Lab staff scientists and engineers as well as with a large group of other undergraduates. A seminar series tailored for the undergraduate students and the normal colloquia and seminars, which regularly occur at Jefferson Lab, will complement the research program. The students will be trained in both written and oral presentations of their research work because effective communication is critical for successful careers. The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",

The program's goal is to encourage and excite students into pursuing scientific careers in Nuclear and Accelerator Physics; we strive to place between 60 and 80 percent of the students in accelerator physics, while adhering to student interests.\n\nODU has had a large presence at Jefferson Lab in Experimental and Theoretical Nuclear Physics  since the lab's inception.  During the last decade, this association expanded into the field of Accelerator Physics.  While Nuclear Physics is a well-known field to undergraduates, Accelerator Physics remains somewhat unknown, though accelerators have increasingly become important research tools in biology, medicine, and materials, to name just a few.  The growth of accelerators for research and for applications such as medical diagnostics and treatment resulted in a demand for accelerator scientists nationally and world-wide. Additionally, Accelerator Physics is inherently inter-disciplinary and offers a variety of scientific and engineering career choices to the students. In addition to being a unique Nuclear Physics facility, Jefferson Lab is a world leader in both Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) accelerator technology and high current polarized electron sources. SRF technology is becoming the choice for many contemplated light sources and the International linear Collider.  Our REU program makes students not only aware of these exciting possibilities but prepares them to take advantage of them.\n\nOur REU students participate in ongoing leading edge projects in both Nuclear and Accelerator Physics. They receive safety training relevant to their projects, attend a seminar series (including a seminar on ethics in research), presented by leading scientists, tailored specifically for their level, and have access to excellent facilities. While the students have primary mentors, they work as a part of a team (scientists, engineers, technicians, post-docs and graduate students) and are thus mentored by the team. The students are required to write a paper at the end of their term, prepare and present a poster at the poster session, and orally present their research.  The students receive training in all these aspects of scientific communication. Planned recreational and social activities provide a break from the busy research work. We encourage our students to participate in undergraduate gatherings.\n\nOver the past three years (2011-2013), 24 students participated in the ODU/Jefferson Lab REU program (6 female students, 3 under-represented minority students  and one injured veteran). Of the sixteen 2011-2012 students, 10 are in graduates school, while 5 are continuing as undergraduate students. (We were unable to track one student). Ten of our students have participated in the Conference Experience for Undergraduates organized as part of the fall Division of Nuclear Physics meeting and one of the students.  Alyssa Henderson (UVa) was also invited to participate in Conference of Research Experience for Undergraduate Student Scholarship in Arlington, VA. We invite promising students to continue working with their mentors during the academic year, provided they have time to do so. Presently, three students have taken advantage of this opportunity and one student Matthew Brown (2012, Arizona State U.) presented the research work he has been continuing with his mentor at CEU2013. We try to give our students international exposure if we can. One of our students Justin Dolph (2011, Bridgewater College, Va), presented a poster at the International Particle Accelerator Conference in 2011. (IP..."
