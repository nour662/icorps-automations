 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brigham Young University (BYU) proposes to join the existing Center for e-Design that is currently comprised of Virginia Tech (lead), the University of Central Florida, the University of Massachusetts, and Carnegie Mellon University. \r\n\r\nBYU will complement the research umbrella by investigating, modifying, and prototyping, at kernel levels, new architectures for networked multi-user computer-aided applications (v-CAx). The new institution will add strategically to Center goals, because of its strong history in applications of modern CAx software. Faculty from various disciplines at BYU will be involved because of the scope of problems that must be addressed in a multi-user, architectural CAx environment. \r\n\r\nThe new university brings cultural diversity to the research that will be demanded by research prototypes. BYU will extend and integrate CAx applications through API libraries, computer OS architectures, network security, and business team conflict resolution. BYU has strong relationships with several international institutions that have expertise in gaming technologies. BYU's strong dependence on both undergraduate and graduate students for development and testing, will provide students a rich educational experience. The university also plans to involve K-12 and post K-12 levels in the Center.",
