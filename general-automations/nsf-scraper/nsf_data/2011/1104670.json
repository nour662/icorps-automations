The first project will study (joint with A. Ott,\r\nC. Woodward and F. Ziltener) the construction of gauged\r\nGromov-Witten invariants on punctured surfaces with fixed\r\nholonomies. The PI will also investigate the particular case of\r\ntoric actions on affine complex spaces. Our second project is on\r\nthe study of the invariance of gauged Gromov-Witten potentials\r\nfor toric actions on affine spaces.  We will use established\r\nformulae to show that for Calabi-Yau wall-crossing the gauged\r\nGromov-Witten potentials do not change.  After this project is\r\nfinished we will study the behaviour of the potential in the\r\nnon-toric case. This will be done jointly with C. Woodward.  Our\r\nthird proposed activity, joint with H. Iritani, will explain the\r\nrelation between Seidel elements and Mirror Transformations for\r\nnef toric non-singular projective varieties. We will then try to\r\napply our methods to the non-nef case. Our last proposed project\r\nwith A. Cotton-Clay will attempt to resolve a conjecture due to\r\nM. Thaddeus relating Floer cohomology for symplectomorphisms and\r\norbifold (stacky) cohomology for global quotients by finite\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nOur research will advance the interplay of several subjects in\r\nmathematics and physics where symmetries play a relevant\r\nrole. The first project in this grant will advance the\r\nunderstanding and applications of symplectic geometry and gauge\r\ntheory (the modern language of elementary particle physics) into\r\nphysical theories called \"gauged sigma models\".  Our other\r\nprojects will provide a different approach to the Mirror Symmetry\r\nphenomena using symplectic geometry invariants.",
