 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trabecular bone is the sponge-like bone tissue present in the internal regions of bone near joints and in the vertebral centrum.  It has long been known that trabecular bone structure is aligned with mechanical stresses caused by habitual activities but it remains unclear how such alignment occurs.  The research goals of this project are to: 1) establish methods to determine the spatial relationship between trabecular bone tissue stress/stain and bone formation following a single bout of cyclic compressive loading; and 2) determine if the local population of osteocytes (a type of bone cell believed to be responsible for sensing mechanical stimuli) influences the spatial relationship between tissue stress/strain and bone formation.  In this project osteocyte populations are determined by detecting the microscopic holes where osteocytes reside within bone tissue.  \r\n\r\nTrabecular bone is a major structural component in regions of the skeleton prone to osteoporosis-related fractures (hip, wrist, spine) and understanding how mechanical stimuli influence trabecular bone structure has the potential to improve fracture risk assessment and fracture risk prevention strategies.  The methods generated in the work will enhance teaching through integration into a graduate course entitled \"Mechanics of Bone.\"  Additionally, as part of this project the investigators will contribute to an annual workshop targeted to undergraduates and graduate students from an under-represented group with the goal of helping prepare the students for graduate school and careers in science and engineering.  The scientific work in the project will be disseminated through presentations at scientific conferences and publications in scientific journals.",
