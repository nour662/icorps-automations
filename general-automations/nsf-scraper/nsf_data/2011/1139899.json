 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decomposing leaves are an important source of energy and nutrients in many streams. Factors that control the rate of leaf decomposition in streams may vary between tropical and temperate regions. For example, recent studies suggest that bacteria and fungi may be more important to leaf breakdown in tropical streams, while aquatic insects may be more important in temperate streams. The impacts of aquatic insects on leaf decay will be assessed in headwater streams in Puerto Rico and in North Carolina.  Microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) will be characterized on decaying leaf material from each site, and the chemical composition of litter will be measured as it decays. This study is part of a larger effort to address fundamental differences in stream ecosystem processes between temperate and tropical regions. \r\nBroader impacts of the project will include advancement of the research career of an underrepresented minority scientist, enhancement of collaborations between the Principal Investigator and established researchers at two long term research sites, and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students by the Principal Investigator.",
