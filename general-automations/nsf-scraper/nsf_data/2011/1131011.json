Ani Hsieh from Drexel University and Dr. Rafael Fierro from the University of New Mexico propose to organize an International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program with Brazilian collaborators Dr. Luiz Chaimowicz and Dr. Mario Campos both from the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to develop a multi-faceted approach to study multi-robot system for reliable execution of large scale cooperative tasks.  The PIs will focus on four main topics related to multi-robot systems and cooperative control: (a) execution of complex task using robot swarms; (b) distributed autonomous assembly; (c) ensemble synthesis of distributed coordination strategies; and (d) intentional sensing via prioritized detection and active learning.  \r\n\r\nThis three-year IRES program also provides undergraduate and graduate students with a unique opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary and international research on the design of multi-robot systems integrating theory and hardware.  The students will also gain new perspectives on the use of autonomous robots to accomplish coordinated tasks within a complex environment and with limited resources.\r\n\r\nThis award is jointly funded by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems of the NSF Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering and the Office of International Science and Engineering.",

The technical  focus of the collaboration is centered around the design of robust  multi-robot coordination strategies for execution of large scale  cooperative tasks.  Advances in embedded processor and sensor technology  in the last thirty years have accelerate the demand for teams of robots  in various application domains. Multi-agent robotic systems are  particularly well-suited to execute tasks that cover wide geographic  ranges, require significant parallelization, and/or depend capabilities that  are varied in both quantity and difficulty. Example applications  include littoral exploration and surveillance, rainforest health  monitoring, autonomous transportation systems, warehouse automation, and  hazardous waste clean-up.\n\nThe PIs at Drexel University and the  University of New Mexico (UNM) have worked towards establishing a  long-term international research education collaboration with researchers at the VeRLab at the  Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG).  The objective was to provide graduate and  undergraduate students a unique opportunity to work with an  international research team and gain new perspectives on their research  topics.  The project funded four undergraduate students and one graduate student.  Project outcomes include a collaborative localization strategy for small networked robot teams operating in hard to reach spaces, a provably correct distributed strategy that enables a heterogeneous robot team to sort itself into smaller groups of similar sensing and/or mobility capabilities, and a command and control software architecture for coordinating many robot systems.\n\nThe students funded under the project come from diverse backgrounds.  This was the first experience abroad for all student participants.  In addition to broadening their technical horizons, the project has trained and socialized students to work on collaborative international teams.  The program has also been integral in encouraging undergraduate students to pursue careers in research and in STEM.  Three of the four undergraduate students funded by the project are either currently enrolled in a graduate program or actively applying to graduate programs.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/23/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: M.
