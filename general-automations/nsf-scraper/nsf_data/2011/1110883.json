This annual conference is organized jointly by the International Neural Networks Society (INNS) and the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS), with each society taking the lead in alternate years. In recent years, a concerted effort has been made by the organizers to include areas such as computational neuroscience, cognitive science, distributed intelligence, embodied robotics, etc., in the conference. The effort is now being made, through NSF support, to expand this interdisciplinary component by organizing a formal, multi-faceted program within the conference with the theme \"From Brains to Machines.\" This program will bring together researchers from a broad spectrum of areas ranging from neuroscience to biomorphic robotics, and to showcase exciting research in these areas.",
