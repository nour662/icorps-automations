 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Dakota is using environmental awareness to recruit and retain academically talented and financial-needy students to major in biology, chemistry, mathematics or environmental geography.  The teaching of environmental science \"in context\" is being employed to provide engaging and meaningful learning experiences as students progress toward degree attainment and career goals. To achieve the recruitment objectives, 16 students, in two cohorts, are being awarded scholarships with priority given to American Indian students.  To help ensure the retention and progress of these students, the scholarship program also places a premium on intensive advising and student engagement activities, of which participation in an environmental issues seminar series is most prominent.  This scholarship program enables students from underrepresented groups with limited financial opportunities to enter STEM programs. The University of North Dakota has a history of successful work with American Indian students by providing a strong support system; however, these students have minimal involvement in non-medically related majors.  Therefore, this project is taking an important step that is increasing awareness about opportunities in STEM majors and engaging these American Indian students as majors in traditional STEM disciplines.",
