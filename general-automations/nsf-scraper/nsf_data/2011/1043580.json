 "awd_abstract_narration": "The presence of ice ponds from surface melting of glacial ice can be a significant threshold in assessing  the  stability of ice sheets, and their overall response to a warming climate. Snow melt has a much reduced albedo, leading to additional seasonal melting from warming insolation. Water run-off not only contributes to the mass loss of ice sheets directly, but  meltwater reaching the glacial ice bed may lubricate faster flow of ice sheets towards the ocean. Surficial meltwater may also reach the grounding lines of glacial ice through the wedging open of existing crevasses. The occurrence and amount of meltwater refreeze has even been suggested as a paleo proxy of near-surface atmospheric temperature regimes. \r\n\r\nUsing contemporary remote sensing (microwave) satellite assessment of surface melt occurrence and extent, the predictive skill of regional meteorological models  and reanalyses (e.g. WRF, ERA-Interim) to describe the synoptic conditions favourable to surficial melt is to be investigated. Statistical approaches and pattern recognition techniques are argued to provide a context for projecting future ice sheet change. \r\n\r\nThe previous Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC AR4) commented on our lack of understanding of ice-sheet mass balance processes in polar regions and the potential for sea-level change. The IPPC suggested that the forthcoming AR5 efforts highlight regional cryosphere modeling efforts, such as is proposed here.",

This project aimed to learn more about Antarctic surface melting and its relationship to meteorology and climate, then apply that knowledge to estimating potential future changes in melting.\n\nThe best observations of surface melting come from passive microwave instruments on polar-orbiting satellites.  These records are available from mid-1979 to present with daily observations from 1988 onward.  Figure 1 shows examples of melt occurrence (number of days with detected melt as a percentage of the total number of days), each for the southern hemisphere mid-summer month of January.  The central large map shows the 20-year period  1981-2000:  melt is quite frequent at the north end of the warmer Antarctic Peninsula (upper left corner) but relatively rare on the colder continent.

The intramodel analysis examined 19 different (though not entirely independent) GCMs from the CMIP5 archive.
