By utilizing minimal weighted Riesz energy configurations, one can generate sequences of points on surfaces that approximate prescribed density functions on that surface.  Such constructions have a myriad of possible applications to the physical and biological sciences.  Specifically, the team is studying (i) separation and fill-radius estimates for optimal N-point weighted energy configurations; (ii) geometrical properties of optimal and near optimal weighted energy configurations on 2-dimensional surfaces; (iii) algorithms for the fast generation of points distributed on a manifold in accordance with a prescribed density; (iv) properties of greedy energy points; and (v) near optimal discretizations for problems of importance in geophysical applications.\r\n\r\n     The investigator and his colleagues study stable (minimum energy) states of charged particle configurations on curved surfaces and solid materials, especially when such particles are restricted in density or under the influence of external forces.  One goal of the project is to determine efficient numerical methods for the generation of optimal or near optimal distributions of point charges that can be used to help understand the convection of the Earth's mantle, for the modeling of the geodynamo, and to gain a better determination of the Earth's gravitational field.  This project addresses in several different contexts the fundamental problem of how best to convert from analog to digital.",

Such point configurations are of application to, for example,  data sampling methods, best-packing problems, geometric design, and cubature formulae, the study of discretization techniques entails methods from geometric measure theory, potential theory, discrepancy theory, harmonic analysis, complexity theory, number theory, among others.\n\n \n\nThe main outcomes of this project include:\n\n(a) The development of new efficient `low-complexity? algorithms for distributing points on a manifold according to a specified target density.  We prove that these algorithms produce `quasi-uniform? configurations that have both optimal order of separation and covering and that the density of these configurations converge to the target density as the number of points grows to infinity. \n\n(b) The determination of the next order term in the asymptotic expansion (as the number of generating points increases to infinity) for the minimum Riesz s energy of point configurations that are periodic with respect to a d-dimensional lattice in the case that s is less than d.\n\n(c) The proof of the optimality of equally spaced configurations on the circle for the polarization problem of maximizing the minimum value of the potential arising from the points. \n\n(d) Asymptotic estimates for the expected value of local geometrical properties such as minimal point separation and maximal fill-radius (or covering radius) of random N-point configurations on a class of smooth manifolds, including the d-dimensional sphere.\n\n(e) The development of conditions for the solvability of a class of minimum problems for a condenser with touching plates and characterizations of the minimizers in terms of variational inequalities.\n\n(f) New `universal? lower bounds for the energy of point configurations on the d dimensional sphere.
