The project expands the support currently available for low-income students in the sciences and math to improve outcomes in three areas critical to educational advancement: retention to major declaration, academic improvement over time, and degree attainment.  The students are participating in various activities such as intensive advising, study group sessions and tutoring in gateway courses, and a high level of faculty interaction. The project increases the numbers of low-income students who declare a science or math major and go on to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in the targeted fields.",
