The panel will address broadening participation in the mathematical sciences. The panel is comprised of experts who share a deep commitment to ensuring diversity in the mathematical sciences. The primary goal is to discuss ideas for programs that will bring underrepresented students into mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe organizers seek to attract participants from a diverse set of institutions to the workshop. An additional goal is to bring together a broad and diverse group of stakeholders and critical consumers in order to help more mathematical scientists become aware of developments in the discipline. A fundamental understanding is that good intentions are necessary but not sufficient when taking steps toward best practices in mentoring under-represented students.",
