 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this behavioral decision theory project is to develop two tractable models of decision making that weaken standard rationality requirements and accommodate experimental evidence from economics, psychology and marketing.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the project will develop a new model of random choice; a model in which decision makers have coherent objectives but make errors pursuing those objectives. Describing decision making as random has two important advantages: First, it facilitates the measurement of preferences; that is, random choice models allow the econometrician to quantify the intensity of preference via choice frequencies. Second, random choice models facilitate aggregation across different economic agents. The behavior of distinct individuals can be used as evidence for a single model.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this research will introduce a new model of random choice, the generalized attribute selection model (GAR), to address key regularities of choice data found in the experiments in economics, psychology and in the marketing literature. We expect this model to become a useful tool for analyzing consumer behavior.\r\n\r\nBehavioral models that constrain the decision maker's ability to match her behavior to the details of her environment have proven effective in explaining systematic departures from standard models of \"rational choice.\" The second part of the project will introduce a general analytical device for incorporating behavioral elements into competitive economies. Specifically, this research will analyze a dynamic competitive economy with consumers who are limited in their ability to adjust their consumption choices to their specific circumstances. One application of this theory is asset price volatility: we expect to demonstrate that with a given set of fundamentals (preferences and technology), there is more price volatility in a behavioral competitive equilibrium than in a standard competitive equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of this research is to provide a simple model that permits researchers to quantify and measure the impact of behavioral factors in financial markets and enable them to distinguish the effects of these factors from the effects of fundamentals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFaruk Gul and Wolfgang Pesendorfer completed research for two projects on bounded rationality.  Both projects develop new mathematical theories, the first focuses on individual behavior while the second analyzes market outcomes.  The first part of the project is joint with Paulo Natenzon; the second part is joint with Tomasz Strzalecki.\n\nMany experimental studies find that individual choice behavior is stochastic in the sense that the same individual may choose A over B in one instance but B over A in another.  From the analyst?s perspective, the individual?s behavior appears random.  The goal of this research was to develop a model of choice that captures decision makers who have stable preferences but make mistakes.    To accomplish this goal, Gul, Natenzon and Pesendorfer developed a criterion that identifies subjects who have stable preferences even though their choices have a random component.  They show that if subjects satisfy this criterion then their behavior can be captured by a simple formula. They also show that the formula is quite flexible and, therefore, useful for estimating economic choice behavior.  These results were published in Econometrica, a leading economics journal.\n\nThe goal of the second part of the project is to examine the effect of limited cognitive ability (in particular limited attention, memory, and complexity) on market prices.   To accomplish this goal,  Gul, Pesendorfer and Strzalecki build a new model of consumer behavior.  In this model, consumers cannot pay attention to all price changes.  Moreover, consumers must choose how to allocate their limited cognitive resources.   The model assumes that consumers allocate cognitive resources according to the importance of the decision.  Thus, more important decisions receive greater cognitive resources than less important decisions.   The research then examines the effect of these limited cognitive abilities on market outcomes.  Specifically, it shows that limited cognitive resources will exacerbate price volatility.  More precisely, when economic activity is unusually high or low the model predicts extreme price reactions.   These theoretical results provide a new rationale for bubbles and crashes.   The results have been accepted for publication in the American Economic Review, a leading economics journal. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wolfgang Pesendorfer"
