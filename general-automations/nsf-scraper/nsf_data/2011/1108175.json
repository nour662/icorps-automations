Using modern genetic methods to extract DNA from tooth and bone remains from well dated archaeological contexts in combination with radiocarbon-dating and analysis of recent samples, the PIs propose to (1) Provide a detailed temporal-spatial analysis of dog remains across the North American Arctic, (2) analyze the genetic history of prehistoric, contact period, and modern Arctic dogs using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the Y chromosome, and (3) contribute to anthropological and archaeological discussions concerning the movements and cultural interactions of indigenous peoples across the north.",
