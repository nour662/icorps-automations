The scholarship recipients are required to complete a master's degree in Information Science or Telecommunication and Networking with the Security Assured Information Systems (SAIS) track option. Ph.D. students in either program with an Information Assurance concentration are allowed to seek support for the last two years of their studies. The scholarship students benefit from a multidisciplinary educational environment and a strong IA curriculum, which is among the few in the nation that have been certified for all five national IA educational standards set by the Committee on National Systems Security (CNSS). \r\n\r\nScholarship students are provided with appropriate mentoring support throughout their stay at the university. The scholarship program places significant emphasis on the recruitment of underrepresented groups in IA areas through its links with minority serving postsecondary institutions such as the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez, which is a partner in the curriculum development effort, and Lincoln University.",
