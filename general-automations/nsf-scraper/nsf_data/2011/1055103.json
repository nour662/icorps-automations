 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports research at the University of Mississippi on the physics and astrophysics of double star systems containing only black holes and/or neutrons stars (compact binaries). These systems are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves to be detected by present and future gravitational-wave observatories, such as LIGO and and the space-based LISA. One of the main challenges in gravitational-wave data analysis consists in extracting the signal emitted by the system from the noisy detector output. For the extraction to be successful, accurate theoretical \"template\" waveforms of the signal are needed. This research will improve theoretical knowledge of gravitational waveforms from merging compact binaries using a combination of analytical techniques (such as the so-called post-Newtonian approximation and black hole perturbation theory) and numerical simulations. \r\n\r\nThe project will explore the potential of future gravitational-wave observations to test the predictions of general relativity, as opposed to alternative theories of gravity. It will also \"put more astronomy in gravitational-wave astronomy\" by investigating the astrophysical implications of gravitational-wave observations, and by stimulating interactions between the general relativity community and the larger astrophysical community. The award will partially support the training of one student and one postdoc in the highly interdisciplinary field between general relativity, astrophysics and data analysis. It will also support a long-term outreach program to promote scientific literacy and increase enrollment in the physical sciences in Mississippi. Outreach activities will target in particular historically black colleges and universities, as well as universities and community colleges in the Mississippi Delta.",
