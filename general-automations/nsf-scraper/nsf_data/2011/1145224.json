 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory research is a \"latitudinal,\" multi-world study that compares the creative practices of women and their influence in information technology skills acquisition across three different virtual worlds: Second Life, There.com, and OpenSim. The aim of this experimental, potentially transformative research is to better understand the role of creative practice in development of IT skills among women, the motivations and process whereby women develop these skills, and the extent to which they are being parlayed into IT careers.  The study will use qualitative methods, including participant observation and interviews, as well as analysis of player-created digital artifacts, to examine the relationship between creative practice and technical skills acquisition among women in virtual worlds. \r\n\r\nThis exploratory research innovates in three ways: First, it is a latitudinal that makes a significant contribution to the body of research on online cultures in virtual worlds by providing a comparative analysis of cultural practices across multiple \"metaverse\" type worlds. Second, it provides new potentially transformative knowledge about the practices of women in online worlds and their relationship to IT skills acquisition, an understudied area as compared to K-12 girls and STEM skills. Third, it will help us determine the extent to which skills learned in virtual worlds are impacting other aspects of women's lives, such as their general competency and self-efficacy with IT, or their real-world career choices. \r\n\r\nBecause the research seeks to understand the specific motivations of women in virtual worlds to learn IT skills through creative practices, it will provide useful guidelines for expanding female participation in computational fields.  It may also form the foundation for a workforce development strategy among post college-age women who are developing IT skills through informal and peer-learning communities that could be parlayed into real-world careers, a phenomenon that is already occurring emergently within the target group.",

The study included a total of 10 subjects in three virtual worlds: There.com, Second Life and OSGrid, including 6 individuals and two &ldquo;dyads,&rdquo; women who worked together collaboratively. Creative areas ranged from fashion, to animation, to buildings and furniture, to creation of entire virtual world regions. The PI and two grad students conducted participant observation and contextual interviews with the creators within their work spaces and creations. This enabled participants to use their own creations as a jumping off point for conversation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The outcomes of this study have been presented at two conferences, and will be released in an upcoming paper (publication tbd). Some notable findings include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prior skills and experience were relevant: Most of the women had some previous real-world educational or professional background in creative aspects of their pursuits. For instance, one of the fashion designers was a professional seamstress and had a degree in fashion, the other had a degree in costume design; a 3D modeler had extensive experience with crochet; a woman who designed a historically-themed pirate region had a background in resort management and landscape design. Thus, initial creative competency provided a scaffolding for technical competency. </li>\n<li>Learning was goal-directed: The typical pattern was to begin with a desired project or product, and then develop the skills needed for implementation. This approach combines two well-studied learning theories: &ldquo;situated learning,&rdquo; in which knowledge is acquired in the context of a specific goal and &ldquo;constructionist learning,&rdquo; in which learners adopt skills in order to create something.</li>\n<li>Community feedback was a factor: Most women, even women who preferred to work alone, targeted specific communities for their creations. &nbsp;All of the women reported various types of feedback that inspired them to create more, such as renting out space in a region one had designed. One woman said that she had designed her first dress as an experiment, based on a specific &ldquo;meme&rdquo; in her virtual world, but when she saw others walking around wearing it, this inspired her to continue.</li>\n<li>Learning &amp; teaching: The women used a variety of diverse learning techniques, often combining methods. In many cases they would just start creating something and learned from trial and error as they worked, drawing from online tutorials or forums as needed. In other cases they took classes at schools within the virtual worlds they inhabited. Two of the women in particular were heavily involved in teaching. One in particular had learned her skills this way and wanted to give back. Another women posted questions on a forum for a particularly challenging technical task she was taking on. In all cases, the impetus to learn was the derived from a desired project the woman wanted to complete.</li>\n<li>Professionalization: The phenomenon of professionalization, which we identified in prior studies, is when virtual world creators begin making real-world money via their creations. Most virtual worlds have virtual currency, and many allow for real-world currency exchange. In this study we found the extent of professionalization varied. In some cases, players did not really look to make a profit from their creations; they were simply satisfied by making things, and in particular, making things for a particular community. Some of the women supported their virtual world expenditures with their virtual world income, thus breaking even; others were able to do this as well as earning a portion their real-world income from their creations. In one of the dyads, one of the women actually paid cash to the other, regularly sending her checks through the mail.</li>\n<li>A new cottage industry is born: One of the most interesting thing about this study is the extent to which virtual world creative practice is emerging as a new cottage industry. About half the women in the study worked at home or did not work at all; the other half had some kind of regular full- or part-time job.
