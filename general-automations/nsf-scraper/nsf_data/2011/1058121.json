 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, and the Solid State Materials Chemistry Program of the Division of Materials Research, Professor C. Michael Elliott and his research group at Colorado State University will explore the relationships between molecular structure in a series zero-valent metal-bipyridyl complexes, and the electronic work function of films prepared from these complexes. Ligands based on the bipyridyl group can be easily modified, which in turn allows for tunability of the overall electronic structure of the metal complex, and ultimately the thin films made from these complexes.  The synthesis, spectral and electrochemical characterizations, and development of thin film deposition procedures will be done in the Elliott laboratory at CSU.  Work function measurements would be done in collaboration with Professor Bruce Parkinson of the University of Wyoming.  The potential application of these metal complex films in light-emitting devices and photovoltaics will studied in collaboration with Dr. Brian Gregg at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the specific information to be obtained regarding the structure-property relationships in metal bipyridyl systems, this research project has significant implications for light emitting diode, photovoltaic and other molecularly-based technologies. In addition to the aforementioned possibility that material properties can be tuned via chemical structural modification, the metal bipyridyl systems offer the possibility that high quality thin films can be prepared avoiding important challenges posed by vapor deposition procedures currently required for low-work function metal films (e.g., high cost, limited scale-up potential, etc). Molecular conductors also offer the possibility of creating electronic junctions where the contacting materials are more chemically compatible than in many current devices.  Finally, this research activity will serve as a rich environment for the training of undergraduate and graduate students; they will not only gain expertise in fundamental chemistry and physics, but also experience how ideas develop into new technologies, literally from the atomic scale to the tangible device.",
