 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most plant species depend on animals for successful reproduction. However, many plants and their associated pollinators are declining for reasons that are not well known. This project examines the extent to which pollen limitation is due to reduced movements of pollinators caused by landscape fragmentation and habitat loss.  Since most pollinators are very small, the effects of habitat fragmentation on their movement has never before been tested.   A large-scale experiment designed to disentangle the effects of tropical forest landscape connectivity, patch size, and habitat loss on plant pollination will test this idea. The study will be conducted in a tropical forest; this forest type is declining rapidly and plant-pollinator interactions in tropical forests is often highly specialized.\r\n\r\nThe project will capitalize on the charisma and diversity of tropical hummingbirds to transmit ideas about the importance of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services to the general public. Results will be transferred to over 10,000 school children and undergraduates annually. School children in Oregon and Costa Rica will take part in a citizen-based monitoring effort to test whether landscape fragmentation affects hummingbirds.",
