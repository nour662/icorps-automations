Understanding mechanisms associated with the structural characteristics of the prosthesis, the higher energetic costs of amputee locomotion, and common walking asymmetries in lower extremity amputees could impact prosthetic design and rehabilitation programs. Two new research projects involving lower extremity amputees would benefit from the acquisition of the requested equipment. One project would investigate the effect of increasing prosthesis mass on the mechanics and energetics of amputee locomotion. The second would focus on improving  models of the prosthetic ankle by creating a method for identifying the instant center of rotation of prosthetic ankles. Current research in the Biomechanics Lab has been limited to 2-D analyses, but with acquisition of the requested equipment, the proposed research would expand to 3-D analyses.",
