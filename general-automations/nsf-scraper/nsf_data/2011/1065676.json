New technologies are needed to design devices that have the required sensitivity, flexibility and ease of manipulation and, when necessary, biocompatibility.  Starting from well-known biological structures such as diatom and sponge silica, seashells and bone, and structures with hierarchical organization and high mechanical strength (e.g. organic fibers like spider silk), principles for design of novel nanomaterials with superior properties are being developed using biomimetic nanotechnogy.  The symposium will cover research on bioinspired and biointegrated materials with novel properties and will expand into the rational design and development of functional devices that are assembled based on the interconnections of traditional materials science, chemistry and biology disciplines.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  The organizers of the symposium have organized the event to encourage and facilitate the participation of underrepresented groups, students, and postdoctoral scientists. \r\nSpecific plans in this direction include: (1) a session for student and postdoctoral talks, (2) student award for best oral and best poster presentations, (3) inviting young researchers, females and members of underrepresented groups to present talks and chair sub-sessions, (4) promoting participation of undergraduate students by submitting information about the symposium, targeting undergraduate institutions, and facilitating abstract acceptance in a manner that gives special attention to these categories of researchers.",
