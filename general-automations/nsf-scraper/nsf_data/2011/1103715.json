 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2011, Intersections of Biology and Mathematical and Physical Sciences. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow at the intersection of biology with physics. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Maria Kamenetska is \"Unwinding DNA: measuring mechanical stiffness of a single DNA molecule to understand histone control over gene transcription.\" The host institution for this fellowship is Yale University with sponsoring scientists Drs. Lynne Regan and Simon Mochrie.\r\n\r\nHistone proteins package DNA into chromatin.  This research explores how histones control the unwinding of DNA to open it for the steps that lead to protein synthesis.  Changes in histones are believed to affect the pliability of chromatin and thus the accessibility of DNA for transcription.  Single molecule nano-manipulation and force-spectroscopy techniques from physics are being used to quantitatively assess the affect of histone modification on DNA.  Chromatin re-constituted with exclusively wild-type or modified histones is being prepared for studies that use optical tweezers and AFM-based force-spectroscopy techniques to stretch single chromatin tethers and measure their mechanical and structural properties.  These experiments enable an unambiguous comparison of pliability of individual DNA molecules with different histone compositions and thus reveal the role of histones in controlling gene expression.\r\n\r\nTraining objectives include learning molecular biological techniques and acquiring relevant biochemical skills to prepare homogenous preparations of chromatin fibers.  Broader impacts include educational outreach to biology students to learn single molecule nano-manipulation techniques and generally promoting the dissemination of physical approaches in biological science at the host institution.  Also, outreach includes developing and teaching a physics-based module to supplement the biology curriculum for Breakthrough New Heaven, a summer program for disadvantaged middle-school students.",
