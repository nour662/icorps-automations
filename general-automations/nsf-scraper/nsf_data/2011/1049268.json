 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach (MFO) in Germany is one of the leading mathematical research centers worldwide. MFO host approximateluy 2,500 internationally renowned guest researchers each year. These scientists come from all over the world, with more than 20% coming from the United States. The scientific programs of the MFO cover all important topics and new developments in mathematics and its applications in science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis award provides funding to support the participation of additional US-based young researchers, called \"US Junior Oberwolfach Fellows\", in Oberwolfach activities. Participation in the workshops and seminars will give these researchers the opportunity to meet top senior scientists from all over the world and gain experience in the scientific community. The award provides partial support for 100 US Junior Oberwolfach Fellowships per year, in average 2 young scientists per week (graduate students and postdocs with at most 10 years after Ph.D.), starting in April 2011, with a duration of 5 years.",
