This series of annual meetings at Northwestern University has entered its thirty-third year. As in the past, this year's Colloquium consists of two programs. The central theme of the Research Program is probability in analysis and other related fields, whose centerpiece will be two lectures by Russell Lyons of Indiana University. The topic of the Tutorial Program is mass transportation and applications to probability and will be led by Karl-Theodor Sturm of Bonn University. In addition to providing full support for the speakers, the funds from the NSF will be used to cover partial travel and lodging expenses for graduate students, younger researchers, members of unrepresented minority groups, and several senior active participants.",
