 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to develop an integrative approach to understanding incipient and youthful rift zones developing in thick continental lithosphere by targeting a portion of the East African Rift system in northern Tanzania and southern Kenya. The development of these rifts is a fundamental plate tectonic process yet the driving forces behind rift initiation and early evolution are tenuously understood, particularly the feedbacks and trade-offs between strain accommodation by magmatic and tectonic processes (dike intrusion vs. faulting). Furthermore, the integrative roles of hydrothermal fluids and preexisting structure in weakening the lithosphere and focusing deformation and magmatic activity are virtually unexplored in developing rift systems. This project seeks to explain the relative roles of magma systems below incipient rifts, the development of large border faults and systems of distributed normal faults across rift valleys, and the geochemical influences of hydrothermal fluids in weakening thick continental lithosphere and promoting the development and evolution of focused rift zones. This analysis will utilize: (1) field-based mapping of fault system geometries and dynamics to characterize spatial patterns of strain in association with magmatic systems; (2) 3D visualization of magmatic and fault systems in the lithosphere, and crustal and upper mantle structure along the length of the rift zone segments, using geophysical imaging (a broadband seismic array); (3) sampling of gas emissions from hydrothermal springs along border fault systems to determine chemical signatures of fluids that may contribute to weakening within the lithosphere; and (4) sampling of volcanic products exposed by fault systems for geochronologic analysis, providing temporal constraints on faulting events in relation to magmatic episodes and allowing a quantification of time-averaged strain rates. This study will result in the development of an integrated model of magmatic and fault system interactions during the early stages of rifting that can serve as a benchmark for evaluating continental rift evolution globally.\r\n\r\nContinental rift zones are enigmatic in that they develop in thick, strong continental lithosphere for reasons that are poorly understood. Their development is a linchpin of the of plate tectonic process, however, facilitating continents breaking apart, forming ocean basins by the process of mid-ocean ridge spreading. Rift zones worldwide are commonly associated with large magnitude earthquakes as well as volcanic activity, either focused at discrete volcanoes or erupting from tens of kilometer long fissures. They thus present geologic hazards that threaten humans living in rift zone environments worldwide, including the U.S.A. Past work on rift zones in advanced stages of development (prior to continental breakup) has shown that the progressive stretching and thinning of the continental lithosphere by rifting allows the mantle to well up beneath the rift and melt. In young and developing rift systems, however, magma appears to be important for rifting despite very little mantle upwelling at that stage. This suggests that, despite the presence of thick continental lithosphere, magma is able to form and ascend into the crust, enabling extension and helping to drive the faulting. The lithosphere is clearly weakened in some manner to allow magmatic activity to be so focused. This research team hypothesizes that lithosphere weakening is assisted by focused, deep mantle fluids associated with developing magmatic systems and that these fluids chemically alter and weaken the lithosphere, allowing magma to intrude and drive rift development. This work in the East African Rift will allow researchers to determine the relative roles of these fluids and intruding magma in weakening the lithosphere and allowing faults to develop. By combining fieldwork, geophysics, geochemistry, and geochronology, a model for rift development and evolution will be formulated that is integrated across disciplines and will capture multiple facets of the rifting processes. The results of the work will be applicable to rift zone development globally and can thus be integrated into existing plate tectonic models to provide a rationale for why continental breakup is possible.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe rifting and extension of continents is one of the fundamental components of plate tectonics and is an essential aspect of our understanding of continental evolution.    From a practical point of view, these environments tend to be rich in resources such as minerals and geothermal energy.   The East African Rift is an ideal venue so investigate the processes at work in rifting environments as it is both clearly actively extending and is relatively easy to access.   The project we carried out was designed to investigate these processes using a multi-disciplinary approach that included subsurface imaging (seismic, magnetotelluric, gravity), geodesy (GPS and INSAR), earthquake locations and mechanisms, structural geology, and geochemistry.   This multitude of tasks was divided among a number of groups; our team at Rensselaer was tasked with generating subsurface images of density and compressional and shear wavespeeds and to see how these correlated with earthquake locations and mechanism.  Our specific goal was to determine the size, location and geometry magma body beneath the rift valley and see how it relates to the locations of volcanoes, faults, and earthquakes.   We installed a 40 station seismic network in the rift valley and analyzed data recorded by this network over a period of two years.  The three-dimensional images we created from this analysis demonstrate that, during the first few million years of rift basin development, the structure of the continental crustal structure is fundamentally modified by magmatic processes. To first order, we find that the magma chamber beneath the rift valley appears as regions of exceptionally low (by 10-20%) shear wavespeed relative to that of average continental crust. The location and geometry of these regions of low wavespeeds mimic the topography, with the slowest shear wave speeds corresponding to the lowest elevations, and tracing out a NE-SW striking region about 20 km wide from the Natron basin in the north to a NW-SE region of similar width beneath the Manyara basin in the south.   In other words, the magma body conforms to the location of the central part of the valley.  These presence of magma and other fluids beneath the rift valley extends upwards to near the surface from at least 30 km depth, the limit of depth resolution for this dataset and near the base of the crust (~35 km). Somewhat surprisingly, a second region of significant low wavespeed beneath the large and recently active Ngorongoro volcanic caldera located just to the west of the rift valley appears to be physically cut off from the magma beneath the main part of the rift zone by a relatively thin (&lt; 10 km) wide zone of higher shear wave speeds that lies along the western edge of the fault-bounded rift. The narrow ridge of higher velocity lower crustal material may be a consequence of flexural uplift of the rift flank in response to stretching of strong, cratonic lithosphere.   We also find that the location of the magma chamber appears to be bound by active faults and,unexpectedly, that these faults are seismically active, even though one would expect the rocks in this region to be too hot to sustain brittle failure.  The high quality data set collected by this project is now available to the general public via the IRIS Data Management Center.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven W Roecker"
