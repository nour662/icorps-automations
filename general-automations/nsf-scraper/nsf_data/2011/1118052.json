Findings from these studies anchor the work in the second strand, which involves the design, development, and evaluation of Calico, a design sketching environment centering on five distinct features: (1) fluid manipulation of sketched content through carefully designed gestures, (2) refinement from rough sketches to precise models through scraps and softmodes, (3) approximate analysis of incomplete and imprecise models via annotations and imprecise languages, (4) abstraction from code to sketch through contextualized sketching, and (5) access to and reflection upon design history through intentional interfaces and design history views.\r\n\r\nThe techniques and tools developed by this project are intended to transform how software designers work and improve the quality of the resulting software-intensive systems, with impact in both in industry and in education.",
