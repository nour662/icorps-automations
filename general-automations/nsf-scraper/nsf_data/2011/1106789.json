 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this research project is to develop efficient statistical techniques for regression analysis of time-to-event data with complex censoring such as current status data or interval-censored data.  Specifically, the investigator will study three types of problems that often occur in medical and public health researches.  One is to develop efficient score function-based estimation procedures for univariate current status or interval-censored data that apply to more general situations and give practitioners more flexibilities in analyzing these data.  The second is to develop efficient score function-based estimation procedures for bivariate current status or interval-censored data and the third is to develop efficient sieve maximum likelihood estimation procedures for bivariate current status or interval-censored data. The second and the third parts will investigate the same problem but employ different modeling and inference strategy to allow one to focus on different aspects of the data analysis or different questions.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study will advance not only the theoretical research in statistics pertaining to survival analysis but also provide statistical methods for data analysis in a wide range of scientific disciplines including  public health, medicine, demographics, economics and psychology.",

These data commonly occur in many studies, especially medical and public health researches such as clinical\ntrials for drug development and assessment.  By interval censoring, we mean that the follow-up on the study subjects are discrete and they are observed or examined only periodically\ninstead of continuously.  More specifically, the research project developed three types of statistical procedures that can provide more general and efficient analyses of the interval-censored failure time data, which was not possible before the research project.  They are the efficient score\nfunction-based estimation procedures for univariate interval-censored data, the efficient score function-based estimation procedures for bivariate interval-censored data, and the efficient sieve maximum likelihood estimation procedures for bivariate interval-censored\ndata.   Here univariate means only one response variable, while bivariate means two related rsponse variables.  In addition, the project also developed some new tools that can be used to deal with\nsome new issues in public health and medicine.  The results of the project significantly advanced not only the failure time data filed but also many other fields such as demographics, economics and psychology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/21/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jianguo (Tony) Sun"
