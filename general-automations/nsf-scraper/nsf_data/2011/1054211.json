 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to gain an understanding of how age-related mechanical\r\nchanges in cells increase their susceptibility to being bound by the amyloid peptide and\r\nits aggregate forms. A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AB) is the rearrangement of the Ab to a\r\nnon-native conformation that promotes the formation of toxic, nanoscale aggregates. The\r\nlargest risk factor for AD is aging, and the proposed work aims to determine how mechanical\r\nchanges in cells associated with aging increases the ability of AB to bind cellular surfaces. For\r\nthese studies, age-related alterations of membranes will be mimicked by specific chemical and\r\ncompositional alterations to lipid bilayers, which are models of a cells plasma membrane, prior\r\nto exposure to AB. In parallel, the ability of AB to bind to cells in culture, with chemically induced\r\nchanges in mechanical properties designed to mimic ageing, will also be determined. Agerelated\r\nchanges include oxidative damage, enhanced cholesterol content of the membrane, and\r\ndisruption of cytoskeletal components. Scanning probe microscopy techniques will be applied to\r\ncorrelate mechanical changes, measured with nanoscale spatial resolution, of the model lipid\r\nbilayers and cells with their susceptibility to Ab binding and subsequent disruption.\r\nIf successful, the proposed research would yield detailed understanding of how cellular surface\r\nproperties associated with aging influence AB membrane binding, aggregation, and ultimately\r\ntoxicity. The binding of Ab and its aggregate forms to cellular surfaces represents a fundamental\r\nstep in potential toxic mechanisms associated with AD and has broader implications in\r\nprotein/membrane interactions. The educational plan focuses on providing meaningful research\r\nexperience to pre-service science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers,\r\nwith a particular focus on pre-service teachers (PSTs) planning on careers in the region of\r\nAppalachia, as persons from economically-distressed counties in this region are\r\nunderrepresented in STEM fields. The PSTs will develop a lesson or teachable unit based on\r\ntheir research activities that can be directly translated into the classroom. It is believed that\r\nparticipating PSTs will be able to improving science education in the region",
