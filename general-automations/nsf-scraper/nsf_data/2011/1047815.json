 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists are generating data at an unprecedented scale and rate. There is tremendous value in not only analyzing this data but also sharing it among scientists. Cloud-computing platforms are well-suited to support such sharing: They offer a single logical location for data, access to data management tools for analyzing it, and a pay-as-you-go charging mechanism. However, while cloud-computing systems offer simple pricing schemes for storage and compute resources, the economics of data sharing are poorly understood and only coarsely supported.\r\n\r\nThis research is developing models and infrastructures to establish relational data markets in the cloud. These markets enable scientists to upload their data and make it publicly available in the cloud, then recoup costs by charging others for using the data. The data markets also enable scientists to share their data with direct collaborators and see the cloud costs fairly distributed among team members.\r\n\r\nThe project is building a prototype system on the Windows Azure cloud to implement these data markets.\r\n\r\nThis project is having impact on both cloud computing and science by introducing new pricing techniques for data sharing in the cloud. The software and technical papers resulting from this project are being disseminated through the project website (http://cloud-data-pricing.cs.washington.edu/).",

To reduce the cost (since a typical aggregate query may touch the private data of many data owners) our approach is to give buyers the option to receive a perturbed answer to their query.  We have developed a principled formalism for computing the price based on the noise, which is both arbitrage-free and also compensates the data owners in proportion to their privacy loss.  At one extreme, the data analyst may purchase the raw, unperturbed query answer at a high price; at the other extreme, he may purchase the query answer with a high perturbation that guarantees that all private data remains epsilon-differentially private, at a very small price.  Our formalism offers a continuum of options in between.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/12/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Magdalena Balazinska"
