The workshop will engage ten researchers from UA and 15 from UNAM with an eye towards developing complementary proposals for a research coordination network (RCN) to NSF's Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program and to CONACyT, NSF's counterpart agency in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis proposal covers an important topic that the attendees will address in a creative and promising way, relating their work on the U.S.-Mexico borderlands to a broader set of dryland settings.  The potential attendees constitute a mix of established and early-career scientists, and the research that would result from this interaction will lead to better approaches for managing and responding to vulnerabilities in dryland systems, not only in the U.S. and Mexico, but also in similar environments around the world.  The workshop should provide a fruitful setting to stimulate future collaborative activity between UA and UNAM.  Two graduate students and three junior faculty will be involved in the workshop and subsequent activities.  Involvement of young researchers in collaborative international activities is a major goal of OISE.",

The premise being that while the larger challenges are common &ndash; climate change, wildfire, invasive species, habitat fragmentation, and the multiple dimensions of urbanization &ndash; political institutions, national economies and divergent environmental histories have brought about different outcomes to-date, and offer contrasting future trajectories.  We argue that to better understand options for adaptation to change, there is value in exploring these differences in the dryland environments that are (1) literally adjacent and separated only by an arbitrary boundary (\"shared\" environments), or (2) physically separated but analogous physical and biological environments on either side of the border that have comparable or even ecologically linked biomes (\"paired\" environment).  The study of these environments and the contrasting management regimes in which they exist might yield a set of problems that would be appropriate for study in a controlled environment.\n\n Objectives:\n\nCatalyze new international connections and collaborations between researchers and students at the UofA and UNAM, as they relate to the shared/paired drylands in the US and Mexico.\nAnalyze the \"grand challenges\" confronting drylands in both countries and inventory relevant resources to address them.\nIdentify key research approaches and strategies for moving forward.\nProvide draft products that can be developed into research proposals for various sponsors and funders.\n\n\nResults\n\nGrand Challenges \n\nWorking groups (random groups with representation from both UA and UNAM) were asked to define the \"grand challenges\" that confront their dryland environments.  The topic was intentionally broad to allow wide-ranging discussion. Although broad, the discussion was focused on four areas of primary concern (1) energy, (2) ecosystem services, (3) water, and (4) sustainability). Within this framework, four working groups identified more the 50 challenges. \n\nKey Research Questions \n\nWithin these grand challenges, three working groups then were asked to identify the underlying research questions that must be pursued in order to address these large problem sets.\n\nGroup A\n\nWhat is the carrying capacity of environment (current and future)?\nHow we develop and integrated assessment framework?\nHow we develop scenarios for the main drivers (ecological, climate, human, economical, etc.)?\nWhat are the impacts and end risks of biofuel alternatives?\nWhat are top down and bottom up drivers of adaptation in both countries?\nBonus Question: Do we know enough?\n\n\nGroup B\n\nHow do dry lands elucidate opportunities for development of new sustainability science? \nWhat are the water, energy, and ecosystem challenges (present and future) for dry lands and what are the assessment and tradeoff tools needed?\na.      Both 1 and 2 must consider climate scenarios. \nWhat are opportunities to achieve ecosystem-energy-water cross-efficiency and what are bi-national comparative potentials?\nWhat are water, energy, and ecosystem tradeoffs of conversion of dry lands to agriculture? \nHow to minimize the water and ecosystem, social economic impacts of 20 X 20 kilometer solar facility to power North America?\n\n\n\nGroup C\n\nHow can we develop models and tools for adaptation in NW Mexico and SW U.S.?\nWhat is the impact of local land surface change on regional and global climate? \nWhat are the relative contributions of water and energy markets to poverty, vulnerability and options for adaptation?\nCan we manage water d..."
