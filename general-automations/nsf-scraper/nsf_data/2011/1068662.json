 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will provide support for undergraduate research, teaching, and outreach in beam physics at the California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) in collaboration with the Laboratory of Elementary Particle Physics (LEPP) at Cornell University. Presently, the Cornell Electron-Positron Storage Ring (CESR) has two modes of operation: 1) as a test accelerator for the International Linear Collider (ILC) damping ring (CesrTA), and 2) as a synchrotron radiation source for the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). The intellectual merit of this award is to continue the ongoing effort of research and development of CESR beam diagnostics capable of quantifying bunch-by-bunch and turn-by-turn beam dynamics to study important ILC damping ring machine parameters and high brightness operation of CHESS. The investigator has a strong record of research on beam physics at Cornell, and will continue existing collaborative efforts for the study of beam optics and dynamics. The research plan outlined in the proposal provides an excellent opportunity for the involvement of undergraduates in accelerator physics research at a 4-year college, the enrichment of the curriculum, and outreach to the public through the Cal Poly's Center for Excellence in Science and Mathematical Education (CESaME).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project consisted of beam dynamics research at two of the premiere accelerator laboratories: i) Cornell University and ii) at SLAC, the Stanford National Accelerator Center.\n\nAt Cornell University, we participate on the Cornell Electron-Positron Storage Ring Test Accelerator (CesrTA) collaboration in the investigation of the physics of ultra-low emittance beams of electrons and positrons in the Cornell Electron/Positron Storage Ring (CESR).\n\nThe research consisted of developing beam diagnostics capable of quantifying bunch-by-bunch and turn-by-turn beam dynamics for bunch trains with 4 ns bunch spacing, creating new experimental techniques to quantify important beam parameters for ultra-low emittance beams of electrons and positrons, conducting beam dynamics experiments on CesrTA, and most importantly providing Cal Poly undergraduate students research experience in particle beam dynamics.\n\nOne of the key goals of the CesrTA research program is to improve our understanding of the interaction of the electron cloud with the high-energy particle beam. When electron or positron bunches circulate in a storage ring they produce synchrotron radiation.  The synchrotron radiation hits the vacuum chamber wall and produces a cloud of low energy electrons via photoemission. Further increases in the cloud occur when these low energy electrons are accelerated by the beam and strike the wall producing a cascade of secondary electrons.  For positron bunches in the storage ring, the electron cloud is attracted toward the path of the circulating beam.  Two severe consequences of the electron cloud on the positron bunches are emittance blow-up and the coupling of transverse motion between bunches in a bunch train.  The electron cloud constrains many of the operational parameters of the storage ring such as beam current; bunch spacing, ring energy, and these parameters can be measured experimentally on CesrTA.  Using the beam diagnostics developed to quantify the electron cloud effect on CesrTA beams are shown below in figures 1-3 and have been published in numerous publications.\n\nWe are part of a collaboration that have conducted preliminary experiments channeling an electron beam in bent crystals have been conducted at the End Station Test Beam facility at SLAC.  Channeling is the phenomenon that arises when charged particles become trapped between the crystal planes due to the electrostatic field of the crystal ions.  For positively charged particles, the ion field is positive and the charged particles are confined to the interatomic region of the crystal.  Negatively charged particles are attracted to the crystal ions and stay in the region of the crystal planes.   If the crystal is bent, the charged particles will bend in the direction of the crystal due to its strong electrostatic field, and as a result, the crystal can deflect the particles more effectively than any existing magnet as shown in figure 4.\n\nThere is strong interest in using bent crystals as collimators and magnets for high-energy electron and positron beams and well as using crystals as generators of &gamma;-rays as a positron crystal undulator.  A crystal undulator is based on planar channeling of an ultra-relativistic positron beam in a bent crystal whose crystallographic planes are bent periodically.  The positron beam follows a nearly sinusoidal-like trajectory and produces stimulated undulator type electromagnetic radiation due to the periodic bending of the particles in the crystallographic planes.  The development of a crystal undulator opens the prospect of creation of novel light sources that will find their application in technology, medicine and basic sciences. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert L Holtzapple"
