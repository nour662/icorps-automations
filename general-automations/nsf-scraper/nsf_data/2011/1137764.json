 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative research program between the Center for Simulation, Visualization\r\nand Real Time Computing (SiViRT) at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) and the\r\nDepartment of Computer Science at the University of Texas Pan American (UTPA). The\r\nproposal aims to bring together faculty members and graduate students of the two institutions for the purpose of enhancing existing research and improving the education of minority and women graduate students. The objectives of this collaborative research proposal are:\r\na) to develop a highly efficient and reliable Direct Numerical Simulation method (DNS) that can\r\ncharacterize particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions in both monodisperse and\r\npolydisperse particulate flows; b) to apply the DNS as a tool to develop constitutive equations\r\nand closure laws that can be used for the Two-Fluid Model (TFM); and c) to establish strong\r\nconnections and ties between the two minority Institutions and integrate educational activities\r\nwithin the proposed research by attracting under-represented minority students to\r\nengineering research programs.\r\nParticulate flows are involved in many natural and engineering processes. Examples are:\r\ncolloids in chemical engineering processes; dust and aerosols in the atmosphere; particulate and\r\ndroplet transport associated with sediments in rivers; fluidized bed reactors; and drugs and\r\nsupplements delivered through the human circulatory system. The size and properties of particles\r\nin a particulate system have wide ranges (polydisperse system). Numerical simulations have\r\nbeen a very effective tool for understanding the nature of the particle-particle and particle-fluid\r\ninteractions. However, the primary challenge in modeling life-sized particle-fluid systems is the\r\nlarge separation of scales, ranging from macro-scale (device scale) to micro scale (particle scale).\r\nThe DNS provides detailed information on particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions; it can\r\nbe used to study many poorly understood phenomena in particulate flows, such as particle\r\n\"bubbling\", segregation, and agglomeration.",
