The workshop series Learning from Unanticipated Scientific Security Research Results\r\n(LUSSRR) addresses this limitation.  Through this series of workshops, researchers present their unexpected results - which may be failures, but may also be opportunities to learn something other than what was expected.  This process encourages researchers to learn from each other and avoid duplication of effort, while encouraging new approaches to old problems.  LUSSRR workshops publish proceedings which are included in the traditional digital libraries such as IEEE and ACM.",
