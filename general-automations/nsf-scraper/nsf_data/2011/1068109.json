Matthews \r\n\r\nThe proposed Center for Biophotonic Sensors and Systems (CBSS) will advance photonics technology as the enabler for major advances in disease diagnostics and drug discovery. The research efforts will be anchored by Boston University's Photonic Center as the lead institution, partnered with the University of California-Davis Center for Biophotonic Science and Technology. \r\n\r\nThe proposed Center, comprised of Boston University (BU) and the University of California-Davis (UCD), plans to establish a natural resource for Biophotonic Sensors and Systems (CBSS) where photonics provide the enabling technologies for advances in methods to detect/sense and identify biological properties, conditions, or changes at the molecular and cellular/sub-cellular level. The potential target applications of disease diagnosis, drug efficacy testing, patient monitoring, and food and water safety represent a balanced mixture of highly-relevant topics well suited to the I/UCRC model. Both BU and UCD have mature photonics research Centers and a track record of achievement in managing translational research activities. The proposed CBBS will build on the respective University's research talent and technology transfer skills to attract industrial partners who will subsequently play a significant role in planning, selecting, and implementing the output of the research. \r\n\r\nThe focus on global health initiatives and numerous planned educational programs provides a platform for significant broader impact of this center. Technology transfer plans are appropriate and both universities have a good history of translational research. The industry participation will enhance the students educational experience by providing a pipeline for talented engineers and scientist to industry. BU and UCD are committed to developing the academic potential of under-represented groups in STEM fields. The success of the proposed Center will enable new photonics sensor technologies that can improve public healthcare, food and water safety, and homeland security.",
