 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator considers new default prior distributions for\r\nBayesian model selection and model averaging in linear and generalized\r\nlinear models.  Prior choice for model specific parameters and for\r\nprior model probabilities is of critical importance, particularly for\r\nmodeling high dimensional relationships where subjective\r\nspecifications are impractical or where an ``objective'' analysis is\r\ndesired.  New families of objective priors that have desirable risk\r\nproperties, adapt to unknown degrees of sparsity, and also permit\r\ntractable computations for large scale model search are studied. In\r\nhigh dimensional problems, the dimension of the model space is\r\nastronomical. Innovative methodology and algorithms for large scale\r\nstochastic search and model averaging for high dimensional model\r\nspaces are developed, with an emphasis on algorithms that exploit the\r\narchitecture of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs).  GPUs provide the\r\ncomputing power of a distributed cluster, but at a fraction of their\r\ncost and space/cooling requirements, but require care in the\r\ndevelopment of statistical algorithms that take advantage of their\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nAdvances in technology have led to the collection of high dimensional\r\ndata structures, spawning an increasingly complex array of statistical\r\nmodels for data. Goals of data analysis may include prediction and/or\r\nselection of a subset of models to test particular theories or to\r\nreduce attention from many speculative models to a few well chosen\r\nmodels; these are fundamental problems in statistics and throughout\r\nthe sciences. In such settings, model uncertainty is ubiquitous.\r\nBayesian methods offer an effective and conceptually appealing\r\napproach for addressing model uncertainty through Bayesian model\r\naveraging, incorporating both parameter and model uncertainty, while\r\nstill permitting selection of a model via coherent decision-theoretic\r\nprinciples.  The methodological developments are driven by issues that\r\narise from the following applications 1) identifying important factors\r\nto predict protein activity; 2) predicting risk of international\r\nconflict; 3) health effects of criteria pollutants; and 4) identifying\r\nsingle nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with ovarian\r\ncancer risk.  As prediction and model selection are some of\r\nthe most fundamental and widespread problems in the sciences and\r\nbeyond, the project's impact extends beyond the applications listed\r\nabove.  The development and distribution of software ensures that\r\nthese methods are widely available.",
