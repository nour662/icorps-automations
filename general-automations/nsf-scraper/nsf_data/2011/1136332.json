 "awd_abstract_narration": "The State University of New York at Brockport is developing and implementing resources and methodologies to improve technological pedagogical content knowledge in teacher education. The project is using resources and computational mathematics, science, and technology (C-MST) courses, developed under previous grants, to improve teacher education. It emphasizes the recently developed conceptual framework, technological pedagogical content knowledge that has now put both science educators and computational scientists on the same path to utilize an interdisciplinary approach to STEM and teacher education. Strong content knowledge (via a STEM degree), extensive field experience (150 hours), student teaching, dual certification (science and special education), computational pedagogy courses, monetary support in the form of internships and scholarships, and a capstone summer institute construct  a set of coherent strategies to attract, prepare, and retain a new cadre of 40 secondary school science teachers. The project is informed by a formative evaluation to enable frequent reviews and mid-course corrections and is disseminating its findings and resources through articles, conference papers and the project's website. The curriculum framework and learning modules are shared with national digital library collections contributing to teacher education nationwide.",

Accordingly, recent national K-12 learning objectives recommend constructivist activities to teach students experts&rsquo; habits of mind.

Today, they have evolved to showcase many structural and functional similarities with the brain. These similarities arise from quantifiable aspects of information constructs, as suggested by Alan Turing,<sup> </sup>and the appearance of a universal mechanism (Fig. 1) by which quantifiable things form and evolve. That is, like the granular matter, information constructs either unite associatively, as shown by the bottom-up arrows in Fig. 1, to make bigger constructs or break down distributively, as shown by the top-down arrows, to smaller ones.

The project produced two dozen articles that can help educators elsewhere to replicate or scale up this program to the national level.

Besides M&amp;S tools, researchers should explore other modular and scalable design toys as well as reading and writing practices to offer similar practices.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/15/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Osman&nbsp;Yasar</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136332/1136332_10126300_1505489143910_Noyce-impact-fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136332/1136332_10126300_1505489143910_Noyce-impact-fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A universal mechanism\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136332/1136332_10126300_1505489143910_Noyce-impact-fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A universal mechanism\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A universal mechanism by which all heterogeneous things from and evolve</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Osman Ya?ar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Osman&nbsp;Yasar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">A universal mechanism</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136332/1136332_10126300_1505489580777_Noyce-impact-fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136332/1136332_10126300_1505489580777_Noyce-impact-fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Device-independent computational processes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136332/1136332_10126300_1505489580777_Noyce-impact-fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Device-independent computational processes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Information processing by electronic and biological computing devices include both device-independent and device-dependent processes.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Osman Ya?ar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Osman&nbsp;Yasar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Device-independent computational processes</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136332/1136332_10126300_1505489651515_Noyce-impact-fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136332/1136332_10126300_1505489651515_Noyce-impact-fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Computational thinking\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136332/1136332_10126300_1505489651515_Noyce-impact-fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Computational thinking\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A cognitive framework on the essence of electronic CT skill set in terms of biological CT skills.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Osman Ya?ar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Osman&nbsp;Yasar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Computational thinking</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
