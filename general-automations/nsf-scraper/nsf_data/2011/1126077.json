 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant supports the acquisition of a wafer aligner and bonder system that will be placed in a shared user nanofabrication facility at the University of Pennsylvania.  Aligned wafer bonding technology provides the ability to precisely stack and join multiple semiconductor substrates to realize new types of micro- and nano-devices.  The technology significantly expands the capability of traditional microfabrication processes based on lithography, deposition, and etching by allowing wafers of various materials and thicknesses that are either patterned or unpatterned to be bonded together.  As a result, the technology enables the fabrication of 3D microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microfluidic platforms, and 3D integrated circuits and optical devices.  The wafer bonding system will allow for the precise lateral alignment and bonding of large diameter substrates using several important processes, including direct, anodic, glass-frit, metal, and polymer bonding.  The acquisition of the wafer aligner and bonder will enhance research capability in multiple areas, including micromechanical devices, small-scale fluidic systems, and the manufacturing of nanoelectronic and optical systems.  \r\n\r\nThis wafer aligner and bonder system will broadly impact both the research and training of a diverse body of students and researchers. Tools in the nanofabrication facility can be accessed by users from the University of Pennsylvania as well as users from other academic institutions, of which there are many in the surrounding region, and users from industry.  Furthermore, the fabrication facility is used by undergraduate students in their senior projects and in their undergraduate research, as well as graduate students and postdocs from many different academic departments, many of whom will make use of the requested instrumentation.  Thus, the tool will provide access to enhanced micro- and nano-manufacturing capability for a broad range of users developing leading edge small-scale devices.",
