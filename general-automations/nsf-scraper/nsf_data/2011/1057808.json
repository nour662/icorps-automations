 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Carmen Works of Sonoma State University will study the mechanism of catalyzed reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen in model compounds of iron-only hydrogenases. The approach is to first synthesize dimeric iron complex models of the enzyme active site, and then to use these molecules to test the hypothesis that light labilizes CO in these complexes to produce a model for the uninhibited form of the enzyme active site and that the coordination site of CO is occupied by a solvent molecule. The series of experiments to be performed include: CO dependent kinetics of the reactions of the photoproduct, kinetic solvent effects, temperature studies to determine activation parameters, spectroscopic analysis to monitor reactions of the photoproduct with molecular hydrogen, and quantum yield determinations. The broader impacts involve training undergraduate students in research methods, incorporating relevant materials into lecture and laboratory courses, and broadly disseminating the research results via publications and presentations at conferences.  \r\n\r\nThis work will deepen our understanding of biological enzymes that utilize and generate hydrogen.  Potential longer term impacts of the work could involve developing efficient methods to generate hydrogen as a clean fuel source and to use hydrogen in fuel cells.",

Many micro-organisms can both form and use molecular hydrogen through hydrogenase enzymes.  Hydrogenase enzymes can catalyze the reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen, and small inorganic molecules can be made that are both structural and functional models of these enzymes.  Model compounds of hydrogenases have been intensively studied as possible catalysts for the production and utilization of hydrogen.  Many of these models are active catalysis but only upon exposer to light, and little research has been conducted to understand why photolysis is important.  Studies focused on the photochemical reactivity of such model compounds.  These studies are important to obtain a better understanding of the chemical basis for the catalytic ability so hydrogen can be used as a fuel source.  Research from this project will help advance the design of new and inexpensive technological systems for hydrogen use.
