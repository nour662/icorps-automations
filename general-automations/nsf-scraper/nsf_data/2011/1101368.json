 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims to investigate problems from two diverse areas in number theory and\r\ncombinatorics.\r\nThe first project concerns arithmetic properties of modular forms on\r\nnoncongruence subgroups. To these forms Scholl attached motivic Galois\r\nrepresentations, which are expected to be connected to automorphic forms\r\n according to Langlands philosophy. These Galois representations, unlike\r\ntheir classical counterpart, cannot be broken into pieces in general,\r\nand should be related to automorphic forms on symplectic and orthogonal groups.\r\nBuilding upon her past work, PI will investigate the (potential) automorphy\r\nof Scholl representations with special symmetries, exploit consequences\r\nof automorphy, and study congruence properties of\r\nFourier coefficients of noncongruence forms as proposed by Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer.\r\nThe second project is to study the interplay between combinatorics,\r\ngroup theory and number theory through associated zeta functions. Zeta functions of varieties defined over finite fields are well-understood.\r\nTheir most well-known properties are described by Weil conjectures, established in early\r\n1970's. Finite simplicial complexes are combinatorial analog of such varieties. They are expected to have zeta functions enjoying similar properties, except that Riemann Hypothesis will hold only for complexes which are spectrally optimal. One-dimensional\r\ncomplexes are graphs, whose zeta functions have been studied since the work of Ihara in 1966.\r\nThe zeta functions for higher dimensional complexes became known only recently\r\nwhen PI and her students obtained closed form expressions for zeta functions of\r\ncomplexes arising as quotients of the buildings of certain rank-2 Chevalley groups over p-adic fields. The approaches are mostly representation-theoretic. The PI proposes to find zeta identities for complexes arising from other groups. She also intends to explore combinatorial interpretations of these identities using the Selberg trace formula, with an eye towards establishing a connection between complex zeta functions and automorphic forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been the PI's long term research goal to do fundamental\r\nresearch in number theory and to seek applications of number theory\r\nto combinatorics and to solve real world problems. The study of interplay between these areas has turned out to be quite fruitful. This proposal is a continuation of\r\nthe PI's effort to pursue the same general theme. Part of the research will be carried out by PI's Ph.D. students. The results from this proposal will be disseminated\r\nbroadly through the talks given by the PI in seminars, colloquia,\r\nconferences, short courses, and workshops. They will also be\r\nincorporated in the graduate courses to be offered by the PI. Weekly\r\ninformal seminars will be conducted to integrate research with\r\neducation and teaching. The PI also plans to co-organize a conference in 2013 at Banff\r\nto disseminate results related to this proposal obtained by her and her students.",
