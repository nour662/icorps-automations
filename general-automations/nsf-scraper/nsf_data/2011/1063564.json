 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous work has shown significant gender differences in the likelihoood to compete, with men being about twice as willing as women. More recent work suggests that these differences are driven by hormonal levels within an individual over time. This proposal will assess the relationship between hormones and both competitive and cooperative choices in a larger sample of men and women. Estrogen, progesterone (in women) and testosterone (in men and women) will be measured. A second study will add neuroimaging to test the hypothesis that gender and individual differences in competitive/cooperative choices result from hormonal modulation of activity in the brain's reward areas.\r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, the results showing that men are more willing to compete than women have been  and have been offered as a partial explanation for gender differences in outcomes in earnings and careers, including the scarcity of women in top executive and academic positions. This research will shed light on the causes of this result, and will help to evaluate the desirability and design of policy interventions to address such differences. A better understanding of the reasons for the wide variations in competitive behavior can also help individuals make more informed decisions about education and careers on their own as well.",
