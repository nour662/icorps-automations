 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wasatch Topology Conference takes place twice a year in Park City, Utah.  It brings top researchers to Utah, who disseminate their latest results. The topics cover a broad range, from geometric topology and homotopy theory, to low dimensional topology, geometry, and geometric group theory. \r\n\r\nThe last 25 years or so have seen an explosion in the study of geometric objects and their symmetries. Both University of Utah and BYU are among the centers of this endeavor. There is no doubt that past Wasatch Topology Conferences, organized by the faculty at these two institutions, have contributed to this success by featuring top research in this field. Being exposed to top research is particularly significant for graduate students and early career mathematicians. Many of the speakers at the conference were from underrepresented groups. The conference website is located at\r\nhttp://www.math.utah.edu/wtc/",
