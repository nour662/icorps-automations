 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Heitsch and his team model how hot, diffuse supernovae ejecta are integrated into turbulent molecular clouds and collapsing dense, molecular cloud cores. They assess the mixing efficiencies and mixing timescales for the fraction of supernova ejecta that can enter into the densest parts of molecular clouds which then can collapse into cores and finally become stars. One of the issues being studied is whether ejecta have to be mixed with the diffuse gas which subsequently gets compressed into collapsing objects, or whether they can be injected directly into dense cores. One specific aspect is to determine the fate of the short-lived radioactive nuclides (those with half-lives around a few million years) that are produced in supernovae. This has direct implications for formation models of our solar system because such short-lived radioactive nuclides were present when the solar system formed. \r\nThe improvement over earlier model computations is that instead of assuming idealized, smooth molecular clouds, the clouds themselves will have been naturally assembled in large-scale flows, and thus will have inherited their turbulent density and velocity structure from first principles. The investigators test the hypothesis whether this pre-existing substructure can increase the injection efficiencies and whether this is consistent with the available constraints for the young solar system. The program will involve a series of simulations of increasing complexity, including heating and cooling, magnetic fields, self-gravity, and the Eulerian and Lagrangian tracking of supernova ejecta. Calculations are performed with fixed and adaptive resolution codes, evolving the magneto-hydrodynamical equations including the above-mentioned physics. The simulations produce predictions for the fraction and distribution of short-lived radioactive nuclides. This project provides training opportunities for a postdoc, and for undergraduate student research projects on numerical techniques and data analysis. Resulting visualizations will be made available on the web and be integrated into a public outreach program involving shows at the Morehead Planetarium and presentations on the formation of the Solar System.",

Prior to its explosion, the star synthesizes certain short-lived radioactive elements. The explosion blasts this material into the surrounding space, thus contaminating the ambient interstellar gas. Out of this contaminated gas, new stars, and also the solar system, can form. Yet, comparing the observed amount of these elements in meteorites with the amount expected to be made by the massive star sets limits on the time and spatial distance between the explosion and the pre-solar system. The limits are so stringent that the explosion must have occurred at a point when the solar system was about to form out of a precursor dense gas cloud, the pre-solar cloud. The main issue with such a scenario is that the hot, diffuse gas from the stellar explosion does not mix very well with the cold, dense gas of the pre-solar cloud - previous studies showed that the resulting abundances are too low by at least a factor of 100.</p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Yet, previous studies have also made highly idealized assumptions about pre-solar cloud structure, specifically that the cloud have a smooth surface. Observations indicate that pre-stellar clouds are highly structured. The project explored two mechanisms to increase the amount of contamination of the pre-solar cloud: The first mechanism relies on the assumption that the target cloud is structured. High-resolution fluid dynamics simulations were performed comparing the amount of contamination in smooth and structured clouds. We find that for structured clouds, the contamination can be increased, but it still falls short by a factor of 10 compared to observations. The second mechanism assumes that - based on observational evidence - the radioactive elements are carried on dust grains synthesized in the expanding blast shell, rather than being carried along in the gas phase. Dust grains have a much higher inertia than gas particles and thus can travel farther into the dense pre-solar cloud. Yet, at higher ambient gas densities, dust grains collide more often with molecules and atoms, being slowly destroyed in the process, thus releasing the radioactive elements into the pre-solar cloud (see Fig. 1). Our simulations demonstrate that this mechanism can increase the degree of contamination up to the observed level, providing a possible explanation for the chemical composition of the solar system.</p>\n<p><span>To further constrain the possible scenarios, we quantified the&nbsp;</span>amount of contamination depending on the dust grain size. Since the exact grain size distributions are not known, we explored four grain sizes (see Fig. 2), demonstrating that while smaller grains are stopped and destroyed quickly, larger grains can travel far into the target cloud. This differentiation in contamination depending on grain sizes may explain the absence of certain chemical elements otherwise expected from a supernova explosion. Fig. 3 highlights the efficiency with which gas of different densities can be contaminated. The densest cloud parts are most likely to form stars, therefore, we are interested in determining the contamination of the densest gas.
