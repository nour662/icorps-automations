 "awd_abstract_narration": "South East Regional Meeting On Numbers (SERMON) is a two-day meeting on number theory, taken in a very broad sense.  It is held annually each spring semester at rotating institutions and offers participants the opportunity to explore new ideas and concepts. A primary goal is to encourage collaborative efforts among number theorists and combinatorialists in the southeast by providing a friendly, informal setting where they can come together.  Another objective of SERMON meetings is to involve number theorists at all career stages; SERMON speakers include graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty.\r\n\r\nThe 23rd annual South East Regional Meeting On Numbers will be held on April 16-17, 2011 at the Armstrong Atlantic State University.  This yearly conference will feature 20 minute talks by students and faculty as well as one hour talks by one or more noted mathematicians.  A regional conference such as this encourages the participation of both graduate students and junior faculty and allows them to increase their understanding and advance their knowledge in ways that would otherwise not be available to them. The conference will also allow students and staff from teaching-oriented universities to connect with their colleagues from research-oriented universities. Particularly for students, this will expose them to career paths beyond the undergraduate level.",
