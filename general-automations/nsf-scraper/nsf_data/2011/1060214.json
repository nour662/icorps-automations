 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will attract students to engineering and increase the persistence of these by combining scholarships, multiple-mentors, professional development activities and internship opportunities to help them succeed as students as they plan for future careers or graduate study. The proposed project uses the \"fund and guide\" model to help talented, but financially needy students complete their degrees in a timely fashion and move into the workforce or graduate studies. Undergraduates in Electrical, Mechanical, and Industrial & System Engineering will participate as a cohort group from their freshman to senior years. Scholarships of $5,000 per semester (up to $45,000) will be provided to participants enrolled in a 9-semester dual BS/BA degree program in engineering. Key program elements include scholarships, a comprehensive mentorship program, research internships, and a professional development seminar series designed to help students to bridge the gap between the classroom environment and the expectations and realities of the workplace. Project success, defined in terms of five performance objectives will be systematically evaluated, reported, and disseminated.",
