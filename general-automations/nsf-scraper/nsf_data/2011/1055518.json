 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the realm of biomass conversion to biofuels, many thermoconversion catalytic routes are under study, while far fewer bioconversion catalytic routes receive the same study. This is reflective of the difficulty of the problem. One of the challenging technological barriers to the large scale bioconversion of plant biomass to advanced biofuels is the limited understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of cell wall polysaccharide hydrolysis by individual and synergistic hydrolytic enzymes. Therefore, saccharification reaction outcomes are not predictable over variables of reaction scale, feedstock variability and enzyme systems.  PI Tina Jeoh, of the University of California Davis proposes to understand cellulase-cellulose interactions that impact the kinetics of hydrolysis, and relate studies of fundamental interfacial interactions at the molecular-scale to saccharification rates on the bulk-scale as the research objective of her CAREER project.  Specific tools to be used to study the effect of cellulose surface chemistry of native, never-dried cellulose microfibrils on interfacial interactions with water and enzymes include atomic force microscopy, confocal microscopy and in vitro biochemical assays. The experimental capabilities will be further enhanced during this project by chemical force spectroscopy using scanning probes conjugated to specific chemistries or protein to directly probe cellulose surface chemistry at the nanometer scale. These approaches represent significantly comprehensive attacks on the problem of enzymatic cell wall degradation, and promise to increase the fundamental understanding of this area.\r\n\r\nAn equally aggressive approach has been proposed for the educational component of the CAREER award, with emphasis on increasing the representation of women in engineering. PI Jeoh believes women are under-represented in the STEM workforce largely due to insufficient environmental and nurturing factors throughout their education. One of the educational approaches of this CAREER proposal is to engage K-12 girls in surrounding communities in an annual WISTEM for girls fair where 50-60 girls from Yolo county schools will be invited to the UC Davis campus for a day of STEM activities and lab tours, co-hosted by the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) campus group and ISIS Education, a local non-profit group in Davis aiming to increase girls participation in STEM.\r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of the research from this project include the overcoming of key technological challenges standing in the way of the successful establishment of a viable advanced biofuels industry, which is currently the most promising and sustainable transportation fuel alternative to fossil fuels. The broader impact of the education plan of this project is to help increase the numbers of women in the STEM workforce by engaging school-aged girls in STEM activities.",

Although much work in the field focuses on developing superior enzymes for the reaction, our goal for this project was to better understand how the complex and insoluble substrate limits the reaction. The enzymatic release of structural sugars from cellulosic biomass involves the physical diffusion of enzymes via micrometer scale pores in the biomass structure and complexation of the enzymes to reactive sites on the biomass surfaces to hydrolyze bonds and release sugars. Through the course of this project, we examined cellulase-cellulose interactions at the single-molecule scale, measured nanometer-scale changes to the structure and organization of cellulose fibrils and measured the physical constraint of water within the microporous biomass structure. From our work, we have learned that the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose is largely insensitive to molecular-scale enzyme-substrate interactions. Rather, the reaction bottleneck is tied to the properties of the insoluble cellulose fibrils. With insights from our experiments, we have developed a working mechanistic model for the hydrolysis of cellulose that incorporates the changing insoluble substrate that is a consequence of enzyme-substrate interactions. As we continue our research, this mechanistic model is the basis for engineering design of the bioconversion process as we continue to endeavor to improve reaction efficiencies while minimizing costly enzyme loadings. This project has trained one M.S. and two Ph.D. Biological System Engineering students and one Chemical Engineering Ph.D. student (3 females and one male student) at the University of California Davis. Students were given opportunities to work closely with collaborators from the Los Alamos National Laboratory&rsquo;s Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and from the University of Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>During this project period, STEM for Girls, an annual STEM outreach to 10 &ndash; 12 year old girls was established at UC Davis. The goal of STEM for Girls is to increase retention of girls in STEM by providing positive experiences and role models in STEM. Partnerships were formed with neighboring school districts in Sacramento and Woodland, CA, to invite 50 &ndash; 60 underserved and underrepresented girls to campus each year for a day of workshops and lab/facility tours. Between 2012 &ndash; 2016, STEM for Girls hosted nearly 300 girls, with measureable increases in their interest in long term pursuit of STEM, their sense of belonging in STEM and their identification of STEM role models. Although longitudinal impact studies has been outside of the scope of this project, a survey conducted with a small group of participants one-year later showed they were significantly more likely to imagine themselves going to college, wanting to come back the next year, admiring someone in STEM, and imagining themselves in STEM. These results suggest a lasting positive impact by STEM for Girls.</p>\n<p>In addition to outreach to underserved girls in our greater community, STEM for Girls also builds community amongst STEM student, staff and faculty (50 &ndash; 100 volunteers per year) on the UC Davis campus. The events, fully organized and run by UC Davis volunteers, have provided leadership opportunities to event organizers, workshop and tour leaders and valuable networking opportunities for all participants. The STEM for Girls events have also served as research subjects for a senior undergraduate honors thesis and a Ph.D. dissertation in human ecology. Students have presented analyses of the impact of the one-day STEM intervention program at national meetings of the Western Psychological Association, Understanding Interventions that Broaden Participation in Science Careers and the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research.</p>\n<p>This CAREER project has brought forth critical insights into the role of the insoluble biomass substrate in its hydrolysis by enzymes. These are insights critical to mainstreaming the cellulosic biofuels and bioproducts industry to offset petroleum-based products. This project has also facilitated the establishment of a viable and growing outreach STEM program at UC Davis.
