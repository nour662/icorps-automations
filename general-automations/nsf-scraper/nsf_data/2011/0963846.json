The workshop brings together junior researchers and leading mathematicians working in the areas of nonlinear partial differential equations, fluid dynamics, shock waves, general relativity, and differential geometry.  The conference aims to stimulate research inspired by recent fundamental advances in these fields and to educate young researchers about these recent developments.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop will enhance communication among junior and senior researchers in applied nonlinear partial differential equations.  Lectures will be posted on the conference web site.  The conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students, junior researchers, and members of under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/conferences/npnp2010/index.html",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe thrust of my research has been concerned with mathematical questions involving gravity arising in astrophysics.  Specifically, there arre three areas:  A)  I am investigating whether rotating black holes are stable under various perturbations; that is if we send an electromagnetic wave or a gravitational wave into the black hole, will the black hole undergo small changes, or will it radiate away a significant amount of its mass.  This  problem constitutes a major step in our understanding  the structure of a bkack hole. In previous work, I proved that it is theoretically possible to extract energy from from a rotating black hole, and so maybe someday we can figure out how to capture this energy.  B) In my recent work I have put forth a new cosmological model which gives a theoretical explanation of the so-called \"anomalous acceleration of the universe\". (It was shown by astronomers in the 1990's that the universe is not only expanding, but expanding faster and faster.)  This discovery needed an explanation.  Physicists explained it by postulatingthe existence  \"dark energy\", an unobserved anti-gravitational force. My collaborator Blake Temple and I found a possible explanation based on Einstein's theory of general relativity.  Indeed, we showed that the anomalous acceleration of the universe can be explained by new solutions of Einstein's equations, which we discovered.  And our theory avoids the use of dark energy.  C)  I have been studying the equations which describe stars like our Sun, whereby I also take magnetic effects into account; this has never been done before mathematically.  Magnetic fields in the interior of the Sun are said to be thecause of solar flares: spectacular erruptive phenomena in the coronal region of the Sun.  I recently proved the existence of stars with magnetic fields.  My goal is to obtain how solar flares arise in stars.\n\nMy research during the period of thei NSF grant has been to address important problems involving the stability of black holes, the anomalous acceleration of the universe, and magnetic stars.  These problems are considered in a mathemaically rigorous manner, with an aim to lead to a broader understanding of these interesting phenomena.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/04/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joel A Smoller"
