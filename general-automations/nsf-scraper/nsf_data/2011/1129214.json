 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Integrated Undergraduate Training in Mathematics and Life Sciences at North Carolina State University (NCSU) is to attract and train undergraduates in mathematics and life sciences for academic and nonacademic careers at the interface between mathematics and the life sciences. Galileo argued that the laws of nature are mathematical.  Today, some 40 decades later, cutting edge research at the forefront of life sciences has become more dependent on mathematical, computational, and statistical methodologies. The proposed UBM program uses a multi-faceted approach to prepare next generation of mathematicians and scientists that will meet the holistic, multi-disciplinary research problems of the 21st century.  The program engages in cutting edge, significant, cross-disciplinary research; successful, well established curricular and support programs; as well as exciting, novel, new initiatives. Its aim is to provide a comprehensive, challenging, yet supportive academic environment for students in mathematical and life sciences designed to ensure their success.  \r\n\r\nThe NCSU UBM team is truly interdisciplinary, with members in mathematics, biomathematics, statistics, biology, chemistry, veterinary medicine and medicine.  This powerful combination of areas of expertise offers a truly unique cross-disciplinary educational experience for undergraduates in life sciences and mathematics. The results of the proposed UBM program will provide a vehicle for systemic institutional change in introductory mathematics and science education. Since project leadership includes key members of existing academic units on campus, the project is set to implement these reforms from inside of existing structures. The program will provide important professional development courses for many NCSU students and will recruit diverse students from many groups that are currently under-represented in mathematics and the life sciences.",
