It consists of two pieces: a deep, multi-band map covering 5000 square degrees, and a \"cosmic movie\" of a thirty square-degree region obtained by revisiting that area at least once every six nights.  The wide-area survey will measure positions, shapes, fluxes, and approximate (photometric) redshifts for around 300 million galaxies, and the time-domain survey will discover and measure light curves for several thousand supernovae and other transients.  Data will be collected during five annual, six-month observing seasons, beginning in September 2012, with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a new wide-field, facility instrument built by the DES collaboration that will be installed in late 2011 at the prime focus of the Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.\r\n\r\nThe raw survey data must be processed efficiently into scientifically useful products that are served to the DES collaboration to enable the science goals.  With previous NSF support, the project has constructed the Dark Energy Survey Data Management (DESDM) system so as to meet the DES Science Requirements.  This system will be finished and operated as part of carrying out the DES.  The work will be done mainly at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, with important contributions from the University of Pennsylvania and from the Institut d'Astrophysique in Paris.  This award supports the major operational expense, that of the personnel, with small hardware costs for storage and database needs.  The core processing will be mainly carried out using Grid resources supported separately by NSF.  A small amount of funding is also provided to help with project coordination at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.\r\n\r\nDES data will be made public, providing a rich legacy that will enable numerous archival research projects in astronomy that can confidently be predicted to go far beyond the scientific goals of the DES.  Such confidence is merited by noting the high impact and broad community use of an earlier survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and realizing that the DES data will be substantially deeper, have higher angular resolution, and extend to longer wavelengths than the SDSS imaging.  The DESDM data products will be \"science-ready,\" with high-precision photometric and astrometric calibrations, and will include single-epoch and co-added images and derived object catalogs, all served from an easily accessible database compliant with international virtual observatory standards.\r\n\r\nInformation about the many thousands of transients expected to be found by the time-domain survey will be made public immediately, to enable follow-up by other researchers.  The availability and quality of the DES data will also impact the public understanding of research, and the DESDM team itself will be working with a local program for middle-school girls and with the Adler Planetarium, among others, to pursue these education and outreach possibilities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Dark Energy Survey (DES) is an ongoing experiment at the Blanco Telescope on Cerro Tololo in Chile taking detailed images of a large swath of the southern sky.  DES data will be used for many different science applications, but the principal goal is to try to learn more about \"dark energy\", a rather unhelpful name that astronomers give to the fact that the universe seems to be accelerating in its expansion, rather than slowing down from the force of gravity as we had expected. The survey is planned for 5 observing seasons from August to February, the first season being 2013-14.  By the end, it is expected have taken images of hundreds of millions of galaxies, covering approximately 1/8 of the entire sky.\nOne of the key physics tools that we use in DES to study dark energy is called weak gravitational lensing, which is when the gravity of the various massive objects in the universe distort the images of more distant galaxies, making them appear slightly stretched relative to their initial shape.  It is a very subtle effect, but using careful statistical methods on those observed galaxy shapes, we can learn a lot about the distribution of mass in the universe, which implicitly tells us about the nature of dark energy.\nThis project's focus was to develop the tools necessary to create and validate catalogs of those galaxy shapes.  We used \"science verification\" data taken with the same telescope and camera in fall 2012, the year before DES officially started.  Most of the hard work involved accounting for and removing all of the many other effects (from the atmosphere, the telescope, the detector, etc.) that can cause the galaxy image to appear slightly stretched, but which have nothing to do with gravitational lensing.  These so-called systematic errors would lead to errors in the subsequent science analyses that used the measurements, if they were not accounted for properly.\nThe principal outcome of this project was the production of shape catalogs for this science verification data, which covers 137 square degrees (less than 3% of the area that the full DES will eventually cover).  The catalogs include reliable shape measurements for over 3 million galaxies at distances up to around 9 billion light years from Earth.  Numerous science projects have now used these catalogs producing a number of interesting results, including dark energy and cosmology, but also investigations of how closely the mass in the universe matches up with the locations of observed clusters of galaxies, how empty the least dense locations in the universe are, and even how galaxies get gravitationally captured when they fall into a cluster of galaxies by looking at a specific signature in the mass profile called the \"splash back\" radius.  Since the data have all been made publicly available (see the URL below), we expect and hope that more researchers around the world will download and use the data for other studies that we haven't thought of. \nThe other, more technical, result of this project has been the development of some important new tools and methods for detecting and removing systematic errors in weak lensing shape measurements.  We believe that this work represents the most thorough analysis of such systematic errors of any similar work to date.  We are confident, based on what we've learned during this project, that when DES completes its five years of observations, we will be able to produce an accurate catalog of close to 200 million shapes, hopefully leading to some exciting discoveries about nature and properties of the dark matter and dark energy that make up most of the total mass/energy in the universe.\n \nhttps://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/releases/sva1\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/08/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert M Jarvis"
