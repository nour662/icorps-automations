 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to develop a scheme based on\r\na novel dual-membrane-structure (DMS) configuration to \r\nmitigate mechanical shocks for MEMS sensors and actuators,\r\nwhich constitutes an outstanding problem in MEMS research. For \r\nexample, in order to maximize the sensitivity of an existing MEMS\r\nmicrophone, the distance between the diaphragm and backplate needs\r\nto be small and the membrane should be thin, rendering the device\r\nparticularly vulnerable to external shocks. The DMS configuration \r\nrepresents an intrinsic, self-sustained, practically implementable \r\ncontrol scheme to counter mechanical shocks. A comprehensive \r\ntheoretical/computational/experimental paradigm based on MEMS\r\nphysics, nonlinear and synchronization analyses will be established\r\nto validate the proposed approach.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is that the strongly interdisciplinary \r\nresearch will result in novel impact-protected MEMS devices with \r\nnonlinear control. The research will lead to a new class of \r\nMEMS sensors and actuators with ultra-reliable performances.\r\nThe theoretical/computational/experimental paradigm required to \r\nrealize the proposed research is transformative to developing\r\nMEMS devices in biomedical, industrial, defense and homeland-security   \r\napplications. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are (1) to advance significantly understanding \r\nof the fundamental dynamics of small-scale systems, (2) to enable \r\nhigh-performance applications of robust MEMS devices in a broad \r\nrange of fields, and (3) to create an exciting environment for graduate \r\nand undergraduate students in terms of interdisciplinary awareness and \r\nskills.",
