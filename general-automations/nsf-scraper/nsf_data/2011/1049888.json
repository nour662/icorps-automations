 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the considerable amount of research conducted in collisional mountain belts over the past few decades, little consensus has been reached regarding the influence that climatic and tectonic processes have on the surface, or how these processes are intertwined. Recent studies in the central Himalaya - a well studied, archetypal collisional mountain belt - have produced conflicting ideas regarding what is the most significant control on surface processes. Farther to the east, the Bhutan Himalaya have not been studied in much detail, but are often labeled as an outlier when compared to the classic Himalayan form and geology. However, the apparently anomalous features of Bhutan make it an excellent environment to test some of the outstanding hypotheses regarding the interplay of climate, tectonics and surface processes. Atypical high-elevation, but low-relief landscapes are perched above and surrounded by deeply incised canyons in the middle latitudes of Bhutan. This study explores the proposition that these landforms represent a pulse of erosion that is sweeping through Bhutan and progressively changing the relief. Such a pulse of erosion signals a change in either tectonics or climate, or both and the characteristics of transient landscapes, including especially patterns of erosion rate, provide a framework to determine what the drivers for the change are. This research project focuses on determining basin-averaged millennial-scale erosion rates from the concentration of cosmogenic radionuclides within river sands. The sampling strategy will cover a wide range of mean annual precipitation, river channel steepness and basin relief. By combining these erosion rates with constraints from low-temperature thermochronology data, the research team will be able to discriminate between climate and tectonic-driven models in Bhutan and test hypotheses regarding the relationships between climate, erosion rate, topography and tectonics that carry implications well beyond the Bhutan field site.\r\n\r\nThe active nature of the problem addressed in this research has ramifications for many societal concerns including: seismic hazards, landslide hazards, sedimentation, reservoir management, navigability, soil erosion, and response to climate change. These issues are at times painfully clear to those who live in or near active mountain ranges throughout the world. Bhutan, because of its complicated political history and access issues, is one of the most poorly understood regions of the Himalaya. The research team is working closely with the National Environmental Commission of Bhutan to share findings in a meaningful way that better informs decisions in land use management and hazard mitigation. In addition, this research tackles fundamental problems in the understanding of mountain building. Many of the classic models of mountain building in collisional settings make predictions about the relative timing of fault activity; however, these assumptions have been shown to fail in some areas. The broad sample collection scheme will allow examination of uplift patterns across Bhutan to determine if these classic models hold true. Very little is known about the history of fault activity in Bhutan and therefore, any information regarding the pattern of uplift is invaluable to the governing bodies of Bhutan, who determine hazard assessment and control building codes.",
