This planning grant's results will determine the goals, objectives, activities, and outcomes for a future regional center spanning the State of Texas.  This project will produce a statewide community college mentorship model in which colleges are mentored to become leaders in energy workforce development and education.  This project will also investigate the possibility of cross-mapping existing energy skill standards, determine if new skill standards are needed, and investigate the best ways to constantly review and update standards based on the needs of the industry and changes in policy.  Both cross-mapping and the mentoring model could be adopted and adapted by other states or a consortium of states.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF Award #1103578\nExpanding Community College Leadership to Meet Rapid Changes in Energy Education (Planning Grant)\n\nObjectives\n\nFor this Planning Grant, we determined the need for and feasibility of a National Science Foundation Advanced Technological Education Community College Energy Center for the state of Texas.  This study involves various energy stakeholders, including those in education, government and industry to perform the following:\n\nAssess the demand for technicians in various energy fields and the training qualifications needed for each field.\nAssess the capability of Austin Community College (ACC) and its partners to meet the demand in those energy fields and meet the training qualifications for each field. \nPerform a gap analysis that determines the strengths and weaknesses of the coalition to address the energy technician demand and qualifications. \nMake recommendations that address any weaknesses found and determine whether a proposal for such an Energy Center is appropriate at this time.\n\n\nData Study\n\nWe studied regional workforce hiring trends for future industry energy needs.\nThis included commissioning a study by SkillsNet, a company that combines a quantitative orientation with theories and methods available in the behavioral and social sciences.  Since Oil and Gas Technology is mature and is addressed across the state of Texas, particularly in the Houston / Beaumont area, we will not address Oil and Gas as one of our targeted occupations for study. The six occupations that we studied were:\n\n Solar Photovoltaic Installers\nSolar Thermal Installers \nWind Turbine Service Technician \nBiofuel &amp; Biomass Plant Technicians \nElectrical Power-Line Installers \nElectrical Equipment Repairers (Powerhouse, Relay, Substation)        \n\n\nProject Outcomes\n\nThe gap analysis that we performed shows that the industry demand for these selected occupations is strong only for Electrical Power-Line Installer. At this time, demand for the other occupations studied is either flat or premature for educational program development. Therefore, the existing program at ACC for the Lineworker specialization, which offers certificates and the associate degree, addresses the requirements listed in the Detailed Work Activity (DWA) and Knowledge, Skill and Ability (KSA) profiles for this\noccupation. In addition, Austin Community had already performed a joint analysis of this program with other programs within the Electronics and Advanced Technologies department.\n\nAustin is one of the leading cities in the U.S. with respect to green energy and would be well positioned to expand and enhance the Renewable Energy Technician program when the demand increases. Also, the state of Texas is unique in that it has its own independent energy grid and employs a variety of energy sources. As the various energy technologies mature, Texas is also well positioned to host a regional energy center.\n\nThe network of colleges willing to partner in the various energy areas have existing curricula to address each of the occupations studied as well as strong programs focused on Oil and Gas Technology. \n\nRecommendations \n\nGiven that the regional demand for Solar Technicians is low and that the Wind Turbine Technician demand is rather localized to specific areas of the state, the most promising programs for curriculum development are our Power Technology and Utility Lineworker programs. ACC is partnering with Texas State Technical College to analyze these programs under the auspices of a Perkins Grant to provide Learning Outcomes Alignment using detailed occupational skills.\n\nIt is our conclusion that given the results of our data study, industry input and\ngap analysis, a Texas Regional ATE Energy Center, as originally described, is not justified at this time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul Potier"
