This workshop is to be done partially in response to the America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2010, which calls for the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish a Green Chemistry Basic Research program to award competitive, merit-based grants to support research into green and sustainable chemistry.  This workshop addresses the society's critical need for safer, economical, and more environmentally sustainable chemical products and processes.  This one-day workshop will engage about 20 technical experts drawn from both industry and academe to discuss the most pressing questions and greatest technical and research opportunities related to sustainable chemistries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOn April 28, 2011, the National Research Council\u00c6s Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology held a workshop titled  \"Basic Research to Advance Sustainable Chemistry.\"  36 people were in attendance, including 11 from industrial firms, 14 from universities, and the remainder from government agencies or non-profits.  In addition to these in-person participants, over 120 researchers participated remotely via webcast.\n\nThe purpose of the day was to bring together industrial and academic researchers to discuss what precompetitive basic research problems the industrial sector needs solved in order to move its business to better environmental sustainability while remaining competitive internationally.   Academic researchers gained knowledge of the research needs of their industrial colleagues, and the industrial participants gained new insight into the research going on at our nation\u00c6s universities.  The needs in four industrial sectors were discussed:  traditional chemical industry, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and consumer products.  Speakers from industry discussed topics such as sustainable raw material sources, reduction of toxicity of raw materials and end products, and product end-of-life issues such as recycling or reuse of materials.\n\nThe workshop achieved the exchange of scientific information on questions of importance to the societal goal of environmentally sustainable manufacturing and commerce.  A recap of the meeting discussions can be found at http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/bcst/miscellaneous/Sustainable_Chem_Recap.pdf\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/05/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dorothy Zolandz"
