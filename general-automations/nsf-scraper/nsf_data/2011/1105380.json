Of particular interest to this project is the study of quantum criticality, a type of material behavior that indicates that a phase transformation is occurring at the absolute zero of temperature. The project also seeks to understand novel states of frustrated magnetic materials such as \"spin liquids\" and non-magnetic \"hidden order\" phases. The study of the effects of magnetic disordered in the behavior of newly synthesized metallic glasses is the third focal point of this project. The techniques used in the project to study these \"strongly correlated\" materials are mainly nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon spin rotation (muSR). Examples of materials that will be studied are: Yb3Pt4 (quantum criticality), Pr2Zr2O7 and Pr2Ir2O7 (frustrated magnetism), and bulk metallic glasses doped with Gd (disordered magnetic states). The project experiments will be carried out with the participation of CSULA students, both locally and at user facilities in Canada and the USA. A collaboration with CSULA Physics Department's University Preparatory Program (UPP) will be implemented to engage UPP students in summer research internships. Science field trips and general physics laboratory exercises for inner city high school students will be carried out in this collaboration to provide minority students with hands-on experiences. The project will facilitate the participation in research and science fairs of motivated students from neighboring Alhambra High School.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\nThe project is aimed at understanding phase transformations and the appearance of new phases of matter in novel solids and fluids. Interesting new states of matter derive from the collective behavior of strongly interacting atomic particles in the interior of a suitable material. The project studies the behavior of these materials at very low temperatures. The three main phenomena to study go by the names of \"quantum criticality,\" \"frustrated magnetism,\" and \"magnetic disorder.\" The techniques used in the project to study these \"strongly correlated\" materials will be mainly nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon spin rotation (muSR). Understanding these phenomena is of fundamental importance for the development of new and improved materials for potential applications in the future. The project activities will be carried out with the participation of CSULA students, both locally and at user facilities in Canada and the USA. A collaboration with CSULA Physics Department's University Preparatory Program (UPP) will be implemented to engage UPP students in summer research internships. Science field trips for inner city high school students will be carried out in this collaboration to increase awareness of science and technology, while providing minority students with hands-on experiences. Motivated students from neighboring Alhambra High School will participate in research and the project will promote their involvement in science fairs at state and national levels.",

We trained undergraduate and masters level students as well as created opportunities for students from local area high schools to be involved in outreach activities. Under our program, several undergraduate students graduated with experience that allowed them to move on to graduate school at R1 universities, other continued their education at Cal State LA pursuing masters degrees, and at least one more was able to start working full-time in an industrial job, while continuing his graduate education locally. Similarly several master level students were able to graduate and provide evidence of their research experience that allowed them to be admitted in PhD programs.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nIntellectual Merit: This award funded research at the California State University, Los Angeles CSULA, an undergraduate and masters MS-level state university located in the heart of Los Angeles. Projects were carried out that contributed to the field of Condensed Matter Physics in collaborations with faculty and students from UC Riverside, UC San Diego, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, National High Magnetic Field Lab (NHMFL), Tallahassee, Florida, Fudan University in Shanghai, China, and Fresno State University. The projects involved nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon spin relaxation (muSR) experiments. These are spectroscopic techniques that complement each other. NMR was carried out at CSULA and the NHMFL and muSR at user facilities abroad (the USA doesn?t have muSR facilities): Tri-University Meson Factory (TRIUMF) in Vancouver, Canada; Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Villigen, Switzerland; Rutherford Appleton Lab (ISIS) in Ditcot, UK and Japan Proton Accelerator Complex (J-PARC) in Tokai, Japan. Research aimed at understanding current frontier topics in correlated-electron materials: Inhomogeneous Magnetism (UCu4Pd and UCu4Ni), Fermi and non-Fermi Liquid Behavior (Yb3Pt4), Heavy-Fermion Superconductivity (CeCoIn5), Interplay between Magnetism and Superconductivity (Pr/Nd Skutterudites), New Superconductors (BiS2-layered superconductors), New Ground States of Matter (Pr2+xIr2-xO7+d). Image-1 summarizes outcomes for UCu4Pd and UCu4Ni: combination of muSR and NMR on the left panel showed that the magnetic susceptibility in UCu4Pd is inhomogeneously distributed. That?s indicated by the solid line where muSR and NMR coincide. In UCu4Ni, there are two inequivalent NMR signals both of which confirm the presence of inhomogeneous magnetism. We found differences in the correlation length of the disorder at two different locations within the unit cell, in contrast with the Pd case, where the correlation length doesn?t depend on probe location. Image-2 shows how our muSR discovered static order in Yb3Pt4 where wiggles in the muon relaxation are clearly observed. Moreover, the behavior of the muon dynamic relaxation indicates that the low-T state is a Fermi Liquid with an unusual suppression of spin fluctuations and the appearance of inhomogeneous relaxation with application of magnetic fields. Image-3 shows how muSR can be used to extract superconducting properties of unconventional superconductors such as CeCoIn5. Thanks to this award the PI was able to participate in the research that led to the confirmation of theorist Chandra Varma?s earlier work on the renormalization of mass and other parameters in heavy-fermion superconductors by measuring the London penetration length. Image-4 shows, on the left panel, the phase diagram of Pr/Nd-substituted skutterudites. In the region near x=0.5, there seems to be coexistence of the two phases. For x=0.25, however, we observed two types of transitions depending on the method used to measure the relaxation. As can be seen, on the right-hand panel, one can extract the superconducting transition temperature from the behavior of the transverse relaxation rate and it coincides with what is obtained by other methods. In the longitudinal mode, we did not detect an enhancement until well below the superconducting transition temperature indicating that magnetism might be setting in well into the superconducting state. The Pr-Iridate compound Pr2Ir2O7 is a highly frustrated magnet whose low-T state appears to be that of a chiral spin liquid. It undergoes a magnetic Hall Effect in zero-field, which is said to imply time reversal symmetry breaking TRSB without magnetic order. Image-5 shows that when there is an excess Pr, a magnetic transition at about 0.8 K is found by neutron scattering and thermodynamic measurements. In contrast, our muSR experiments in both the x=0 and x=0.1 samples found no evidence for magnetic order; unstable spin-ice order was found instead.\n\n \n  \nBroader Impacts: Image-6: thanks to the funding provided through this award, the PI was able to promote the involvement of minority groups in scientific research. Our students come from diverse backgrounds and from areas of the city that have been historically underrepresented in physics. We trained undergraduate and masters level students as well as created opportunities for students from local area high schools to be involved in outreach activities. Under our program, several undergraduate students graduated with experience that allowed them to move on to graduate school at R1 universities, other continued their education at Cal State LA pursuing masters degrees, and at least one more was able to start working full-time in an industrial job, while continuing his graduate education locally. Similarly several master level students were able to graduate and provide evidence of their research experience that allowed them to be admitted in PhD programs. Lastly, of the six high-school interns we were able to support through summer internships, two went on to study physics. Our intellectual products were disseminated via peer-reviewed publications which will remain in the literature to guide and stimulate further work in the sciences and engineering fields. We developed infrastructure and data analysis tools for future research and to guide the work of new students in the field of materials science.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/16/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Oscar O Bernal"
