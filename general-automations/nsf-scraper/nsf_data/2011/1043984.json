 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is implementing a program for increasing the adoption of technology-enhanced active learning in classes taught by science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty. Student-centered active learning techniques and incorporation of technology into teaching are identified as having positive effects on learning in STEM disciplines. However, barriers to these approaches - including lack of time, institutional support, and training, as well as the prevalence of traditional classrooms designed for passive lectures prevent their broad adoption. This project addresses those barriers by:  1) Facilitating the implementation of technologically-enhanced active learning by developing a cohort of six STEM focal point faculty (Catalysts) who immerse themselves in active learning pedagogy, redesign their own courses, and serve as models for their peers, 2) Establishing a student-centered technology-rich studio classroom designed to support active learning pedagogy, and 3) Assessing the effectiveness of technologies used in active learning pedagogy in order to provide best practice recommendations. These efforts increase the incorporation of active learning into all STEM disciplines at the university. Information and lessons learned are shared with other institutions through publications, an online teaching commons, and conference presentations. The Catalyst program for facilitating adoption of active learning techniques is replicable, enhancing the likelihood of transformational change in STEM education and broadening participation in the sciences. The studio classroom design is based on existing active classroom methodology and, by sharing the assessment of its technological innovations, will further the development of this area of education.",
