 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop resources for STEM learning by \r\nredesigning and expanding the \"Jonathan Bird's Blue World\" website; adding \r\ncomponents to enable teachers and students to search episodes for specific \r\nthemes, locations, or scientific concepts; and enhancing the lesson plans to \r\nexplicitly match the content standards for teaching science.\r\n\r\nOne of the major objectives is to make the \"Jonathan Bird's Blue World\" web \r\nsite content more widely accessible as an open source via an internet \r\nconnection with a dynamic search capability. The project adds a significant \r\namount of educational material and uses ocean topics to illustrate nationally \r\naccepted standards for science learning. It is applicable to both formal and \r\ninformal environments and contains a multi-faceted approach to achieve its \r\ngoal including the following objectives: (a) build a web site search \r\ncapability that includes National Science Educational Standards\r\n(NSES) and Ocean Literacy Principles with a link to segments illustrating \r\nspecific NSES; (b) create webisodes that feature specific NSES and develop an \r\ninteractive map on the web site; (c) create a user survey tool and outreach for \r\nthese improvements.\r\n\r\nBy partnering with researchers and educators to incorporate nationally \r\naccepted standards for science learning into the website redesign, the project \r\nhas a broad impact on professional development for teachers. It has the \r\npotential to reach diverse audiences in schools, homes and afterschool \r\nprograms. \"Jonathan Bird's Blue World\" is designed to complement other \r\neducational materials and provide a useful resource for teachers everywhere, \r\nimproving public scientific literacy in informal and formal settings.",
