 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is funded to achieve the overarching goal quantifying the properties, variability and momentum fluxes of short period (<1 hour) mesospheric gravity waves and their dominant sources and effects over the Antarctic continent. These measurements are of high importance as gravity waves having small horizontal scales and large amplitudes and momentum fluxes are known to provide the majority of the mean and variable forcing in the mesosphere. Exploratory airglow studies from Antarctica have revealed a wealth of mesospheric wave activity and strong anisotropy in wave propagation headings and associated large differences in momentum fluxes at different sites. As these results suggest strong regional variability, the overall impact of gravity waves on the mesospheric dynamics over the vast Antarctic continent remains unknown. It is proposed to implement an international ANtarctic Gravity Wave Imaging Network (ANGWIN) that will provide an exceptional capability for investigating mesospheric gravity waves at selected sites encompassing the entire Antarctic continent. This network will capitalize on existing optical and radar measurement capabilities at eight well-established national research stations, strategically located around the continental coast at Halley Bay (UK), Syowa (Japan), Davis (Australia), McMurdo and South Pole (USA), and Rothera (UK), Ferraz (Brazil), Vernadsky (Ukraine) on the Antarctic Peninsula. As part of this project, the infrared (IR) all-sky mesospheric OH imagers will be installed at Davis, McMurdo, and Halley, and an all-sky near-IR imager at Vernadsky to augment the existing instrumentation and create an unprecedented capability for studying gravity wave properties at each site. It is important that ANGWIN create a novel opportunity for the international Antarctic research community to work together producing \"high impact\" science well above that which can be achieved individually. It is anticipated that the proposed collaborative imaging network will contribute substantially to graduate student education, both within the U.S. and abroad, and will lead to significant new research opportunities for graduate students.",
