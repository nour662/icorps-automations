Vold and Gina Hoatson from the\r\nCollege of William and Mary and their graduate and undergraduate student colleagues\r\nwill develop realistic models for simulating slow molecular motion, apply them to new\r\ntypes of nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, and make the modeling and data\r\nfitting procedures easily accessible and freely available to the general scientific\r\ncommunity. On line documentation, to be developed as part of this project, will include\r\ntutorials on experimental procedures, illustrated by animated simulations of typical\r\nexperiments. This will provide a generally useful teaching tool for introducing students to\r\npractical aspects of spectroscopy, even in situations where expensive, high field\r\ninstrumentation is not readily available.\r\n\r\nThe work of Prof. Vold, Prof. Hoatson and their research colleagues and\r\nresearch students will enable scientists to study a broader range of materials, and to\r\nanalyze some of the very slow motions that are important in determining such useful\r\nproperties as increased sensitivity of ultrasonic detectors. In addition to the broader\r\nscientific impact of the proposed work, the students being trained in this project will be\r\nexposed to unique interdisciplinary research.",
