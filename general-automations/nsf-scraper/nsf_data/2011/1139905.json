 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas A&M University System (TAMUS) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority\r\nParticipation (LSAMP) will sponsor a Bridge to the Doctorate Program (BD) at Texas\r\nA&M University during the 2011-2013 academic years. The program involves\r\ncollaboration with the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (COALS), the College of\r\nScience (COS), and the College of Engineering (COE) at the institution as well as\r\nparticipation in research projects at partner institutions such as TAMU-Kingsville.\r\n\r\nThe TAMUS LSAMP BD Program aims to increase the pool of science, technology,\r\nengineering or mathematics STEM PhDs among underrepresented minorities (URM) in\r\nSTEM fields and to create a cohesive community of graduate students across different\r\ndisciplines within the university. The program benefits society by providing opportunities and activities at graduate levels that lead to educational and career enhancements of graduate students. The\r\nTAMUS LSAMP BTD program will also enhance the infrastructure of research and\r\neducation by advancing pursuit of graduate and doctoral STEM degrees at alliance\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nSince 2003, the alliance has conducted the NSF LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate postbaccalaureate program at this institution and Prairie View A&M University for seven cohorts of students from historically underrepresented groups pursuing STEM doctoral degrees.  Eleven (11) students have completed STEM doctoral programs and 16 students have completed STEM M. S. degrees.  The remaining students are still persisting at the postbaccalaureate level or have entered STEM Ph.D. programs.",
