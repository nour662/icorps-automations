 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Raman-shifted Eye-safe Aerosol Lidar (REAL) observing platform, now based at the California State University at Chico, was originally designed and assembled with support from NSF and NCAR (the National Center for Atmospheric Research).  It supports a combination of lower-atmospheric research and university-based instruction led by the Principal Investigator.  REAL operates at a wavelength 1.54 microns, and is capable of mapping distributions of urban pollutants and naturally occurring dusts/aerosols.  By tracking the movement of aerosol features, REAL provides high-resolution depictions of air motions adjacent to the earth's surface, while backscatter depolarization of returned signals provides information on the shape of encountered particles.  This RAPID-type award will promptly support required refurbishment of high-precision mirrors used to accurately and efficiently direct lidar energy, and restore full functionality to REAL's beam steering unit.  Associated upgrades to site security will ensure reliable operation of the system at an off-campus CSU-Chico research farm location.  In-house design and fabrication of a small and portable crane will allow safe and reliable removal and replacement of the elevated beam steering unit from atop the shipping container in which REAL's transceiver and associated instrumentation reside.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this work rests in restoring and maintaining the ability of the REAL to collect high-quality observations, and adequate protection of the platform for future use.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of this effort will include increased safety for students and staff involved in REAL's operation, and its continued availability for support of on-site educational activities scheduled for early 2011.",
