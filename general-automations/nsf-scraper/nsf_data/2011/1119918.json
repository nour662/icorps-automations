 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theory predicts that geographically complex regions should harbor exceptional biological diversity, and that past Earth history events such as climatic fluctuations will affect the diversification and maintenance of genetic variation.  The island of Madagascar represents one such complex region.  Only four groups of native terrestrial mammals exist on Madagascar; each colonized Madagascar a single time and then diversified to exhibit spectacular morphological and ecological variation.  This proposal focuses on the small insectivore-like mammals, especially on those species distributed throughout Madagascar's mountainous, humid-forest belt.  The project will use DNA sequences from multiple genes to determine how many genetically distinct sets of populations exist within each species, and to provide an estimate of how long ago they diverged.  The researchers will use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to model the niche of each species using climatic data sets to estimate the species' current ranges and to reconstruct their distributions during past glacial cycles.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the forces that shape regional biodiversity is one of the key goals of modern biology.  This project will illuminate the importance of past climatic events in shaping present-day patterns of biodiversity.  It will reveal the extent of small-mammal diversity in Madagascar's humid forests and identify areas containing unexpected genetic variation, providing critical information for designing protected areas and conservation strategies in one of the world?s foremost biodiversity hotspots.  The researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students in DNA sequencing and analysis and GIS, including students from groups underrepresented in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNesomyines are an enigmatic group of rodents that are found only on the island of Madagascar.  The research aims of this project were to discover species limits and reconstruct evolutionary relationships (i.e. phylogeny) for nesomyines, with the goal of understanding how evolution occurred in an isolated adaptive radiation.  We refined species limits in the two most species-rich genera, Eliurus and Nesomys, discovering two new species in Eliurus and providing genetic evidence for the existence of three species in Nesomys.  We inferred a molecular phylogeny for Eliurus that was based on 7 genes sequenced from over 100 individuals.  This is the first hypothesis of evolutionary relationships for this group and allows us to infer how speciation has unfolded in Madagascar over the past 3-5 million years.  We confirmed the hypothesis that speciation in Eliurus (and in nesomyines more generally) has occurred primarily in the humid-forested, mountainous regions of the island, with only a few instances of speciation occurring with invasion of dry-forest habitats.  This suggests that species tend to track habitats over recent evolutionary time (\"niche-conservatism\") rather than adapt to new habitats (\"niche-evolution\"), and that climatic oscillations during the Pliocene and Pleistocene generated much of the species-level diversity of rodents on the island.\n\nIn addition, to begin to understand morphological evolution in this group, we generated microCT-scanned images of teeth for all nesomyine species.  Dental morphology is highly variable in this group (see figure), but tooth shape and function has never been adequately analyzed for nesomyines.  For the first time, we have quantified tooth-shape data that &mdash; when analyzed in the context of our phylogenies &mdash; allows us to address how this adaptive radiation has unfolded.  Intriguingly, most of the morphometric evolution (at least of teeth) has occurred in one of the two subclades of nesomyines.  This was an unexpected result, and has led to further research to characterize other traits in this clade, including cranial and postcranial morphology.\n\nTwo undergraduates (both honors students), two graduate students (one of whom is now in a tenure-track position; one is still working on the Ph.D.), and two technicians were supported and trained during the course of the project.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sharon A Jansa"
