 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mw=8.8 Maule earthquake off the coast of Chile on\r\nFebruary 27, 2010 is the 5th largest megathrust earthquake ever to be recorded and the 2nd\r\nlargest to be recorded by modern digital seismic networks. Immediately following the\r\nMaule earthquake, teams of seismologists from Germany, France, the UK, and the US,\r\nworking with seismologists in Chile, coordinated resources to deploy both broadband and\r\nshort period seismometers and accelerometers above the rupture zone to capture\r\naftershocks associated with this significant earthquake. Data recorded from these stations\r\nwill be combined to produce an open international community data volume providing an\r\nunprecedented opportunity to investigate processes associated with great earthquakes and\r\nto image the anatomy of a subduction zone. A defining characteristic of the Maule aftershock investigations\r\nhas been collaboration, at both national and international levels. The original involvement\r\nin the data collection by US teams grew voluntarily out of the IRIS community, and the\r\nrationale of greater efficiencies through cooperation was readily adapted by the five\r\ninternational groups working in the region.\r\n\r\nIn this project the researchers will carry out a broad but\r\ninterrelated spectrum of seismic analyses to the Maule international seismic data set,\r\nalong with a reanalysis of a selection of data collected in the rupture zone prior to the\r\nearthquake, to address some of the fundamental scientific objectives that motivated the\r\ninitial data collection. These objectives fall into two general categories: (1) rupture\r\nprocesses of megathrusts, and (2) active tectonics and dynamics of an oceanic-continental\r\n(Andean) margin. They intend to produce an internally consistent set of data products across a range of\r\nanalytical techniques. The PIs will share graduate students and scheduling extended visits to each others labs, thereby exposing students to a significantly broader range of experience than most students typically enjoy. Finally, they plan to engage our international colleagues by sharing some analysis tasks of mutual\r\ninterest. Data products generated by this study will be made available to the broader\r\ninternational community via a dedicated web site.",
