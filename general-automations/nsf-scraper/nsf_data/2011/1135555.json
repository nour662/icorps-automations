 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CI-TEAM Implementation Project, Cyberinfrastructure for Quality Understanding and Engagement for Students and Teachers (CyberQUEST) is implementing the successful strategies of a previous CI-TEAM Demonstration Project: San Diego CyberTEAM (OCI #0753422, 05/2008 - 10/2010) for broadening participation in cyber-activities through both teacher cyberinfrastructure (CI) expertise development and student CI-supported geosciences learning experiences at the middle school level. The CyberQUEST project is engaging 16 science teachers in a two-year program that includes week-long summer academies, Collaborative Lesson Study (CLS) rotations, ongoing mentoring and classroom support. The project nurtures a cadre of Lead Teachers who will be tasked with teaching future teachers in the CyberQUEST workshops. These Lead Teachers will also contribute to the iterative development and refinement of an innovative CI-enhanced geosciences curriculum for middle school. The curriculum units, referred to as TechQuest Lessons, provide technology (Tech) supported inquiries and investigations of concepts (Quests). Computer Science and Information Systems (CSIS) students at California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) will work with education, geosciences, and computing experts to develop resources that leverage existing CI-investments and provide customized access to CI-tools for TechQuest Lessons. The CyberQUEST project has partnered with education leaders within California (Riverside, Los Angeles and Sacramento) as well as in Arizona and New Mexico, to disseminate TechQuests through CyberQUEST Workshops. The CyberQUEST Workshops target eleven cohorts of 16 science teachers, referred to as Quest Teachers, from respective local schools identified by the partner education leaders. All teacher participants implement TechQuest Lessons in their classrooms, thus extending the project and impact. TechQuests focus on inquiry-based problem-solving science activities to enhance students? learning of abstract science concepts. In this way the CyberQUEST project engages middle school students from diverse populations in innovative use of emerging CI-tools. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The CyberQUEST leadership and partners comprise a highly qualified team of educational, technology, and science experts with proven successes spanning over five years in designing and implementing CI-enhanced classroom activities that impact science learning and prepare students and teachers as a cyber-ready workforce. Reinforcing STEM topics, these TechQuest lessons enhance CI skills for students and teachers and are developed, field tested, reviewed by experts, and refined over the project duration and sustained through partnerships. The integration of research and learning is incorporated into key components of the project. Innovative aspects of the project include: (1) customized units of instruction that engage students in scientific investigations using real-time data accessed over cyberinfrastructure, (2) collaboration among university, research institutions, national and state parks, and middle schools, to leverage CI investments, (3) quality controlled development and dissemination of classroom ready, CI-enhanced, teacher-created geosciences curriculum, (4) use of the open source Learning Management System, Moodle, to provide social networking elements that support collaborative learning communities. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The CyberQUEST project directly provides professional development for more than 192 science teachers in California, Arizona, and New Mexico from middle schools that serve high percentages of students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM careers. More than 10,000 middle school students will be engaged in CI-enhanced science learning activities and develop 21st century workforce skills as their teachers adopt the instructional strategies and CI skills gained from their professional development into classroom activities. Teachers will continue to impact workforce preparedness for additional students beyond the project duration and will further disseminate resources to teachers at their sites. TechQuest Lessons will be field-tested and refined in classrooms that serve populations of approximately 50% females and 50% minority students contributing to NSF?s initiatives of advancing understanding of how students from underrepresented groups learn science and are prepared to pursue STEM careers. The broad dissemination of the TechQuest Lessons through workshops and the project Web portal provide access to CI resources that enhance understanding of science concepts for adolescence far into the future. The project serves as a model for strong partnerships that supports integrated research and learning among multi-disciplinary groups of people and organizations.",

Four of these teachers became Lead Teachers and presented dissemination workshops to an additional 300 teachers over the next three years. Fifteen exemplary <em>TechQuest</em> lessons were developed, refined and published on the project Web site: <a href=\"http://www.csusm.edu/cyberquest\">www.csusm.edu/cyberquest</a>. These engaging lessons integrate Cyberinfrastructure (CI) tools and resources into scientific investigations using real-time data by students in grades 5-8. Example CI tools include Google Earth, Web 2.0 tools and Web-based simulations that bring exciting science opportunities into classrooms to prepare students as cyber-savvy workforce. Example <em>TechQuest</em> lesson topics focus on weather, matter, plate tectonics, heat transfer, energy and density. All teachers who attended dissemination workshops indicated they were likely to take at least half of the lessons (about 5) back to their students, representing more than 15, 000 students from classrooms in California, Arizona, New York and Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>As follow-up to CyberQUEST dissemination workshops, classroom observations were done in Arizona dissemination classrooms to document how effective the TechQuest lessons were being implemented. The project evaluator observed classrooms using the same protocol used for Project teachers. The findings were compared to the 14 observations conducted in Project classrooms a few weeks prior to the Arizona visits. Overall, the characteristics of Quest and Project classrooms were remarkably similar, despite differences in locale, grade levels, lesson content, technology, and teacher experience with the material. The similarities suggest that the units can be disseminated to willing teaches via dissemination workshops that do not include extensive ongoing support.</p>\n<p>In addition to the TechQuest lessons developed through the professional development of CyberQUEST, a Web based tool was created by the project to provide a collaborative environment for students and teachers to explore geographic locations. This tool allowed customization to meet teacher needs during students' science exploration and virtual fieldtrips. The CyberScavenger tool is set up to ensure that only students with appropriate credentials can capture and submit scavenger hunt evidence. In addition to the user name and password information provided by the student, the CyberScavenger app uses the GPS information of the phone to check student&rsquo;s location against fieldtrip boundaries set by their teacher. Students first answer questions posted by their teachers, then create a multiple-choice question for visitors to answer, and finally, they capture and submit their evidence. The app allows students to use built-in cameras to capture images on their phone. Approximately 75% of teachers who attended CyberQUEST workshops indicated they would use this tool in their classroom.</p>\n<p>The broad dissemination of TechQuest Lessons through workshops and the project Web portal will provide access to CI resources that enhance understanding of science concepts for adolescence students far into the future. The project&nbsp; serves as a model for strong partnerships that supports integrated research and learning among multi-disciplinary groups of people and organizations including university faculty in education and computer science and information systems, community partners such as Scripps Institution of Oceanography and California State Parks, and public and private schools in multiple states. In addition, project findings have been disseminated at state, national and international conferences.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Katherine&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hayden</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135555/1135555_10113070_1490643329849_simulationTool--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135555/1135555_10113070_1490643329849_simulationTool--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Simulation Tool\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135555/1135555_10113070_1490643329849_simulationTool--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Simulation Tool\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student uses simulation tool during a lesson exploring density.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Katherine Hayden</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katherine&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hayden</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Simulation Tool</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135555/1135555_10113070_1490643032684_Kilb--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135555/1135555_10113070_1490643032684_Kilb--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Science Expert Lecture\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135555/1135555_10113070_1490643032684_Kilb--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Science Expert Lecture\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Seismologist from Scripps Institution of Oceanography discusses plate tectonics during summer academy.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Katherine Hayden</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katherine&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hayden</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Science Expert Lecture</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135555/1135555_10113070_1490643225666_Park--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135555/1135555_10113070_1490643225666_Park--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Summer Fieldtrip to State Park\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135555/1135555_10113070_1490643225666_Park--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Summer Fieldtrip to State Park\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Project teachers attended an all day training at a California State Park on the beach to explore geological formations and to develop lessons using real data.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Katherine Hayden</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katherine&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hayden</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Summer Fieldtrip to State Park</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135555/1135555_10113070_1490642889057_CQTeachers--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135555/1135555_10113070_1490642889057_CQTeachers--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Teacher Training\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135555/1135555_10113070_1490642889057_CQTeachers--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Teacher Training\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Project Teachers received ongoing support over two years during professional development events.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kathy Hayden</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katherine&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hayden</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Teacher Training</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
