 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Herbst and his team continue their investigations of astrochemistry in different environments of the interstellar medium, ranging from chemistry in molecular clouds to stellar outflows from AGB stars to the formation of prebiotic molecules, and some types of extragalactic sources. The focus is on improved chemical simulations of regions that will be observed in detail by ALMA and other interferometers to study both the dynamics and heterogeneity of sources. The work is done with chemical network computations which include gas-phase reactions and gas-surface (ice) reactions, as well as kinetic considerations. \r\nObservations of molecular spectra of the interstellar medium can be analyzed to tell us about the physical conditions of the objects in which the molecules reside. In order to understand how molecules are formed and destroyed, the PI and his team have created large networks for chemical reactions which include both gas-phase and grain-surface processes. Coupled with physical models of sources, either homogeneous or heterogeneous, these chemical network computations are used to calculate molecular abundances both in the gas and on the surfaces of dust grains. A comparison with observational data then gives us information on physical conditions and lifetimes of sources.\r\nPostdoc and graduate student training is a vital part of this project. The work in astrochemistry by the PI has been important in the burgeoning use of molecules as probes of the interstellar medium in our galaxy and others. Much of the knowledge of diffuse and dense interstellar clouds now comes from an understanding of what molecules in these regions tell us. The field of molecular astronomy has become a worldwide endeavor in which observational astronomers, theoretical chemists, experimental scientists, and modelers collaborate on problems of mutual interest.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was based on the interdisciplinary science known as astrochemistry, which refers to the chemistry that occurs in regions other than the earth.  This subject is of interest to astronomers because molecules are excellent probes of the physical conditions (temperature, density) in regions where molecules are found, and of interest to chemists because the molecules found throughout the universe can be very exotic by terrestrial standards.   One manner in which molecules are used as probes is to understand the chemistry that they undergo &ndash; the rates of chemical reactions depend both on physical conditions and on the lifetime of the source.  Another way is to look at the characteristic radio and infrared frequencies that molecules emit &ndash; their so-called spectra &ndash; using spectrometers placed in telescopes, some of which need to be placed in orbit above our terrestrial atmosphere. \n\nThis project has been concerned mainly with the formation of new stars and planets, and what molecules in these regions can tell us about the details of the process.  Stars are formed in giant clouds of gas and dust that lie among the stars, in what astronomers refer to as the interstellar medium.  The clouds themselves form from gas and dust blown out of old stars, as they die.  The gas in the denser clouds is mainly molecular, and over 200 different types of molecules have been detected by their characteristic radio emissions.   The chemistry that forms and destroys molecules occurs both in the gas and on the surfaces of dust particles, and molecules can be detected in both of these phases. \n\nThe interstellar clouds are very cold, but as portions of these clouds begin to collapse they heat up until the material at the center of the collapse becomes hot enough to be labeled a new star while other matter from the collapse can form a swirling disk of gas and dust that surrounds the new star, especially when low-mass stars such as our sun are being formed.  The molecules detected in the cold clouds are very exotic, whereas the ones detected in warmer regions are more terrestrial in nature.  Eventually, over millions of years, the dust particles in the disk coalesce to become comets, meteors, asteroids, and finally planets.  In each stage of the collapse, the molecules found there, mainly using radio telescopes, are distinctive because the chemical processes that form them are different and lead to different outcomes.  So from the molecules detected in these stages and how abundant they are, we can tell what the pressure and temperature are and how long the stage lasts.  The stages we investigate depend upon the mass of the star being formed.  Low mass stars like the sun are born following an evolutionary sequence in which disks are prominent, whereas with high-mass stars, it is unclear whether disks ever form.\n\nTo attempt to mimic the chemistry that occurs at various stages from cold dense cloud to star formation, we construct simulations of the chemistry of many molecules using powerful computers and the physics as portions of interstellar clouds collapse and heat up.  Our simulations can be compared with models of the terrestrial atmosphere, atmospheres of other planets, and combustion processes. The list of all the chemical reactions we include in our simulations is known as a network.  For every molecule, we include the chemistry of its formation and its destruction. Each year, more reactions are added to the network with rates measured in the laboratory.  For each molecule, formation and destruction reactions are inserted into differential equations that, when solved, tell us concentrations as a function of  time and different physical conditions.  The calculated concentrations can be compared with observed values.  The best agreement between observations and calculated concentrations tells us the most likely physical conditions and age of the source being studied.\n\nSome more specific projects we have worked on during the ..."
