The portable nature of the wind tunnel mescosm (PI-SWERL) will allow for large numbers of spatially detailed measurements of wind effects on mineral dust emissions to the atmosphere with implications for improved models to inform a better understanding of eolian processes in arid environments, the impacts of desertification on human health, and improved agricultural soil conservation efforts.\r\n\r\n***",

Undergraduate student training in research will make students more competitive for graduate school or employment upon graduation. The primary investigator of this grant has applied for additional funding to support field-based projects using the PI-SWERL.

Initial testing of the equipment found it to be in proper working order. In July 2012, the first research project using the new PI-SWERL was started on the Missouri National Recreational River (MNRR) managed by the National Park Service. In 2011, floods along the Missouri River deposited vast areas of new sand bars. These sand bars became sources of sand and dust on windy days. We used the PI-SWERL to quantify the amount of sand and dust generated from the sand bars. This data can be used to assess air quality impacts along the MNRR, assess negative impacts to habitat nesting on sand bars, and determine if dust emitted from sand bars could have been an ancient source for dust that accumulated to form the nearby Loess Hills. This project includes the training of an undergraduate student in research, and is still in progress. Additional projects using the PI-SWERL are in the planning stages.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/02/2012<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mark&nbsp;R&nbsp;Sweeney</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2012/1029116/1029116_10111608_1349187438162_DSCN2094--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2012/1029116/1029116_10111608_1349187438162_DSCN2094--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"PI-SWERL\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2012/1029116/1029116_10111608_1349187438162_DSCN2094--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"PI-SWERL\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<...",
