The proposed conference will be held at the Westin Arlington Gateway Hotel, Arlington, VA on 5-7 December 2011. The lead academic chair of the meeting will be John R. Regalbuto of the University of South Carolina. \r\n\r\nThe primary goals for this proposed 3-day conference are to promote dissemination of innovative research progress, to facilitate research partnerships, and to identify future research directions. Oral presentations with question periods, panel discussions, and a poster session are planned as platforms to promote inter-university and academic/industry/government/national-laboratory interactions. These interactions represent a vital step toward the advancement of the goals of the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) (www.nano.gov) which are to: \r\n\r\n1) conduct research and development to realize the full potential of nanoscale science and engineering; \r\n2) develop the skilled workforce and supporting infrastructure needed to advance research and development; \r\n3) better understand the social, ethical, health, and environmental implications of the technology; and, \r\n4) facilitate transfer of the new technologies into commercial products.",
