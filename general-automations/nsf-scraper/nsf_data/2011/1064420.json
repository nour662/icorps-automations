 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraic geometry has a strong and broad representation at the research institutions of the Northeastern states. AGNES is a series of biannual workshops that intends to further the interaction and collaborations between the algebraic geometers in the area. Each workshop is held over a weekend at one of the participating institutions. The workshops include research talks by renowned experts and junior researchers, both from outside the area and within. Professional development sessions and introductory pre-talks are aimed particularly at graduate students. Every workshop culminates with an open problem session. This gives an opportunity to disseminate recent results and developments, and exchange ideas and views about future directions of algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry is the study of spaces defined by polynomial equations. Many of the spaces occurring in nature are of this type, and for this reason algebraic geometry has found diverse applications in the sciences. In particular, there are strong connections with recent work in theoretical physics (string theory). This grant will support a series of algebraic geometry conferences in the Northeastern states. The key aims of the series are to expose graduate students to a broad spectrum of research in the field and to improve communication between the many algebraic geometers in the northeast.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlgebraic geometry is the study of polynomial equations.  It is a\nsubject that has been studied for more than two centuries.  Algebraic\ngeometry started with the Greeks, who were very interested in plane\ngeometry.  They studied lines, circles, ellipses, parabolas and\nhyperbolas.  Thes Greeks realised that there are the only curves you\nget if you slice a cone.  A century and a half later, Newton\ndiscovered that these curves describe the trajectory of the planets;\nthe moon moves in an ellipse around the earth, the earth moves in an\nellipse around the sun and some comets move around in a hyperbolas.\n\nThe modern study of algebraic geometry involves the study of more\ncomplicated curves, surfaces, threefolds and even higher dimensions.\nPolynomial equations are prolific and algebraic geometry has\napplications to physics, chemistry, biology and engineering.\n\nAGNES stands for algebraic geometry, north eastern series.  Twice a\nyear there is a conference held at various universities in the North\nEastern United States.  Over the years, there have been conferences at\nStony Brook, Amherst, UConn, MIT, Brown, Yale and Boston College.\n\nThe weekend of April 1st-3rd, 2011, one of these conferences was held\nat MIT.  The conference was a great success and there were over one\nhundred and fifty participants.  There were seven speakers, four of\nwhom graciously agreed to give half hour introductory talks for the\nbenefit of the junior participants.  All of the talks were recorded\nand are available on the web.  In addition there was a poster session,\nwhere the junior participants presented their work to all of the\nparticipants.  Three of the senior participants were kind enough to\nshare with everyone their vision of the future by presenting\nchallenging open problems.  These problems are available on the web.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/14/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James Mckernan"
