This collection of workshops brings together prominent scholars with promising young economists for discussions of research in progress.  The workshops attract an international audience and provide a way to initiate new research collaborations.   Topics are drawn each year from a list of cutting-edge research areas, interdisciplinary workshops such as Economics and Psychology, and workshops on new methods for data analysis linked to economic theory.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include the contribution to the training of graduate students and young scholars who attend and participate, the workshop website that makes the presented papers available to a broad audience, and the interdisciplinary focus of several of the workshop sessions.  The workshop makes a true contribution to US leadership in this area of science.",
