 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to address student retention and graduation in STEM by providing innovative teaching technologies in introductory mathematics courses, a pre-freshman summer bridge, undergraduate research opportunities, faculty development workshops, and graduate school preparation activities in the STEM academic programs at Elizabeth City State University. This project will emphasize learning with technology, content and pedagogy for inquiry-based learning, and faculty professional development in new media and instructional technology to raise achievement of STEM majors and non-STEM majors in the algebra, pre-calculus and calculus courses. Faculty learning communities will be created to support faculty in developing problem-based learning pedagogies and use of new media and instructional technology, and techniques to integrate successful practices into effective teaching and learning for STEM students. The pre-freshman summer bridge, a STEM freshman seminar course, a special college algebra course for STEM majors, and a STEM learning community through peer-led supplemental instruction are the strategies employed to increase retention of STEM freshman. A mentoring program, a \"Vikings Explorer's Academy\" for sophomores, undergraduate research opportunities, and preparation workshops for graduate school are the strategies employed to address persistence and graduation rates in STEM.",

These changes not only had an impact on the enrollment of STEM Majors but also influenced the retention rates for all of the STEM majors.\n\nObjective 2: Increase the retention rates of the targeted majors by 25% each year of the Project. While ECSU experienced an overall decline of students, VESTEM experienced retention success in different majors through the use of several discipline-based interventions. Overall each of the major disciplines observed a slight increase in the students? overall GPA. Examples of successful interventions include the following:\n\na. Redesign/ develop a college course for STEM majors: The mathematics department revised several of the general education introductory mathematics courses with the inclusion of a new mathematics course specifically targeted to STEM majors.

Because of the success of this intervention, the university launched a partnership with the Education Advisory Board of Washington, D.C. to secure Electronic mentoring software (E4U) to further enhance retention efforts.\n\nd.Viking Explorer Academy exposed STEM majors to a Career Entry Seminar class that provided students with critical thinking strategies, scientific writing and research methodology to include data analysis and basic research techniques.  Through the project, students gained a stronger understanding of basic concepts required for laboratory research that is often inadequate at addressing the student?s utilization of techniques required in a research laboratory environment.  \n\nObjective 3:  Increase Faculty use of technology by 75% by the end of the project. \n\na.
