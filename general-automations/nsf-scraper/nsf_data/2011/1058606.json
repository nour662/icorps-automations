 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a Software-as-a-Service platform to provide Assessment, Discovery, Monitoring, Benchmarking, Comparison, and Promotion of early-stage companies, initially in the information technology and clean energy sectors, in order to provide scalable support with predictable outcomes for entrepreneurs. Guidewire Group is developing the underlying technology platform, assessment methodology, assessment training, automated work plans, curriculum, and portfolio management applications that enable startups and those that work with them to more effectively grow their businesses.\r\n\r\nIf successfully commercialized, the application stands to significantly scale the delivery of business development and advisory resources to early-stage companies and deliver predictable outcomes that improve a company's likelihood of success. By aggregating assessed data on startups worldwide, the application will provide a global context that enables startups to compete more effectively in world markets and to connect more efficiently with a global Innovation Ecosystem that buys and sells services from and to startup companies. Moreover, by delivering the platform in conjunction with a suite of best practices curriculum and a global community of entrepreneurs, the platform will enable organizations that support and incubate startup companies to more effectively manage and map the training of their companies.",

This process, widely known as the Lean Startup Methodology, yielded significant market feedback from startup founders and the organizations that serve them, as well as from corporate interests that desired information about and access to the startup community.  That feedback was the basis of design decisions that drove the feature set for the final release candidate, completed in December 2012.\n\nThe platform, called Guidewire Fusion, is an open data exchange that brings scalability to the startup assessment, mentorship, and acceleration by enabling startups to self-assess their business using the G/Score &trade; methodology, then privately share business information with trusted partners; and by allowing trusted partners to efficiently evaluate and provide feedback to startups.

The most recent Halo Report Q3 2012 from CB Insights, a research organization that tracks private equity, shows a shift in distribution of investment across both market sectors and geographies.  In short, while the startup ecosystem remains complex and fractured, the availability of expert resources to accelerate startups has shifted dramatically in favor of the entrepreneur.  Today there are, for example, some 1,000 accelerator/incubator programs in the U.S. alone.\n\nThis abundance creates a paradox for the Guidewire Group project:  on one hand, easy access to assessment tools, mentors, and business accelerator programs suggests that the scale issue this project aimed to address has been resolved simply by the omnipresence of support resources.  On the other hand, the crowded market suggests an opportunity to aggregate and normalize startup profile data, leverage analytics technologies to evaluate performance and make recommendations, and through open APIs use this data and analytics to fuel a range of applications that could support many actors in the innovation ecosystem: startups, partners, investors, service providers, corporate ventures.  \n\nThrough the course of the project, we expanded our understanding of the concepts of \"mentorship\" and \"acceleration\" to encompass business development activities that delivered targeted opportunities to the startup company.
