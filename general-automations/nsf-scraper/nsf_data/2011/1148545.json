 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many model search strategies involve trading off model fit with model \r\ncomplexity in a penalized goodness of fit measure. Asymptotic properties \r\nfor these types of procedures in some conventional situations, such as \r\nregression and ARMA time series have been studied. Yet, such strategies \r\ndo not always translate into good finite sample performance. Furthermore, \r\nsuch standard model selection procedures encounter difficulties for \r\nnonconventional model selection problems as well. This project aims at \r\ndevelopments of a new model selection strategy, called fence methods, in \r\nfollowing four major areas of methodology research and applications: (i) \r\ndevelopment of adaptive fence methods for high dimensional and complex \r\nmodel selection problems using the idea of restricted maximum likelihood; \r\n(ii) development of data adaptive fence methods for nonparametric model \r\nselection problems such as penalized smoothing spline estimation; (iii) \r\ndevelopment of fence methods for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping; \r\nand (iv) development of user-friendly standalone software for implementing \r\nthe fence methods. \r\n\r\nThe fence idea is generally based on building a statistical fence, or \r\nbarrier, to carefully eliminate incorrect models. This is done by \r\ndetermining which models are within variation of a goodness-of-fit \r\nmeasure of an anchor model. Once the fence is constructed, the optimal \r\nmodel is selected from amongst those within the fence according to \r\na criterion which can be made flexible. For example, the criterion can \r\nincorporate scientific or economic concerns. The adaptive fence method \r\nmay be viewed as comparing signals with noises to come out with an optimal \r\ndecision supported by the data. Given such a wide spectrum of models that \r\ncan be handled, the range of applications seems enormous. Of particular \r\ninterests are applications in human genetics, medical research and surveys. \r\nTo facilitate such translational research, the investigators plan to freely \r\ndisseminate available computer software to implement the fence methods. \r\n \r\n",
