 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continued support for the hadron collider-physics program of the experimental high-energy physics group at Johns Hopkins University, Morris Swartz - PI, for a three-year period. The intellectual merit follows from the new era of discovery and understanding which has and will continue to progress in the field of particle physics. The group will conduct a program of experimental particle physics research primarily within the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The scientific goals of the program are to determine the source of spontaneous symmetry breaking and to significantly constrain models of physics beyond the Standard Model. The proposed research builds on technical innovations and expertise that it has developed over a number of years. The technical innovations will also assist other CMS research that makes use of b-tagging or the reconstruction of highly boosted final states. The broader impact builds on these technical innovations in the area of distributed databases and simulations on the Open Science Grid most notably in the fields of astronomy and the life sciences. In addition, there is a strong educational component through QuarkNet and annual Physics Fairs which especially benefit underrepresented groups in the Baltimore area.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project supported particle physics research that was part of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.  Our group played a key role in CMS\u00c6 discovery of the Higgs boson in the late spring of 2012.  A statistical technique introduced by JHU physicist Andrei Gritsan increased the statistical power of the signal for the Higgs decaying into  \n\ntwo Z bosons which in turn decayed into four leptons.  The increase in statistical power raised the combined significance of the four lepton signal and the two photon signal to the five sigma threshold needed to claim a discovery.  When applied to the final 2012 data sample, the same technique yields a significance of 6.8 sigma for the four lepton sample alone.  The technique was originally developed to determine the intrinsic angular momentum or spin of any Higgs candidates and to learn about a property called parity which describes how the quantum state changes sign under mirror reflections.  The JHU group was at the core of the CMS work on this topic and they have shown that the observed particle has zero angular momentum and positive parity as expected from the Standard Model.  In fact, the Higgs is the first fundamental zero angular momentum particle (not composed of smaller quarks) that has been observed.  The group also applied an indirect technique developed by a pair of JHU theorists to study the width of the Higgs boson.  This quantity is inversely related to the Higgs lifetime and is expected to be too small to be measured by standard techniques.  When the indirect method was applied to CMS data, the width was found to be less than 22 MeV which is consistent with the Standard Model and nearly 150 times better than direct measurements.\n\nThese measurements strongly suggest that the so-called Higgs mechanism is indeed responsible for generating the masses of all of the elementary particles in the Standard Model [the masses of the neutrinos may be more complicated] and certainly have considerable intellectual merit.  \n\nThe JHU group has also been deeply involved in searches for new physical processes beyond those contained in the Standard Model that might account for dark matter or solve some of the mathematical problems remaining in the theory.  This work involves searching for very heavy new particles that decay into much lighter top and bottom quarks and the weak force gauge bosons W and Z.  Because the daughter particles are unstable and are much lighter than the heavy parent particle, they typically decay into collimated jets of the long-lived particles that are actually observed in the CMS detector.  Even though a top quark decays into three daughters of its own, it can appear as a single jet of nearby particles.  This makes it hard to distinguish from a a jet of particles produced a less interesting strong interaction process.  Using another technique developed in part by the JHU theory group, it is possible to examine the substructure of jets to separate those from decaying W/Z bosons or top quarks and those from more common strong interaction processes.  Our group has been at the forefront of this field and has produced some of the world\u00c6s most sensitive searches for new states that decay into top-antitop pairs and gauge boson pairs that are predicted by some extensions of the Standard Model.  The techniques are being refined and will allow searches for heavy states into daughters that contain Higgs jets in future LHC running.  \n\nLike the Higgs work, these measurements and technical developments are advancing our knowledge of how the universe works and have considerable intellectual merit.\n\nThe broader impacts of the project are primarily in education.  It has provided a wide range of training and career development for the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers. Students learn particle physics from working on their thesis topics, attending seminars at Fermilab, CERN and JHU, and interacting with their supervisors.  All of th..."
