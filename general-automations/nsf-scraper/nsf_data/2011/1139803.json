 "awd_abstract_narration": "California State University (CSU) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation\r\n(CSU-LSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program (cohort 9) is a collaborative effort between\r\nthe National Science Foundation and California State University institutions to increase\r\nthe quality and quantity of underrepresented minorities matriculating to completion of\r\nthe doctoral degree in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields (STEM)\r\nfields. The program at California State University, Northridge prepares students to meet\r\nthe challenges of completing doctoral programs of study and for academic careers in\r\nhigher education. In addition, the program develops leadership skills necessary for\r\nsuccess in the STEM workforce nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\nIntegrating research and education, the BD fellows are nurtured over two years as a\r\ncohort community that benefits from a program of academic and personal\r\ndevelopment activities as well as social support to sustain their commitment and\r\nsuccess to the terminal Ph.D. STEM degree. Program activities include linkages with\r\nGraduate Education in the Professoriate (AGEP) institutions and other graduate\r\neducation programs to advance students in Ph.D. programs.\r\n\r\nTwelve students from underrepresented minority populations in STEM fields will\r\nparticipate in the program at California State University, Northridge during the\r\n2011-2013 academic years. Results from this support broadens the participation of\r\nAfrican-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Pacific-Islanders in the STEM\r\npipeline globally. Results from rigorous evaluation of the project adds to the body of\r\nliterature in the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority students in\r\nSTEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe project anticipates that at least 95% of the new participants will complete Master's\r\ndegrees, and that at least 90% of these students will earn STEM doctorate degrees.\r\nThis project not only targets a student population that might not otherwise pursue\r\ndoctoral level training, but also makes a special effort to target STEM disciplines that\r\nhave relatively low overall doctorate degree production and the lowest shares of URM\r\nstudents. In these disciplines (specifically, geological sciences, physics and astronomy,\r\nmathematics, engineering, and computer science), small increases in the number of\r\ndoctorates awarded to URM students will have a significant impact on discipline\r\ndemographics.\r\n\r\nBD project activities include a variety of valued \"best practices\" for supporting and\r\nadvancing LSAMP students. Specifically, the project provides the following:\r\n- rigorous Master?s-level course-work\r\n- a two-year research experience with the guidance of a faculty mentor;\r\n- professional development workshops and activities, including participation in scientific\r\nconferences;\r\n- monthly meetings to monitor student progress,\r\n- networking with other BD Fellows in doctoral programs, and\r\n- provide assistance with graduate school and fellowship applications.",

California State University, Northridge (CSUN) one of the 22 California State University campuses in CSU-LSAMP served as the \"graduate institutional site\" for this BD Activity.  The specific goal of the project is to broaden participation in STEM at the doctoral level by providing a Masters level \"bridge\" to doctoral studies for a cohort of 12 new Masters students recruited from the national pool of baccalaureate recipients from LSAMP programs.  Since the pool of LSAMP baccalaureate recipients includes a high proportion of talented individuals from racial/ethnic groups that are underrepresented in STEM, this project aims to bring this talent and diversity to academe and science research.  Overall, this project\u00c6s expected outcome is that no fewer than 8 of the 12 students who participate in the project will complete STEM doctoral degrees. While this number may seem small, the project targets a student population that might not otherwise pursue doctoral training and also targets STEM disciplines that have relatively low overall doctoral degree production and the lowest \"shares\" of students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups. In these disciplines (e.g., geoscience, physics, computer science; 3% of all doctorates earned), small increases in the number of doctorates awarded to students from URM groups will have a significant impact on discipline demographics.\n\nProject Activities: Project activities included a variety of valued \"best practices\" for supporting and advancing LSAMP students toward completion of doctoral level studies in STEM.  Specifically, project support/activities include: (1) substantial financial support for the initial two years of Masters-level study; (2) rigorous graduate-level course-work; (3) a two-year research experience; (4) professional development activities (e.g., workshops, seminars, conference participation); (5) monthly meetings to monitor student progress; (6) \"connecting\" Fellows to doctoral programs through collaborations with faculty and programs at Ph.D. institutions; (7) assistance with applications to Ph.D. programs, financial aid and fellowship programs; and (8) leveraging linkages with Ph.D. programs to encourage program interest in admission of CSU-LSAMP BD Fellows into Ph.D. programs.\n\nOutcomes: CSU-LSAMP continues to find that the BD model it has developed is an effective strategy for advancing the goal of broadening participation in STEM doctoral-level study. This model, which provides financial, academic and professional development support at the Masters level, has proven successful in recruiting, retaining, and advancing talented minority students who, otherwise, would be unlikely to pursue doctoral level study.\n\nThe project was successful in attracting a full cohort of twelve (12) talented graduates of LSAMP undergraduate programs to the CSU-LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate Activity at CSUN.
