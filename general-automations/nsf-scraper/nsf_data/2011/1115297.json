 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sparse direct methods form the backbone of many applications in\r\ncomputational science, but the methods are not keeping pace with advances\r\nin heterogeneous computing architectures.  High end systems can be built to\r\ncontain multiple general-purpose CPU cores, coupled with one or more\r\nGraphics Processing Units (GPUs) each with hundreds of simple yet fast\r\ncomputational cores.  This project develops high-performance parallel\r\nsparse direct methods that can exploit GPU-based architectures to achieve\r\norders of magnitude gains in computational performance.  The focus is\r\nsingle and multiple GPU algorithms for multifrontal sparse QR\r\nfactorization.  QR factorization has wide applicability, is numerically\r\nvery stable and is useful in many application areas.  The nonuniform and\r\nhierarchical structure of sparse QR factorization along with the unique\r\nfeatures of the GPU  requires the development of novel algorithms.\r\nThese include managing the simultaneous mix of regular computations inside\r\nthe frontal matrix, and irregular computations in the assembly process\r\nbetween nodes in the computational tree and between concurrent subtrees.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn efficient sparse QR factorization is an essential kernel in many\r\nproblems in computational science.  It can be used to find solutions to\r\nsparse linear systems, sparse linear least squares problems, eigenvalue\r\nproblems, rank and null-space determination, and many other mathematical\r\nproblems in numerical linear algebra.  Application areas that can exploit\r\nthe result of this research include structural engineering, computational\r\nfluid dynamics, electromagnetics, semiconductor devices, thermodynamics,\r\nmaterials, acoustics, computer graphics/vision, robotics/kinematics,\r\noptimization, circuit simulation, economic and financial modeling, chemical\r\nprocess simulation, text/document networks, and many other areas.  QR\r\nfactorization is representative of many other sparse direct methods, with\r\nboth irregular coarse-grain parallelism and regular fine-grain parallelism,\r\nand methodologies developed are very relevant for these other\r\nmethods.  The work has broad impact on computational linear\r\nalgebra, optimization, and related application areas.  The PI's research extends beyond these specific applications of numerical linear algebra, demonstrating how problems with a mixture of irregular and regular computation can be performed on the challenging yet promising landscape of GPU computing, and opens the door to many other kinds of applications.  The investigator and his colleagues plan on producing and distributing high-quality software as a result of this work, for which they have a 20-year track record.",
