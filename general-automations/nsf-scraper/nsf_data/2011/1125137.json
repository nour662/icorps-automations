 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Cynthia M. Friend of Harvard University is supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to chair a workshop on defining critical directions for the future of chemical catalysis.  The workshop will be co-chaired with Dr. Hector D. Abruna of Cornell University and Dr. Melanie S. Sanford of the University of Michigan.  The workshop will draw together a diverse group of established and emerging leaders in catalysis in order to articulate the grand challenges and future directions in this area of research.  The workshop will address the role of catalysis in advancing the national need for sustainability.  Chemical catalysis plays a central role in energy, such as in the production of renewable fuels, manufacturing, such as in the synthesis of chemical, pharmaceuticals and materials, and environmental sustainability, such as in carbon dioxide conversion, pollution control and remediation.    The workshop proceedings and conclusions will be disseminated to the scientific community through a website and a workshop report.",
