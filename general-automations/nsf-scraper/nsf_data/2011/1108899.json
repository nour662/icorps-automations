 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to advance understandings of teacher professional knowledge in science.  It focuses on bringing greater clarity to the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) construct, the model of professional knowledge in which PCK is embedded, and its implications for enhancing teacher practice and student learning. \r\n\r\nThirty participants from eight countries will take on the task of contributing to and/or completing this synthesis through a summit and follow-up activities. A set of recommendations will be made to guide future research aimed at advancing this field of study.\r\n\r\nThis is a very worthy project in science education research. It is innovative and brings together world-wide experts in science education to develop products that will communicate refined models for teacher professional knowledge. The project draws on past NSF-supported research and builds on a highly diverse body of literature.  It yields a wealth of information that could lead to a commonly accepted agreement among science education researchers about PCK and articulates future directions for collaborative research as well as instrument development and/or refinement.",

PCK is thought to be a critical type of knowledge that teachers have that makes them effective as teachers.  From 20-26 October 2012 we hosted the PCK Summit in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA with the explicit purpose of having leading researchers in this field of study address the considerable divergences in the interpretation and understanding of PCK and clarify distinctions between different, viable models of PCK. The Summit participants came from seven different countries and all had a history of studying PCK within science education and a willingness to consider whether or not it was possible to agree to a consensus model for studying PCK.\n\nAs a result of the Summit, we developed a shared definition of PCK, a consensus model for studying PCK, and a number of products, most of which are available at pcksummit.bscs.org\n\nThe shared definition has two parts:\n\nPersonal PCK is the knowledge of, reasoning behind, and planning for teaching a particular topic in a particular way for a particular purpose to particular students for enhanced student outcomes (Reflection on Action, Explicit)\nPersonal PCK and skill is the act of teaching a particular topic in a particular way for a particular purpose to particular students for enhanced student outcomes (Reflection in Action, tacit or explicit)\n\n\nThe consensus model is presented in Image 1.

The book is titled Re-Examining Pedagogical Content Knowledge, is edited by Amanda Berry, Pat Friedrichsen &amp; John Loughran, and includes 15 invited chapters about the study of PCK.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Janet Carlson"
