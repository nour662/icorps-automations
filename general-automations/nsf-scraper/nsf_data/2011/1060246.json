 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is an engineering scholarship program (ESP Scholars) to increase the access and diversity in the engineering and engineering technology fields.  It will provide scholarships to at least 75 talented and financially needy students with at least 50% from underrepresented groups (minorities and women).  The project will increase the retention of ESP Scholars and enhance placement of graduating ESP students in the STEM workforce or enrollment in a four-year engineering degree program by improving student academic and support services.  The scholarship program supports the development of student intellectual capacity. It incorporates best practices for retention of underrepresented students and provides continuing opportunities for students to build a cohort and explore common academic and social interests throughout their college experience. The project team will study similarities and differences between ESP students and non-ESP students.  The broader impact of the project will be demonstrated by an increase in the number of students from underrepresented groups who major in engineering disciplines and receive associate degrees. Students will be supported by a diverse team of faculty, staff and industry representatives. The project will also demonstrate that stronger connections between two and four-year colleges will help diversify the pool of engineers.",
