 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grassland plant communities along the Colorado Front Range are responding to directional changes in climate, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, increased nitrogen deposition, and invasion by many non-native plant species introduced by humans over the last century. A warmer climate and relatively wetter non-growing season appear to support a new group of plant species adapted to the new conditions. These species may also be affecting the ecological role of an important plant consumer known to have very large impacts on the biological diversity of grasslands. Prairie dogs, animals whose presence is critical to the presence of many other species, are believed to interact with invasive plants such that plant community dynamics are dramatically altered from what they were under historical reference conditions. This study will measure how the new plant species are exploiting climate and resource changes, document how grazing activities by prairie dogs are influenced by these species, and assess the effects of the interactions on plant species change and soil erosion.\r\n \r\nThis research is important because it tests the hypothesis that directional changes in climate and concurrent changes in plant species can alter the role that an animal has in maintaining the structure and function of grassland communities. This project will train undergraduate students, graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher in environmental change ecology, and will provide the subject material for a senior-graduate course in scenario planning for natural areas in an era of rapid environmental change. The researchers will use this study to engage K-12 students, teachers, stakeholders and managers in searching for solutions to conservation problems.",

The interactions amongst these change agents is likely creating a novel ecosystem. We explored the patterns and mechanisms of change.\n\nOur study measured four related hypotheses.  Hypothesis 1: An expanded growing season and wetter winters have created a new and largely unoccupied niche that has been filled by a combination of native and non-native winter annual plants.  However, as a consequence of Hypothesis 1, Hypothesis 2: The success of the winter annuals produces a cascading effect on plant communities.

The success of winter annuals, in conjunction with the abundance of other, non-native cool season (C3) plants, was argued to alter prairie dog behavior in a way that produces late winter dust storms and further vegetation changes.  Specifically, Hypothesis 4:  Non-native invasive plant species allow prairie dogs to remain actively grazing areas that otherwise could not support prairie dogs. Such areas are subsequently denuded of vegetation (including litter cover), and are vulnerable to desertification.  Among the drivers of this is that the winter annual, cheatgrass is a preferred winter forage species for prairie dogs, and that the toxic, introduce plant, bindweed, is detoxified when it senesces and becomes a preferred food item, thereby keeping prairie dogs from foraging elsewhere.  The outcome is the erosion of surface soils on prairie dog colonies.\n\nAll of our hypotheses have been tested and supported.  Through a series of  five publications and two reports under review, we demonstrate that winter wet systems can favor introduced winter annual species, including cheatgrass, and that these increases are at least at the partial expense of more desirable (from both an economic and conservation perspective) prairie species.  We also exploited a natural experiment, a record extreme precipitation event, to further test our questions.\n\nThe findings on the prairie dogs, currently summarized in two publications, with three more in the final stages of preparation, is of societal concern for multiple reasons.  First, the animal itself is a subject of conservation actions.  However, at the urban interface, a \u00e6perfect storm\u00c6 of ecological interactions appears to occur, thereby altering the classical \u00e6keystone species\u00c6 label often identified for this animal.  First, densities of the animals are higher than under more natural conditions.  However, even when the animals have room to move their colonies, they appear slow to do so.  We demonstrated that presence of prairie dogs actually significantly reduces the abundance of cheatgrass, arguably a good thing.  However, the animal preferentially consumes all grass species, and the community of surviving plants is dominated by a toxic morning-glory species, bindweed.  This species serves as winter forage, and prairie dog colony areas are denuded of vegetation at that time. The lack of a permanent snow-cover in the Boulder area (exacerbated by naturally occurring high winds), results in substantial surface erosion.  We conclude that such..."
