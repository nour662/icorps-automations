 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Conner Museum of Natural History at Washington State University consists of nearly 73,000 vertebrate specimens that are used for research, teaching, and public outreach.  This project will alleviate collection storage restrictions and accomplish curation needs.  The Museum?s specimen cases are full, which prevents (1) the addition of new collections and (2) the archival storage of approximately 16,400 prepared specimens held currently in temporary storage.  Additionally, approximately 500 specimens kept currently in frozen storage require curation and incorporation in archival storage. These concerns will be resolved by adding sixty new archival quality cases for specimen storage and the curation of frozen specimens. Ultra cold freezers will be added for storage of tissues for molecular studies.  Data for all specimens added to the collection will be served on the Internet.\r\n\r\nThis project will result primarily in (1) better storage of specimens to promote their long-term preservation and diverse use, (2) greater accessibility of specimens and collection data to researchers, students, and the public, and (3) opportunities for future growth of the Museum.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained to prepare and curate specimens and manage museum data.  A weblog aimed at the public will follow project progress and explain associated ideas.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project aimed to make infrastructural changes and support curation and computerization of specimens.  The primary objectives and the main outcomes related to each objective were the following:\n\n \n\nObjective 1&mdash;Adding 60 new specimen cases:  During the first year of the project, we shifted the use of physical spaces in the museum to open sufficient space for more specimen cases.  Sixty new cases were purchased and added to the existing cases in the main collection.  We also purchased drawers for the cases and archival trays for holding diverse specimens.\n\n \n\nObjective 2&mdash;Expanding specimen storage from tightly packed existing cases into new cases:   This goal has been completed, and specimens are spread throughout the old and new cases.  Notably, the addition of the new cases has created opportunity for new growth in the museum.\n\n \n\nObjective 3&mdash;Curating the Hallett collection: All 16,400 specimens in the Hallet collection from ecosystem studies in the Pacific Northwest have been accessioned and incorporated in cases in the main collection.  All available records for these specimens have been computerized, and they are served to the community through VertNet.  \n\n \n\nObjective 4&mdash;Backlogged specimens:  All of the backlogged specimens have been curated and accessioned in the collection.  During the project we prepared 585 backlogged specimens, including 347 mammals and 238 birds, exceeding the number we had proposed originally.  All records for these specimens have been computerized, and they are available to the community through VertNet.\n\n \n\nObjective 5&mdash;Installing two -80 freezers to archive tissues samples:  Two new ultracold freezers were added to the museum during year two of the project.  The tissue collection has been curated, and we have been making tissue collections and accessioning them along with skin and skeletal materials of new specimens.  These tissue collections will create new opportunities for future biochemical and molecular study of collections in the museum.\n\n \n\nIn addition to those primary objectives, other important outcomes were the following:\n\n1.  Six graduate students, four undergraduate students, and four non-student assistants received training during the project in various aspects of museum operations, including cataloging specimens, computerization of specimens, and curation. Thus, the project served to develop skills in students and other assistants that would otherwise not have had an opportunity to gain skills in museum operations.\n\n \n\n2. Through development of the Conner Museum of Natural History, the project made an important contribution to infrastructure at Washington State University.  Notably, the improvements to specimen storage provide better access to the specimens in secure, museum-quality cases with reduced likelihood of damage associated with tight packing.\n\n \n\n3.  This project has contributed generally to opportunities for the study of biodiversity by adding new specimens and specimen data that can be used by researchers and others.  Some of the specimen data are connected to ecosystem projects that may have important value as the dynamics of ecosystems in the inland Pacific Northwest continue to shift with the fragmentation of \u00e6natural environments\u00c6 and rapid climate change.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Larry D Hufford"
