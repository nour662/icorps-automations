 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award will implement a new paradigm for interdisciplinary training of Ph.D. students in the application of neutron scattering research within three major themes of condensed matter science. Intellectual Merit: These themes include: 1) biological macromolecules and biomaterials; 2) the structure and dynamics of strongly correlated electronic materials; and 3) design of artificial nanoscale materials. Fundamental research utilizing neutron scattering techniques has led to a host of technological advances in such diverse areas as drug design, the development of high-strength metals and cements, novel materials for electronic and magnetic devices, and hydrogen storage materials.  Based on these achievements in science and engineering, recent progress in the design of neutron scattering instrumentation, and the potential for new discoveries, the United States has invested nearly $2B in new facilities for neutron scattering over the past decade. The proposed graduate curriculum will exploit a combined problem-based learning/writing intensive approach accessible to students from traditionally distinct disciplines. It will combine in-depth, hands-on training at our university-based neutron sources with innovative theoretical courses encompassing the three major research themes. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will enlarge the community of researchers capable of exploiting new neutron scattering facilities of unprecedented power just as they are coming online. The trainees will develop communication and organizational skills required for geographically dispersed teams to utilize these national facilities effectively. In addition to training leaders for future interdisciplinary university-based research, the project will provide a pool of potential users and employees of both national research facilities and highly competitive industries that depend on complex materials.  The interdisciplinary curriculum is designed to attract future scientists from fields outside of physics and students from underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nIGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.",

neutron scattering experiments include:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;?<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Biomaterials</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;A team at NCSU/ORNL applied neutron scattering to determine the crystal structure of enzymes used to degrade cellulose to form biofuels such as ethanol.&nbsp;They gained new insight at the atomic level into the mechanism of cellulose degradation that could lead to improved methods for the industrial production of biofuels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Engineering instrumentation</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;With the digital age comes an urgent need to develop more effective ways of cooling electronic instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;A team at MU investigated how the performance of devices called Oscillating Heat Pipes (OHP) could be enhanced to cool devices such as laptop computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;They used neutron scattering to show how a copper-oxide coating of an OHP affects the motion of water molecules in it, allowing better heat conduction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Materials for renewable energy</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Lithium batteries are increasingly used in autos and a variety of electronic devices.&nbsp;A team at ORNL and the Missouri University of Science and Technology used neutron scattering to study the composition and structure of a chemical layer that forms on the electrodes of lithium batteries during their operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their findings could lead to improved battery design.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In the course of our IGERT project, 15 trainees received their Ph.D. degree.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our IGERT alumni are already pursuing careers in which they are using their training in neutron scattering techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two IGERT alumni were awarded prestigious National Research Council Fellowships to conduct research utilizing neutron scattering.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other trainees conducted postdoctoral research at ORNL where one now holds a permanent staff position.&nbsp;&nbsp;One alumnus is employed at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three trainees currently hold 2-year internships at ORNL.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several more trainees are on track to receive their Ph.D. degree within two years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;We summarize with a quote from our External Evaluation:&nbsp;&nbsp;?The Neutron Scattering IGERT is an exemplary model of interdisciplinary graduate training in neutron scattering science.&nbsp;&nbsp;The project combines interdisciplinary collaboration between biochemistry, physics, chemistry, and engineering with an innovative curriculum, strong ties to national labs, and access to the MU research reactor.&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique program provides national benefit by training future scientists in this critically important area.?</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/14/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Haskell&nbsp;Taub</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1069091/1069091_10128668_1543511619167_NSschematic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1069091/1069091_10128668_1543511619167_NSschematic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Schematic of Neutron Scattering\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1069091/1069091_10128668_1543511619167_NSschematic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Schematic of Neutron Scattering\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A typical neutron scattering experiment: when a beam of neutrons from either a reactor or spallation source strikes a sample of interest, it scatters in an outgoing beam that strikes a detector.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFundamental research utilizing neutron scattering techniques has led to a host of technological advancesin such diverse areas as drug design, the development of high-strength metals and cements, novelmaterials for electronic and magnetic devices, and hydrogen storage materials.  Spurred by theseachievements in science and engineering and the potential for new discoveries, the United States has invested over $2B in newresearch facilities for neutron scattering over the past two decades.  Our nation?s expanded commitment to neutron scattering has provided exciting newopportunities for research in areas as diverse as biology, chemistry, materialsscience, condensed matter physics, and mechanical engineering.\n\n To maximize the scientific impact of these new capabilities for neutron scattering research requires innovative methods of training the next generation of scientists and engineers.  Our IGERT project met this challenge by developing a new paradigm for interdisciplinary training of Ph.D. students in the application of neutron scattering techniques within three major interdisciplinary research themes: 1) biological macromolecules and biomaterials; 2) engineering applications and related materials; and 3) materials related to renewable energy sources.\n\n Our plan coordinated the use of two complementary university-based neutron sources:  the research reactor at the University of Missouri (MU) and the Low Energy Neutron Source at Indiana University (IU).  The research reactor at MU has the highest power (10 MW) at a U.S. university, while IU has the only campus-based accelerator-driven pulsed neutron source.  Thus, our institutions offer unique training facilities in neutron scattering techniques combined with substantial educational opportunities.  Through partnering with Fisk University, an HBCU, and North Carolina State University (NCSU), we set as one of our highest priorities the recruitment of students from groups underrepresented in neutron scattering science.\n\n At MU, we created a core curriculum for our IGERT project and used it to train a total of 27 graduate students to become sophisticated users of our nation?s neutron scattering facilities.  Our core curriculum included three problem-based, writing-intensive graduate courses as well as frequent use of our neutron sources at MU and IU.  Each of our core courses included more writing than usually required in graduate-level courses?at least three reports that were critiqued by scientists expert in the topics.\n\n We enhanced research and training at our unique on-campus neutron scattering facilities by research experiences at the world?s most powerful neutron source, the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and the recently expanded Center for Neutron Research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  Our trainees wrote proposals and were awarded beam time for experiments at these premier international centers and also attended two week-long workshops on state-of-the-art neutron scattering techniques hosted by ORNL.\n\n Research highlights from our IGERT project based on our trainees? neutron scattering experiments include:\n\n ?Biomaterials:  A team at NCSU/ORNL applied neutron scattering to determine the crystal structure of enzymes used to degrade cellulose to form biofuels such as ethanol. They gained new insight at the atomic level into the mechanism of cellulose degradation that could lead to improved methods for the industrial production of biofuels.\n\n Engineering instrumentation:  With the digital age comes an urgent need to develop more effective ways of cooling electronic instruments.  A team at MU investigated how the performance of devices called Oscillating Heat Pipes (OHP) could be enhanced to cool devices such as laptop computers.  They used neutron scattering to show how a copper-oxide coating of an OHP affects the motion of water molecules in it, allowing better heat conduction.\n\n Materials for renewable energy:  Lithium batteries are increasingly used in autos and a variety of electronic devices. A team at ORNL and the Missouri University of Science and Technology used neutron scattering to study the composition and structure of a chemical layer that forms on the electrodes of lithium batteries during their operation.  Their findings could lead to improved battery design.\n\n In the course of our IGERT project, 15 trainees received their Ph.D. degree.  Some of our IGERT alumni are already pursuing careers in which they are using their training in neutron scattering techniques.  Two IGERT alumni were awarded prestigious National Research Council Fellowships to conduct research utilizing neutron scattering.  Two other trainees conducted postdoctoral research at ORNL where one now holds a permanent staff position.  One alumnus is employed at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.  Three trainees currently hold 2-year internships at ORNL.  Several more trainees are on track to receive their Ph.D. degree within two years.\n\n We summarize with a quote from our External Evaluation:  ?The Neutron Scattering IGERT is an exemplary model of interdisciplinary graduate training in neutron scattering science.  The project combines interdisciplinary collaboration between biochemistry, physics, chemistry, and engineering with an innovative curriculum, strong ties to national labs, and access to the MU research reactor.  The unique program provides national benefit by training future scientists in this critically important area.?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Haskell Taub"
