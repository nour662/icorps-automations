The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThese funds were used to purchase an equipment package for enhancing the Langseth\u00c6s Mammal Mitigation program.\n\n This equipment package includes a small sound source that can be used to maintain environmental compliance during seismic operations when our larger sound source is turned off.  The Langseth\u00c6s standard multiple sound source arrays operate using two large Ariel seismic compressors driven by two Caterpiller engines that generate continuous air pressure at 2000psi.  This smaller package requires only 100psi and can run off the ship\u00c6s standard air compressor.\n\n Our mammal mitigation measures require that vessel maintain at least one active source during periods of maintenance, line changes, or other factors.  Currently, this requires keeping our large seismic compressors working all the time to maintain air pressure in the system and operate just a portion of the larger array.  Howver, this new package is small, relatively lightweight, and easy to deploy.  When deployed in the water, this small sound source will allow the vessel to remain in compliance with permitted decibel requirements while allowing shut down of the large air compressors supplying the normal 2000-psi.  This reduces runtime for our heavy equipment, decreases our energy usage and costs, and makes maintenance of our source array easier to accomplish. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/15/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sean M Higgins"
