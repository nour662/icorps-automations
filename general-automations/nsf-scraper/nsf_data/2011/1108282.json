Genes are the ingredients of a cell, describing which proteins will eventually be synthesized by the cell and subsequently used in cellular processes.

It is possible to either lose or gain copies of genes. This occurs when regions of the genome, in particular different parts of chromosomes, are amplified or removed. Chromosomes are the physical organizing centers of the genome.
