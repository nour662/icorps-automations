 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project will provide fundamental understanding of how local stress concentrations and formation of damage during curing are related to the weave architecture and fabrication parameters of three-dimensional woven composites. Comprehensive numerical modeling tools to predict microcracking during matrix cure and under service conditions will be developed and validated by experiments. Experimental studies will be performed on the specimens specifically fabricated in industrial setting to support the modeling effort and gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of resin pocket cracking. They will include microstructure characterization using optical and SEM microscopy, microcomputed tomography, traditional mechanical testing, residual stress determination by material removal, and multiaxial stress tests on neat resin. Guidelines for safe design of three-dimensional woven composites will be proposed. \r\n\r\nAdvances in understanding and modeling of microcracking in 3D woven composites during resin curing will lead to improvements in technology of manufacturing and ?tailoring? of these materials for various applications. Demonstrating that they can be produced free of microcracks with inexpensive resins will greatly expand their utilization in aerospace, automotive, ground transportation, wind energy, and recreational marine industries. The work will be conducted in close collaboration between the University of New Hampshire and Albany Engineered Composites, Inc., and will be disseminated through journal publications, conference presentations and two industrial workshops.",

The resulting models of unit cells (the repeating weave patterns for each architecture, as shown in Figure 2) were used to predict the overall composite material properties and evaluate the residual stresses in the composites subjected to a 140oC cooling from the curing to room temperature.  Three different failure criteria for the resin were investigated, and it was observed that the parabolic stress criterion best predicts the location of the process induced micro-cracks, see Figure 3.\n\nA unique dilatometric method was created to measure the failure stress of the resin under hydrostatic tension during cooling from the curing temperature.  The method creates the hydrostatic tensile stress by curing the resin in a low coefficient of thermal expansion, capped tube and cooling it.  The stress in the resin is inferred from the displacement of the outer wall of the tube using plane strain pressure vessel formulas. The hydrostatic tensile stress is observed to linearly increase on cooling until a discontinuity is observed that is defined as failure.  Figure 4 shows that thehydrostatic failure stress increased linearly with cooling from the curing temperature until it reached a limiting value of ~28 MPa.  Figure 5 shows the hydrostatic stress vs. temperature for a three step curing schedule proposed by the PIs.  The modified schedule reduced the zero stress temperature by ~30&deg;C which significantly reduces the residual stresses in the resin and ultimately in the composite.\n\nOver the duration of the project, six graduate students from UNH, three international students from France, and two undergraduate students have participated in the research activities and interaction with industrial collaborators.
