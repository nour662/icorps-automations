 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Grambling State University HBCU-UP project, Center for Mathematical Achievement in Science & Technology II (CMAST II), is designed to improve student performance and increase the success rate of STEM undergraduates by infusing problem based and inquiry learning pedagogies in introductory sciences and technology courses, expanding a Scholars' program with academic coaching, restructuring a summer science program for high school students, and implementing a science and mathematics teacher certification program.\r\n\r\nA primary focus of this project is student retention in STEM majors with an approach to increase student retention in STEM introductory courses. These courses will be redesigned to include problem based learning which has been found to improve student learning outcomes and success. Problem based pedagogies have been piloted with promising results in selected sections of introductory courses in Engineering Technology, Computer Science, and Chemistry (using POGIL-Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning), and this project will infuse these pedagogies in the first and second sequence of courses in these subject areas and Physics. Faculty development workshops will be provided to faculty to assist them in implementing these teaching strategies in problem based learning and inquiry. The project will use the STEM First Year Learning Community as an intervention also to support academic success and increase student retention in STEM. A Rising Sophomore Summer Academy will be a three week research training experience to prepare and increase skills and participation of students in research experiences for undergraduates.A STEM Teacher Education Certification program will be developed for biology, physics, and mathematics majors to get teacher certified along with attaining their STEM degree and the project expects to increase the institution's production of STEM teachers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGrambling State University implemented the Center for Mathematical Achievement in Science &amp; Technology (CMAST II) Project.  This project had an overall objective of impacting the STEM workforce pipeline by graduating highly prepared science and technology (STEM) students with Bachelor of Science degrees. The Intellectual Merit of CMAST II involved the design of activities that, when implemented, would support a major goal of increasing the ability of students to be successful in acquiring specific STEM competencies.  These competencies support success in the workforce and success in educational programs at the graduate level.  This goal was achieved by sponsoring activities that enhanced the student's academic experience.  These activities included Redesigning Introductory STEM Courses to engage students in hands- on-projects that required the use of critical thinking skills.   Another activity implemented was a STEM Learning Community that supported increasing the success of freshman students and their retention to the second year of college as a STEM major.   This learning community linked students with an Academic Coach.   This Coach was responsible for ensuring that freshman students adjusted to the freedoms associated with being on a college campus, while remaining focused on mastering student learning outcomes linked to the academic program.  To enhance the research skills of students, a Rising Sophomore Academy was established for students who had completed their freshman year.   Students in the Academy had the opportunity to complete mini-research projects and to acquire laboratory skills.  In an effort to recruit high school students into STEM degree programs at Grambling State University, CMAST II implemented an activity that created a pipeline.  CMAST II partnered with the University to offer a Summer High Ability program that was open to high school students who had completed their junior year.   High School Students in this program had the opportunity to earn six hours of college credit and the opportunity to complete a STEM related research project.\n\nCMAST II was successful in recruiting, retaining, and graduating STEM students.  Highlighted below are examples of the impact that the CMAST II Project had on graduating highly prepared STEM students at Grambling State University.\n\nMore than two hundred (200) students participated in the STEM Learning Community.\n One hundred forty (140) high school students participated in the High Ability Summer Program.
