 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches:\r\nThe objective of this research is to design flexible, multilayered polymer film power generators that convert cardiac motion into electrical power to recharge automatic implantable cardiac defibrillators and bi-ventricular pacemakers. The approach is to engineer the film thickness, crystalline and surface energy states, towards orders-of-magnitude enhancement in  power output. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  \r\nWhile longevity of average congestive heart failure patients has increased to 15 years after implantation, batteries for the cardiac defibrillators and pacemaker are replaced every 4-5 years. This mismatch poses significant clinical and economic burden. Our hypothesis is that flexible, conformable poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) films containing many nanolayers (each 10-100 nm thick) can be embedded inside the current intra-cardiac leads to convert cardiac mechanical motion into electrical energy by exploiting the piezoelectricity of PVDF. The research tasks include designing a power generator made of PVDF films, characterization and optimization of energy generation, and determination of mechano-electrical coupling efficiencies. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis research paves the way towards the creation of robust, scalable, energy-relevant nanomaterials and implantable microsystems that capitalize upon with the extraordinary efficiency of the hearts contraction and relaxation. The findings will enable development of broad classes of tunable nanomaterials to tailor energy conversion characteristics with potential applications in energy efficient biochips. This project will be conducted at UT Austin and UT Health Science Center. Life scientists, engineering researchers, graduate and undergraduate students at both campuses will be trained in three key emerging areas of biomedical engineering, including biomedical microelectromechanical systems, nanomaterials and interventional cardiology.",
