 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work is a collaborative effort between Towson University and the industrial partner Triton Services Inc. towards developing uncooled microbolometer arrays based on thin films of hole-doped rare earth perovskite manganite materials. Epitaxial manganite thin films will be developed on Silicon, employing lattice engineering schemes, and the properties of these films will be optimized for bolometer operation at or close to room temperature. Single test bolometers and microbolometer arrays will be fabricated and device performance will be evaluated. \r\nIntellectual merit: Manganite materials hold potential for superior performance in terms of sensitivity, stability and robustness compared to other bolometer materials currently employed for uncooled IR imaging. Successful demonstration and evaluation of manganite microbolometer arrays will lead to the assimilation of this technology by the IR imaging industry. The proposed effort will generate a knowledge base related to materials manipulation, silicon-integration and device fabrication, which will be useful for other technological applications of the manganites. The materials physics involved in the hetero-epitaxial lattice engineering will contribute to the understanding of oxide hetero-structures and interfaces.\r\nBroader Impacts: the proposed effort will enhance the educational experience of the students at Towson University through the industry-university interaction.  Graduate students of the recently started professional science masters program will be involved in the proposed work. The industry-university collaboration and student involvement in applied research will serve as a model for other professional science masters programs. Content related to the proposed project will also be incorporated in K-12 STEM outreach activities at Towson University.",
