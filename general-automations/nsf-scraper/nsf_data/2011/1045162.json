 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transit time of groundwater, from recharge at the water table to discharge at streams, is a fundamental aquifer characteristic relevant to rates of contaminant transport in groundwater and other aspects of water resource management.  The project goal is a rigorous quantitative comparison of three novel approaches for estimating each of three variables related to transit time and non-point-source nitrate contamination:  (a) the mean transit time (MTT) of groundwater in aquifers, (b) the magnitude of water and nitrate flux from aquifers to streams, and (c) the amount of nitrate degradation occurring in groundwater prior to seepage into streams.  Each of the three approaches is based on groundwater and stream hydrologic and tracer measurements, however, the data collection methods and analysis strategies differ greatly. A side-by-side evaluation of the approaches elucidating strengths and limitations does not exist and will be completed by this project in two streams in an agricultural region of the N.C. Coastal Plain.\r\n\r\nThe project will take place in the Neuse River watershed, site of an ambitious basin-wide regulatory effort by the state of N.C. to reduce nitrogen (N) contamination and associated harmful algal blooms and fish kills in the Neuse River estuary.  Several years of effort have not reduced estuarine N input. Groundwater transit times for N, which can extend for decades, are potentially an important contributing factor.  By comparing three novel approaches to measuring MTT, nitrate flux, and nitrate degradation, this project will better define the pros and cons of the approaches.  The results will provide practical guidance to improve assessment strategies applicable to water resource and land management.  The project will provide advanced hydrologic training for students at two universities (N.C. State and the Univ. of Utah), and practical results and insight for state regulators dealing with non-point-source pollutants.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, we found that new and innovative methods of sampling groundwater discharge in and on streambeds can quantify the rate at which non-point-source nitrate pollution moves from aquifers to streams, and provide insights on the timing of that movement and why different methods might give different results.  Sampling at numerous individual points deep in the streambed showed how much nitrate is coming up out of the aquifer to the stream, but lower rates of nitrate discharge from the aquifer were estimated from seepage meters sitting on top of the streambed and by methods involving streamwater measurements (the latter two classes of measurements are affected by nitrate loss by biogeochemical processes in the streambed and channel).  We showed that the transit time distribution (TTD) of the groundwater (the distribution of travel times through the aquifer, from recharge at the water table to discharge at a stream) could be obtained directly by combining measurements of groundwater discharge rate and age-dating tracer concentrations, and that the estimates obtained were robust (i.e., the results were not sensitive to the hydrologic conditions, the choice of tracer, or the details of where the sampling points were located in the streambed).  The TTDs showed very little discharge of young (0-10 year old) groundwater through the streambed of the study site, indicating a lack of groundwater recharge near the stream channel.  The TTD shows the rate at which pollution introduced at the water table makes its way through the aquifer to the stream.  By combining measured TTDs with other data on nitrate concentrations in recharge, we developed a method to predict future trends in nitrate output from an aquifer to a stream without relying on long groundwater quality monitoring programs or complex numerical computer models (only single sampling campaigns of a few days are needed).  The results provide additional tools to water managers for quantifying, understanding, and predicting present and future nitrate transport through polluted aquifers and into streams.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/27/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David P Genereux"
