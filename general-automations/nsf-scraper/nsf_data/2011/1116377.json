 "awd_abstract_narration": "Operational and safety goals for the built environment demand robust, scalable and reliable large\r\nscale monitoring for infrastructure systems. High performance real-time event detection and decision making\r\nrequires models and algorithms to process large amounts of data from dense sensor networks deployed\r\nin these systems. Despite advances in the development of detection algorithms for such networks, there are\r\ntwo widely recognized and conflicting obstacles: detection rules need to be sufficiently complex to adapt to\r\nthe spatiotemporal changes in the environment, requiring the sharing of data; but rules are constrained by\r\nstatistical performance guarantees and computation and communicational budgets imposed by the network.\r\nThis project addresses these challenges by developing a fundamentally new approach that jointly accounts\r\nfor statistical detection, communication constraints and distributed computation.\r\nThis research develops a framework that integrates the distributed computation and communication constraints\r\nof the underlying network infrastructure with flexible stochastic modeling and learning algorithms\r\nwith spatiotemporal data. The modeling and algorithms enable simultaneous and sequential decision making\r\nat many local sites, by borrowing information across the network in a statistically coherent and computationally\r\nefficient manner. Combining the formalism of sequential change point detection, nonparametric and\r\nprobabilistic graphical models and spatiotemporal statistics, the project develops distributed and sequential\r\nmessage-passing algorithms for detecting changes in the underlying distributions generating network data.\r\nThe models developed also offer new theoretical understanding of the trade-offs between statistical model\r\ncomplexity, distributed computation efficiency, and structure of communication constraints within the network.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary research brings together students and researchers from different areas, utilizing\r\nand developing knowledge and cross-disciplinary skills in the fields of computer science, statistics, signal\r\nprocessing and civil engineering.",
