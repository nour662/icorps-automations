 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many applications in science and engineering encounter the problem of\r\nidentifying and processing topologically interesting features in the\r\ndigital representation of a geometry or data. Such features often need\r\nto be optimal with respect to some metric (measurement). It is\r\nrecognized that homology groups from algebraic topology play an\r\nessential role in these computations. Although the study of structural\r\nproperties of the homology groups has a rich history in mathematics,\r\ntheir computations in combination with geometry are not that well\r\nstudied. The principal investigators (PIs) propose to study these\r\nfundamental questions thoroughly, along with their connections to\r\npractical problems from science and engineering.\r\nIntellectual merit: Efficient solutions of the optimality questions in\r\nhomology computations require both mathematical and algorithmic\r\ndevelopments. The PIs bring aboard these required expertise. Apart\r\nfrom the synergistic effect of the proposed study on mathematics and\r\ntheoretical computer science, the close ties with various applications\r\nin science and engineering will play a synergistic role between\r\ncomputational fields such as computer graphics, computer vision,\r\nsensor networks, computer aided design, and scientific fields such as\r\nbiology, physics, chemistry, and others.\r\nBroader impacts: Optimization of aspects of homology groups provides\r\nimportant insights in many scientific and engineering applications\r\nranging from tunnels in protein molecules to voids in large\r\nmachines. Solutions of such problems can aid in the manufacturing of\r\nbetter machines, designing of new drugs, and rapid modeling of\r\ncustomized objects. The educational impact of this project is in a\r\nlarge synergy between mathematics and computer science motivated by\r\nreal applications. Course notes, internet distributions, and software\r\nsystems developed through the project will enable the scientific\r\ncommunity to study challenging problems in geometry, topology, and\r\nalgorithms. Graduate students supported by the project will develop\r\nskills in mathematics and theoretical computer science and also in\r\nwriting robust, efficient, and user-friendly software.",

The shape can be presented with a discretized version commonly known as a triangulation, or only through a point sample commonly referred as data. The challenge was to identify or approximate the `good' cycles, ideally the optimal ones. Data in high dimensions poses more difficulty. Our aim was to design algorithms for these problems with provable certificates, that is, we wanted to assure that the output of the designed algorithm has certain guarantees under some conditions that are precisely spelled out. We achieved this goal with the following key outcome:</p>\n<p>O1: Given a discretized shape (triangulation) sitting in a geometric space, cyclic features are often captured by computing a set of cycles forming a basis for the spaec of all cycles. There are well known algorithms for computing them. But, often the applications in question benefit when the computed cycle for a class is the shortest. This problem is known to be hard (NP-hard). Nevertheless, we showed in [1]&nbsp; that the problem is tractable (solvable in polynomial time) if the input satisfies a mild condition. This result spawned further results in the field.</p>\n<p>O2: Insted of computing a shortest cycle in a class, one may need to compute a shortest basis itself, that is, a set of cycles that generates the entire space of the cycles and whose total length is the smallest among all such possible sets of cycles. This problem was known to be hard as well for cycles of dimension greater than one. The open question about the 1-dimensional cycles was settled in this project. We first designed a polynomial time greedy algorithm for it in [2] and later improved its complexity in [3].</p>\n<p>O3: In computer graphics and geometric modeling, processing three dimensional shapes plays a central role. Computing some topological features such as `holes' become important in these applications. There were several attempts before to pinpoint the region that constitutes the `holes' in a shape. Drawing upon algebraic topology,&nbsp; we gave a concrete definition of `holes'&nbsp; in terms of cycles that can be of&nbsp; two types: `handles' and `tunnels', and presented an efficient algorithm in [4] to compute them. The algorithm used Reeb graphs for the first time to compute the handles and tunnels.</p>\n<p>O4: Often it is useful to simplify a shape to a lower diemsnional object for facilitating further analysis. For a function defined on a shape (such as temperature defined on the surface of earth), one can define a one dimensional structure called Reeb graph that preserves many structural information related to the function. We showed a structural result on Reeb graphs that was unknown before. In particular, in [5] we showed that the cycles in a Reeb graph necessarily come from the ones present in the original space. We also presented an algorithm to compute an approximation of the Reeb graphs from a point sample.</p>\n<p>O5: Two software were produced in this project that have been released for public use.
