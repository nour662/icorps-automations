The conference will   bring together faculty, researchers and students in the rapidly growing interdisciplinary field of biomedical engineering to discuss the challenging ethical issues faced by biomedical engineers in their research and practice.  Biomedical engineering is responsible for many of the dramatic advances in modern medicine. However, biomedical technology has also contributed to dilemmas and has challenged some of our moral values. These include ethical issues in stem cell research & cloning, conflicts of interest, allocation of scarce resources, research misconduct, animal experimentation, clinical trials and marketing of new medical devices and many other new emerging issues.  Research and development executives from biomedical companies will also be invited. International participants will also be welcomed to present papers at this conference. The goal of this conference will be to present an overview and an in-depth discussion of the ethical issues encountered in bioengineering research and practice that are presently being conducted at various institutions and biomedical industry.\r\n\r\nThe conference is expected to have a broad spectrum of attendees (faculty, scientists, philosophers, students, physicians, lawyers and industry representatives).",
