The XRD would complement the PIs calorimetric investigations of the thermodynamic behavior of solid solutions of silicates including mics, feldspars and feldspathoids and zeolites.  Experimental thermodynamic data informs models of behavior of phases in the deep crust and XRD studies will elucidate the crystallographic and crystal-chemical principles that govern thermal expansion of Earth important mineral solid solutions.   The PI at this undergraduate institution actively engages students in experiential learning with state-of-the-art techniques in crystallography and thermodynamics and their application to scientific research problems.   \r\n\r\n***",
