To bring together leading researchers in atomic, molecular and optical physics to assess the state of theoretical research in the field and to formulate a vision for theoretical atomic, molecular, and optical physics (TAMOP) for the next decade.\r\n\r\nII. To survey the current organizational and funding landscape in TAMOP, including the balance between individual investigators, groups of investigators, centers and institutes, and types of institutions, and to suggest general guidelines for the next decade.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the workshop lies in the discussion of the state-of-the-art in frontier research areas of atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics and quantum information science, including: atomic and molecular structure and collisions; strong-field and ultrafast processes; cold atoms and degenerate gases, including cold collisions; quantum optics and quantum information.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the workshop will be its anticipated impact on the future of AMO physics. An important educational impact will be to inform researchers in the various subareas about the overall state of the field and hence support cross fertilization.",
