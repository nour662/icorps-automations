 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hot Electron Interchange Instability is a commonly observed phenomenon associated with the creation of a hot population of electrons in a low density, collisionless plasma. In this experiment, a pair of high temperature superconducting magnets are suspended inside an 18\" spherical vacuum chamber, cryogenically cooled using liquid nitrogen and arranged to form an axisymmetric magnetic cusp.  A 2.45 GHz microwave source is used to create a hot population of electrons in a low density plasma using electron cyclotron resonance heating leading to the observation of the hot electron interchange instability.  Low frequency fluctuations will be observed using an array of high impedence floating probes and electron transport will be observed using an array of particle detectors.  Special attention will be given to the role of the magnetic cusp on the hot electron interchange instability and the conditions for stabilization of the low frequency  fluctuations.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to support a developing program of experimental plasma physics research in a high-school laboratory.  Funds from this project would be used to procure a 2kW 2.45 GHz microwave power system to augment an existing facility at Stuyvesant High School.  Students would have the opportunity to learn and apply the experimental techniques used in a modern plasma physics laboratory to conduct real scientific research.\r\n\r\nThe research opportunities are to study electron cyclotron resonance heating and the hot electron interchange instability in a magnetic cusp.  Students would learn to use an array of diagnostics including: langmuir probes, ion saturation probes, faraday cups, particle arrays, photodiode arrays and high gain op-amps and will use spectrometers and oscilloscopes to study the hot electron interchange instability and its transport. The PI would coordinate teams of students who would be encouraged to design, fabricate and install research components, to utilize an array of diagnostics to study the properties of plasma and to write and submit student-centered research papers to various scientific competitions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDevelopment of a Plasma Source for Studying Plasma Physics\n\nThe intellectual focus of our research program has been to explore the principles of plasma physics in a scientific laboratory.  During our program, several groups of high school students, supervised by science teachers and industry professionals, have been introduced to the study of plasma physics with activities consisting of students designing, constructing and testing various plasma sources with the goal of supporting the pursuit of scientific research by the next generation of scientists.\n\nOur research program has included a detailed focus on advanced laboratory techniques and application centered design to provide our students with the opportunity to utilize the tools used in a scientific laboratory to study the subject of plasma physics and to facilitate the publication of student centered research papers written by students for various science competitions.\n\nAn important goal of our research program has been to improve student achievement in science by providing high school students with the opportunity to discover the underlying principles of plasma physics in a laboratory setting.  Research studies suggest that students excel in science when they participate in the discovery of the principles of science through structured discovery learning.\n\nBy supporting our research program, the National Science Foundation has provided our students with the opportunity to explore and advance their ideas and skills, under the supervision of science teachers and industry professionals.  We anticipate that this will result in better trained scientists and more eager participants in the process of scientific discovery, and we also anticipate that various scientific discoveries will be made leading to publications that will further support the development of science.\n\nIn our research program, our students participated in the design and development of an experimental apparatus used to produce a wide range of plasma.  This apparatus, which consists of a vacuum chamber, vacuum pumps, a plasma source and a power supply, has allowed our science teachers and students to produce \"ionized gas\" ranging from low density, low temperature plasma as found in a fluorescent tube to high density, high temperature plasma as found in the solar corona with plasma sources that utilize capacitive, inductive, microwave and pulsed power technologies.\n\nDuring the past several years, our science teachers and students have produced and confined plasma in the laboratory with several groups of high school students participating in the study of plasma physics to learn about designing and engineering experimental apparatus with the goal of conducting scientific research in plasma physics.\n\nOur project outcomes and accomplishments have included the design and development of a cost effective plasma source that can be used to produce \u00e6ionized gas\u00c6 for the study of plasma physics, and our research activities involving the experimental study of the hot electron interchange instability in a magnetic cusp are ongoing with research activities continuing for the foreseeable future until our microwave powered experimental apparatus has been completed and our research questions have been explored.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/26/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott Thomas"
