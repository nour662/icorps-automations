 "awd_abstract_narration": "Viruses, worms, and other self-propagating malware remain significant ongoing security threats to almost all sectors of the nation's cyber-infrastructure, including government, business, and home consumers.  The escalating rate of new malware appearances increasingly threatens to outpace the defense community's ability to maintain effective detection systems.  This is in part because many malware detection algorithms identify malicious software based on syntactic features.  Polymorphic malware continually evolves new syntaxes at it propagates, introducing hundreds or thousands of new syntaxes per day that implement the same malicious behavior.  Discovering practical, scalable techniques for reliably detecting new polymorphic malware variants is therefore one of the most significant challenges currently facing the computer security industry.\r\n\r\nThis project develops hybrid static-dynamic technologies that detect malware based on semantic rather than purely syntactic code features.  Thus, malware is identified based on the meaning of its malicious programming rather than the syntax with which it implements it.  Malicious payloads are identified by applying traditionally static code analyses to decrypted memory pages intercepted dynamically at runtime.  A major goal of the project is to develop technologies that are scalable and practical for standard computer hardware and operating systems.  This will allow wide-scale deployment of results, and help to protect the nation from distributed attacks that compromise large numbers of low-priority targets to attack higher-priority targets.  Results from the research will lead to powerful new strategies, concepts, and practical tools that give defenders a significant new advantage in the virus-antivirus arms race, and improving the national cyber-infrastructure's resilience against cyber-attacks.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMalicious software (\"malware\") attacks are an increasingly dangerous class of threats to modern computing systems, posing serious risks to our critical infrastructure, telecommunications, emergency preparedness, health care privacy, and military personnel.  One major reason malware attacks continue to succeed against even skillful defenders is the capability of modern malware to adapt and mutate in infinite varieties to bypass conventional defenses.  Such mutation is known as malware polymorphism.\n\nThis project has forged scientific methodologies, algorithms, and technologies that overcome conventional defenses? brittleness to polymorphism, to detect and/or thwart malware attacks in ways that are independent of its polymorphic capabilities.  Project discoveries include:\n\n(1) the cultivation of a new science of automated program transformation, which allows defenses to look inside software and remove potentially dangerous program functionalities instead of waiting to see if malicious behavior manifests as the program executes;\n\n(2) web security technologies that allow web page authors to embed defensive scripts into their pages, which protect visitors from malicious third-party content (e.g., malicious online advertisements) without the need for visitors to explicitly download or install any new software;\n\n(3) scientific methodologies for mathematically proving that certain malware defenses reliably protect against all attacks in certain important attack classes---even future attack instances in the class that are presently unknown to defenders;\n\n(4) active defense technologies that empower sophisticated defenders to \"fight back\" against malware attackers by reverse-infecting the adversary's command-and-control infrastructure;\n\n(5) cyber-deceptive technologies that allow advanced defenders to misdirect adversaries into revealing critical new offensive technologies before those technologies become threats, allowing defenders to anticipate future attacks; and\n\n(6) new malware defense technologies for cloud computing systems, which house increasing volumes of privacy-sensitive data, and are therefore prime targets of malware attacks.\n\nInnovations and discoveries arising from this project were published in several of the highest-impact, most competitive and rigorous peer-reviewed scientific venues in the field, received multiple best paper awards, and are now being used in practice to enhance the security of military computing systems.  Educational outcomes include the development of new curricula and laboratory experiences for training future generations of IT experts in advanced detection and mitigation of malware attacks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin Hamlen"
