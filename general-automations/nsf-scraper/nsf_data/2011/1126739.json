In decades past, batch processing meant turning over computation to a remote dispatcher, retrieving only the results of the isolated and distant computational process.  As users have evolved to expect greater interactivity with their copious mobile devices and other forms of mobile computation, the evolution of the ?cloud? as a computational paradigm ha become much more interactive. Melete promises to extend this interactive paradigm to cluster computing in new and innovative ways. \r\nThe developed instrument will enable research in biology, visualization of computational materials, displaying configuration space for computational mathematics, mapping and displaying data from robot mapped locations (e.g. archeology sites, urban environments, etc), and architecture visualization.\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis proposal promises benefits to society by balancing activities between research and research training contexts. This approach is aligned with NSF priorities in cyberlearning, cyberinfrastructure, and beyond. The proposal's partnership with Southern University (an HBCU) in\r\nboth research and classroom impacts, building upon five years of successful collaboration in \"Cybertools,\" provides further potential and promise for broader impact.",
