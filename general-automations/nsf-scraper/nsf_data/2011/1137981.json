 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative research: EAGER: Exploratory Study of Nano Ultrasonic Machining Process\r\n\r\nAbstract. This collaborative research work will study the feasibility of vibration assisted target specific nanoscale machining of brittle material. The goal of the research is to generate fundamental knowledge of nano ultrasonic machining process by conducting rigorous analytical and experimental investigations to understand the mechanism of material removal, the range of machinable feature sizes, effect of machining parameters on the productivity of the machined feature, and the uncertainty and sustainability of the nano ultrasonic machining process. A commercial atomic force microscope (AFM) will be used in this exploratory research as an experimental platform to perform ultrasonic nano abrasive machining, as well as nano measurement. The scope of the research includes a process model formulation to predict the material removal, based on appropriate set of process parameters. The scientific barriers such as lack of knowledge base of ductile and brittle mode erosion at nano scale models, and technical barriers such as behavior of abrasive powder at ultrasonic frequency and nanoscale, form the main risks of this study. However, if successful, this project will lead to a new and very effective process for the accurate nano scale machining of brittle materials used in electronic, medical, automotive and aviation industries.\r\n\r\nSuccess of this research is expected to have a transformative effect on the target specific nanomachinability of a wide variety of both conductive and nonconductive materials. Potential applications include high precision DNA detection devices, interconnects nano packaging, and low cost mask correction for electronics manufacturing. Results of this study may serve as prelude to abrasive based picofinishing technology. Outcome of this project will be synergized with our other nano machining activities to educate graduate and undergraduate students in manufacturing courses offered at University of Cincinnati and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This experience will be used to nurture training and learning within underrepresented minorities and to augment the ongoing partnership with area school community. The results of this research will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, presentations and university?s websites, short courses at professional society meetings and reports to NSF.\r\n",
