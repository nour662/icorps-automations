 "awd_abstract_narration": "US college and universities are experiencing a dramatic decline in enrollment of computing majors, despite a predicted, rapid increase in future jobs in the computer science (CS) and information technology (IT) sectors. This reflects a decline in the number of students taking the AP computer science exam. To address this issue, this project will build statewide networks of college, middle school, and high school faculty who will offer workshops and provide continuing support during the academic year. \r\n\r\nThe networks will be set up in three different states (North Carolina, South Carolina, and Mississippi). College and university faculty will work directly with middle school and high school teachers in teaching and learning innovative and effective ways of introducing computing and computer programming, and in incorporating computational thinking into other disciplines. This project scales up a previous, successful collaborative project for students and teachers using the Alice 3D programming environment. The approach focuses on a strong core of fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques in an object-oriented, interactive environment. The project's external evaluation will include the collection of qualitative and quantitative data on teacher instruction and students' enrollment and performance. \r\n\r\nThe project will train approximately 265 teachers directly, and provide support for master teachers to provide subsequent training for other teachers in their home districts. This project has the potential to increase the amount and effectiveness of instruction in object-oriented programming concepts and problem-solving to a large number of middle school and high school students. By training middle school and high school teachers in the proposed approach, and by providing support networks and building community, the project should be able to impact students throughout three states. Developed curricular materials will be stored in an online, searchable database to be freely available to all teachers. In making computing, computer science, programming, and computational thinking more attractive to middle school and high school students, the project team expects to encourage more students to major in STEM, and particularly computing, at the college level.",

Its importance and popularity havecome about as technology is increasingly intertwining with our daily lives,and predictions are indicating a shortage of technology workers in thefuture.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, K-12 education has been slow in incorporating computer scienceinto all grade levels. One of the reasons why is that schools have\"technology\" or \"digital media\" courses. These typically teach keyboardinglessons and how to use software tools, such as word processor orspreadsheets. That is not computer science! Computer science is about usingcomputational techniques to solve problems, especially problems that wouldbe too difficult to solve with pencil and paper. Because of misconceptionsbetween technology and computer science, schools have been slow toincorporate computer science into their curriculum.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our project is called Adventures with Alice Programming. Since 2007 with anITEST grant followed by this ITEST Scale up grant, we have provided annualprofessional development to K-12 teachers to learn programming, and toguide them in creating lesson plans that integrate computing into theirdiscipline. The Alice programming language is a free programmingenvironment for novices to learn programming by creating animations of 3-Dobjects in a virtual world. Alice was created by Randy Pausch at CMU.&nbsp; Our major activity is providing professional development to teachers tolearn programming and to guide them in creating lesson plans.&nbsp; We havesites in the states of North Carolina (NC), South Carolina (SC), California(CA) and Nebraska (NE).&nbsp; These sites run professional development workshopson Alice for middle school/high school teachers. The NC and SC workshopshave run beginner workshops since summer 2011 and followup workshops everysummer since 2012.&nbsp; The CA site ran workshops in summer 2014 and 2015. TheNebraska workshop started running workshops in summer 2016.&nbsp; The NCworkshops are held at Duke University, the SC workshops at the College ofCharleston and Columbia College, the CA workshops in the San Francisco/SanJose area, and the NE workshops in Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>\n<p>All our professional development workshops are residential two-weekworkshops. In the first week, teachers learn fundamental programming bybuilding Alice programs. During the second week, teachers develop lessonplans in their discipline. The following summer, teachers attend a followupworkshop where teachers present material they have developed or studentwork, and we provide some instruction or updates to Alice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have also organized four large Alice Symposia at Duke University since2006 to build community, with two of the symposia as part of this grant.Beginner and followup workshops are held at the same time so beginners canlearn from the followup teachers, and the followup teachers can present ina larger venue. We also schedule other short workshops around the Symposiumfor followup teachers to gain new knowledge. The Third Alice Symposium tookplace on June 19, 2013. The program included a Keynote by Tiffany Barnesfrom NCSU, papers, posters, invited speakers and an Alice contest forstudents. We organized six workshops on Alice or related topics inconjunction with the Symposium. The Symposium and workshops were attendedby over 120 participants. The fourth Alice Symposium was held on June 20,2017. The program included a Keynote by Thomas Price from NCSU, fiveinvited talks, and teacher demos.&nbsp; A Workshop on Alice 2 to Alice 3 washeld the next day, organized by Wanda Dann and Don Slater. There were 81attendees at the Alice Symposium and 28 people attended the Alice 2 toAlice 3 Workshop.</p>\n<p>Our findings indicate that our summer professional development workshopswere both positive and productive for participants. Those teachersparticipating in our study indicated that workshops helped them to increasetheir knowledge, skills, and abilities with Alice.

For all the sites, the participantsincreased their content knowledge using Alice, as evidenced by significantgains on content assessments.
