 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the Learning Assistants Become Teachers (LABT) project, the University of Montana (UM) in partnership with the Missoula County Public Schools is recruiting thirty individuals to complete baccalaureate degrees in mathematics, chemistry, biology, geosciences, environmental science, computer science, or physics and providing them up to three years of scholarship support to complete their STEM degree and earn secondary teacher licensure.\r\n\r\nThe LABT project is designed to transform the culture of mathematics and science teacher preparation on the UM campus through the recruitment of STEM undergraduates to become assistants in large section mathematics and science courses. The students work in pairs, and with faculty and graduate assistants, to engage other undergraduates as peer tutors and this provides them with experiences as facilitators of learning in anticipation of becoming teachers in middle and high school classrooms.  Additionally, the Learning Assistant model is being extended into elementary and secondary schools where the Noyce Scholars assist master teachers in high-need school districts.  Noyce Scholars are being prepared to work in western Montana communities, which are rural and represent a diversity of cultures, including different Native American tribes.  \r\n\r\nThe goals of the LABT project are to:\r\n1. design a recruitment and Noyce Scholarship award strategy that increases the number of middle/high school mathematics and science teachers entering the profession prepared to teach effectively in rural and frontier areas;\r\n2. improve the quality of education for Noyce scholars by instituting a summer field science workshop and an academic year pedagogy seminar;\r\n3. improve the quality of education for both Noyce scholars and undergraduate students in targeted mathematics and science courses by using Noyce scholars as Learning Assistants (peer mentors using supportive teaching strategies); and\r\n4. establish a culture at UM that engages faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates in the learning of mathematics and science content through research-based teaching.\r\n\r\nThe LABT is characterized by freshmen and sophomore summer internships, modifications to courses in which Learning Assistants work, pedagogy seminars, mentoring by master teachers, and online wiki and Moodle mentoring of Noyce Scholars as they transition into the early years of their teaching careers.  Freshmen and sophomore summer internships in ecological field placements serve as a first exposure to teaching, while serving as one recruitment mechanism for Noyce Scholars.  Semester-long pedagogy seminars for all Learning Assistants, graduate teaching assistants, and faculty interested in the model or teaching within the targeted courses will be provided.  STEM courses in which Learning Assistants are used are being customized to include greater use of small-group work and questioning techniques that encourage mathematical and scientific discourse, including challenging assumptions, revealing contradictions and constructing new understandings.  Participating faculty recruit Learning Assistants from the best and brightest former students so that subsequent course offerings become transformed through the use of these Noyce Scholars.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the number, quality, and diversity of mathematics and science teachers with majors in STEM disciplines ensures a depth of content knowledge which, when linked to the skill set developed as Learning Assistants, provides novice teachers with a solid foundation for success in the teaching profession.  As the LABT project focuses specifically on preparing future mathematics and science teachers for success in rural/frontier areas of the west, and high-need reservation areas, persistent patterns in which these areas are educationally underserved are being thwarted.",

Students in the seminar also create, disseminate, and evaluate midterm evaluations providing valuable feedback for themselves and course instructors.&nbsp; At the end of their experience, LAs create posters describing what they did, what they learned, and what they would do differently.

Upon expanding the program to include non-Noyce Scholars as Learning Assistants (LAs), one hundred forty-three students have served as LAs in STEM and non-STEM courses in up to two pedagogy seminars per semester. Summer symposiums for faculty and graduate students to learn more about the implementation of the LA program will now be fully funded by the University.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> During the implementation of the grant, efforts grew to take the Learning Assistant Model (LAM) into secondary schools through working with local teachers during a pre-service teacher's methods course, summer mathematics/science field internships, and graduating Noyce scholars implementing the LAM in their schools and classrooms. During the third semester of the Noyce scholars' pedagogy seminar, they worked as LAs in a college classroom, but also practiced implementing LAMs into their pre-service fieldwork course and future classroom. As part of their coursework, they created classroom-ready activities that focused on teaching students how to ask open-ended, higher-order questions. Additionally, they created and taught an LA-style lesson plan that met content standards for two different classes and encouraged students to actively engage in learning to increase conceptual understanding. At the end of each semester, Noyce scholars received a packet of LAM focused short activities and full lesson plans that they could utilize in their upcoming student teaching experiences and classrooms.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Throughout, researchers learned about and organized three different models for implementing a LAM into secondary mathematics and science classrooms. They define those three models as a Whole-School Model (WSM), Two-Classroom Model (TCM), and One-Classroom Model (OCM).</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">The WSM looks most similar to the LAM created by CU-Boulder (Otero, Pollock, McCray, &amp; Finkelstein, 2006). In the WSM, teachers recruit and train one to two students to be LAs in their classroom. These students have already taken the class, have a solid understanding of the content material, and are willing to work with both their teacher and peers on a regular basis. Similar to the CU-Boulder program, the main role of LAs is to help facilitate discussion in class and guide their peers to a better understanding, rather than simply telling students the answers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">In the TCM, two entire classes work together on a project or for a class period. These combined classes can be comprised of different subject areas, where both classes are taught how to be LAs and both act as LAs during different parts of the project. For example, the mathematics students help guide science students during the mathematics parts of the projects and the science students help guide the mathematics students during the science parts of the project. The combined classes could also be comprised of two classes from the same subject area where one class is more advanced and are taught how to be LAs.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">In the OCM, teachers teach the entire classroom how to be LAs and lessons give all students the opportunity to act as a LA. For this model to be successful, teachers stress the importance of asking questions and guiding peers to an answer rather than telling them the answer.
