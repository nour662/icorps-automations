 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning visit is to use monitoring data collected from various structural systems in Korea in order to apply, validate, and test non-parametric methodologies. Without a priori information or physical assumptions on the structures of interest, which requires expensive field/laboratory measurements, non-parametric methodologies can be used to make useful engineering judgments using data from a minimal number of sensors. Unlike the US, the monitoring of important civil infrastructure in Korea is mandated by laws, and access to our Korean counterparts? rich data pools will be important to developing and validating the methodologies.\r\n\r\nThis visit and the ensuing research efforts will positively impact how voluminous sensor data can be meaningfully and accurately interpreted. Its importance is highly emphasized in the current development of the Long-Term Bridge Performance (LTBP) Program by FHWA and the Landslide Hazards Program by USGS. This planning visit is to catalyze international research collaborations, and it is expected to yield ongoing research ventures in the near future. Monitoring civil infrastructure using sensor-based instrumentation is highly multi-disciplinary, and the graduate student involved in this planning visit will have a unique opportunity of being exposed to real-life needs of multi-disciplinary research.",
