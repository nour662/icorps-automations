The approach is to acquire a Raith e-LiNE Plus E-Beam Lithography (EBL) tool. It will be placed in the UTD Cleanroom Research Laboratory (CRL) to provide advanced lithographic capabilities.  There is no EBL capability in north Texas to facilitate university and corporate research. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This EBL tool will accelerate existing research and enable new research avenues in an astonishing array of fields. Example areas enhanced include: Nanoscale Electronic Devices, Sensors, Manufacturing, Materials, and Photonics.  Many researchers will be enabled by this EBL tool combined with the capabilities already resident in the CRL. The CRL has a large and growing user base (>210) and the capability to make this EBL tool productive in the long term.  UTD faculty and staff, together with colleagues throughout north Texas have the funding and expertise to make the most of this capability. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The EBL acquisition will enhance a broad range of activities, people, research areas, and institutions. It will enhance research and education in the CRL including a variety of classes in multiple disciplines, both graduate and undergraduate (crucial to UTD?s teaching mission). In addition, it will enhance the training of high school students through summer research programs. All nanoscale research can be enhanced and it will foster new industrial collaborations.  It will enable the researchers of numerous major universities and companies throughout north Texas and beyond.",
