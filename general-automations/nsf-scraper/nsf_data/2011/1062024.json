 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program coordinated by the University of Michigan offering research experiences at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN). The LHC is currently taking data and research results are already beginning to emerge. The research at CERN represents the frontier for experimental high energy physics for several decades to come.   Students working on LHC focused problems at CERN experience an intellectual apprenticeship and learn to understand the nature of international scientific collaboration and the questions and methods of modern physics. The undergraduate students will spend nine weeks at CERN participating in research projects, attending a physics lecture series and interacting with European scientists and science students. The program orientation contains components designed to help them learn how to live in Geneva, instruction in computing, seminars on physics and ethics along with tours of the CERN experiments. The students will gather frequently to give talks about their research activities, learning about the protocols and techniques of physics presentations. Each day they also work with assigned mentors on current physics problems. An onsite Coordinator is present at CERN to assist the students with any matters related to program or personal needs. Each student must give a final talk on their accomplishments and participate in the program evaluation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe University of Michigan has coordinated a REU Site Program at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) since 2001.  Each summer 14-15 undergraduate physics and engineering students are selected from about 200 applicants.  The students selected for the program have outstanding academic records and excellent computer skills.  Since the program began,  over 150 students have spent a research summer at CERN.  The students chosen for the program attend very small as well as very large schools.  There are special recruiting efforts designed to attract student applicants from under-represented groups.\n\nThe selected students spend 9 weeks (mid June through mid-August) at CERN participating in individually mentored research activities.  Numerous experiments are underway at the laboratory at any given time and can be in various states or readiness, ranging from installation of equiment to final publication of results.  Some of the CERN based experiments hosting our students were CMS,ATRAP,ASACUSA, ATLAS, ISOLEDE, NA61/SHINE and COMPASS.  In addition to their research activities, students are introduced to current topics in physics thorugh the CERN Summer Student Lecture Series.  Some of the topics from past lectures are:\n\nFrom Raw Data to Physics Resuslts\nThe Higgs\nPhysics at Hadron Colliders\nAccelerators and Cancer Therapy\nFundamental Concepts in Particle Physics\nThe Standard Model\nThe Search Beyond the Standard Model\nNeutrino Physics\nFuture Accelerators\n\n\nUS high school physics teachers can also participate in CERN activities through the CERN HST (High School Teacher) Program.  Beginning in summer 2006, five teachers from across the United States have joined European physics teachers for three week in July.  The teachers are selected by QUARKNET (http://quarknet.fnal.gov) with the logistics of their participation arranged by the UM-CERN REU program .  At CERN they  learn about advances in modern physics at CERN and work in groups to develop physics curriculum materials for use in high school physics classrooms. They return to their classrooms with a broader background in new physics discoveries and with a new appreciation of their membership in a global teaching community. \n\nThe participation of the high school physics teachers provides young high school students with a preview of the opportunities that they can access in college.  The oportunity for outstanding young science and engineering students to participate in cutting-edge research at leading international  laboratories is insrumental in their growth into globally competitive scientists.  Their participation  is a crucial step in providing our future US  workforce and in   maintaining US leadership in science and technology. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Homer A Neal"
