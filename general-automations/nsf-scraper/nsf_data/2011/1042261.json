 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to utilize a combination of new and existing space- and ground-based data to characterize the mechanisms and pathways by which large-scale atmospheric wave drivers are able to modify the low-latitude ionospheric dynamo and subsequent motion and density of the whole ionosphere.   The region of wave-ionosphere interaction and vertical coupling will be observed directly using the highly precise Arecibo incoherent scatter radar (ISR) in Puerto Rico, while COSMIC satellite measurements of ionospheric electron density, TIMED satellite wind measurements, and ground-based GPS measurements of total electron content will be used to identify the global structure of planetary-scale waves that underlie the observations.   An initial focus of the analysis will use existing data from these platforms acquired during a major stratospheric warming event and strong ionospheric wave activity, and new ISR data will be acquired from Arecibo Observatory as part of the project.  This work will support the education and research training of a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student as well as involve research participation by undergraduates.  This collaborative effort is a partnership between two universities, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and Arecibo Observatory.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSummary of outcomes related to intellectual merit\n\nAt altitudes over 100 km above the Earth\u00c6s surface, sunlight breaks apart atoms and molecules in the atmosphere, creating charged particles.  This layer of charged particles is called the ionosphere.  Global-scale observations of the ionosphere that have been made over the last decade have shown wave-like structures in this layer.  It is a generally accepted scientific theory that these wave-like structures are associated with wave patterns in the winds in the atmosphere.  However, the waves that correspond most closely to the wave-like patterns in the ionosphere only exist at much lower altitudes, so something else must be varying their signal to the altitudes where the wave-like patterns in the ionosphere are observed. \n\nThis work aimed to find what was communicating these patterns to the ionosphere.  To do this, we used observations from a network of powerful radars known as incoherent scatter radars, which were taken at the same time as measurements of the ionosphere taken by a constellation of satellites known as COSMIC.\n\nFor our first of such coordinated observations came from January 2010.  During this time period, we were able to see the waves in the atmosphere at around 100 km above the Earth\u00c6s surface at the same time as seeing the wave-like pattern in the ionosphere at around 300 km above the Earth\u00c6s surface.  We showed that the effect of the wave in the atmosphere was being carried to those higher altitudes, at least in part by an intermediary &ndash; a second wave that appears at around 90 km above the Earth\u00c6s surface and can travel to much higher altitudes.  These results were summarized in two peer-reviewed publications, both of which were published in 2012.\n\nFor our second set of coordinated observations, we solicited a new set of observations through what is known as an URSI World Day Campaign.  This involved submitting a written proposal to the URSI World Day committee and presenting the scientific case for these observations in-person at the CEDAR workshop. This proposal was accepted and we coordinated with the groups who operate each of the power incoherent scatter radars to carry out this observational campaign in August 2011.
