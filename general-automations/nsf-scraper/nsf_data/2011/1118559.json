 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides partial funding for a joint workshop with the National Science Foundation, the Chinese Society of Mechanical Engineering and Tsinghua University to facilitate the research collaboration between US and China in the field of integrated bio-nanomanufacturing.  This bi-lateral workshop will be held in Beijing, China; April 11-13, 2011.  The objective of this bilateral workshop is to bring together multi-disciplinary researchers to review the recent advances, challenges and future directions on Bio-Nano Integrated Manufacturing, its science, engineering, the novel processes, and the emerging applications in the field of engineering, biology and bioengineering. The tentative workshop topics include, but are not limited to:  1) Identify grand challenges for integrated bio-nano manufacturing for fabrication of biological machines, integrated cellular system, and advanced cellular models for biological, disease and drug studies; 2) Review enabling techniques on integrated bio-nano manufacturing, the manufacturing science, engineering, modeling, the novel processes; 3) Vision the future research and development on integrated bio-nanomanufacturing and explore synergies and collaborative opportunities at the interface of bio and nano manufacturing and its integration; 4) Opportunities for education curricula to train next generation of researchers, scientists, engineers and workforce in emerging integrated bio-nanomanufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of workshop will define challenges for bio-nano manufacturing and its integration for fabrication of emerging biological cellular systems and advanced cellular models in a broad 3D biology, disease, drug discovery and tissue science and engineering application. The workshop will also facilitate developing enabling techniques on integrated bio-nanomanufacturing, the bio-nanomanufacturing science, engineering, modeling, the novel processes, and provide guidance for federal agencies to vision the future research and development on integrated bio-nanomanufacturing.",
