These seminars have been held annually since 1981, and constitute the most important regular conference series for probabilists in the US.  Many of the participants work on such topics as Markov processes, Brownian motion, superprocesses, stochastic analysis, or mathematical finance. The primary goal is to provide a platform for the dissemination of the most recent significant progress in research, and to encourage the interaction between junior and established researchers. The program includes five one hour lectures given by invited speakers and informal sessions emphasizing open problems of current interest.",
