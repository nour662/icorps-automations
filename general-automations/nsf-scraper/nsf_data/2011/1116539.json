 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will conduct a series of user studies to investigate the effectiveness of error reporting with novice programming students. The studies will focus on how students understand error messages, the effectiveness of source-code highlighting, and the impact of language syntax on how students process errors.  The PIs will instrument a programming environment to collect fine-grained data on how students respond to errors.  Such scientific user studies, particularly at a fine-grained level, are rare in this context; the methodologies and tools developed for this project will be applicable to future studies. Study results will be used to improve programming environments for novice programmers with regards to interfaces for reporting errors and linguistic choices regarding syntax and type systems.  Findings will identify principles for others who design new programming tools for novices.  Results will be disseminated through the DrRacket environment, which is in wide use in introductory computing courses in universities, high schools, and after-school programs for middle school students.",

An \"error message\" is the report that a programmer receives in response to a mistake made when attempting to write or run a program. Mistakes can take many forms: the program may have a typo in the notation, be missing an expected part of the program text, have additional notation that the computer doesn't understand, or try to perform a nonsensical computation while executing (among others). In each case, the tool in which the programmer is writing the program must report the problem to the user, ideally in a way that helps the programmer identify and fix the underlying problem.</p>\n<p>In prior work, we had gathered data on what changes students made to programs upon receiving error messages and analyzed whether the students' actions were productive or meaningful. We conducted our studies in DrRacket, a popular programming tool for novice programmers that had been explicitly designed to support novices, particularly through its error messages. We identified several shortcomings in those messages. This project began as a followup to that initial work, seeking to design, deploy, and test alternative error-message presentation formats.</p>\n<p>We designed a new set of principles for wording and displaying error messages. &nbsp;Roughly, (a) we worded the messages to include direct references to each part of the code that mattered to the error, (b) we used different colored highlights to match each reference with the corresponding code fragment. Earlier error message displays (in DrRacket and others) would at most highlight one part of code that was relevant to an error, without necessarily explaining the connection between the highlight and the textual message display.
