The event brings together a high-quality team of leading American and Chinese researchers in computer vision and multimedia to offer a one-week educational and cultural exchange program to students and junior scholars from both US and China. The summer school provides a venue for the participants to explore a variety of aspects and applications on how to address the challenges in large-scale visual data/media acquisition, processing/computing, understanding, and search. The international interactions can foster new understanding and new collaborations in science, education, and culture.",
