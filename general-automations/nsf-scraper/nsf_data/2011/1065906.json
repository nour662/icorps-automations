 "awd_abstract_narration": "A US-China materials research grantees meeting and collaboration workshop is held on April 28-29, 2011, in San Francisco.  The workshop is jointly sponsored by NSF and the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (NNSFC). The dual objective of the event is to: (1) Bring together NSF-NNSFC joint grantees and leaders of the NSF International Materials Institutes to share experiences, best practices and lessons learned in various aspects of collaborative research and education; and (2) Bring together young scientists from the US and China to identify and discuss new opportunities for collaboration in diverse areas of materials research. Day 1 will focus on grantee interactions and Day 2 will highlight the efforts of young scientists and give them opportunities to interact with one another and with the senior researchers who have successfully obtained funding for joint US-China materials research projects. The workshop is organized in cooperation with Prof. Duan Weng of Tsinghua University in Beijing. \r\n\r\nThe event fosters important working relationships between the US and Chinese research communities for years to come. Building joint initiatives in materials research and education can strengthen the growing relationship between both countries, which will contribute to mutual understanding, prosperity and security. The workshop will contribute to understanding the effectiveness of existing joint funding programs with China as well as with other countries, and increase international cooperation in other areas of research and other parts of the world.",
