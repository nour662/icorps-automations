 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides a series of for-credit, applied learning modules that are given in parallel to the freshman and sophomore calculus courses. The modules are developed and led by faculty members from the Departments of Mathematical Science and Bioengineering. An important component of the project is that advanced undergraduate students serve as peer mentors to the STEM students who are taking the modules. This project recruits participants from all STEM majors with special efforts to recruiting from underrepresented groups such as women, minorities, first-generation college students, and community college transfers. Students have the opportunity to enroll in one applied learning module per semester for up to four semesters. The proposed modules emphasizes mathematics and statistics relevant to four biomedical research areas 1) orthopaedics, 2) infectious diseases, 3) heat propagation in the human body, 4) mammography and radiology. Students participate in field trips to visit facilities and labs related to their module. Each semester students have access to online faculty-developed audio-video materials via the project website.",
