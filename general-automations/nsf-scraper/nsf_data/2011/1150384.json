 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to understand the effect of student motivation and intention on conceptual understanding; conceptual understanding is important for engineering practice and innovation. The study will look broadly at students using a national survey which is followed by real time data collection; the project will develop new ways to collect data using smart-phone \"apps\".  \r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will occur when the results are translated into classroom practice at multiple institutions through partnerships with engineering faculty members.  The project will broadly disseminate the results to multiple audiences using a range of media.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has made significant contributions to engineering education with intellectual merit and broader impacts.  Consistent with the purpose of a CAREER award, this project has served as foundational research work and has resulted in additional funded and in-preparation projects as well as facilitating multiple fruitful and long-term collaborations. \n\nIntellectual Merit- By examining intersections of student motivation, approaches to learning and conceptual understanding as well as faculty perspectives on teaching, this research yielded important findings that have direct implications for engineering classrooms.  For example, using qualitative methods we found that a sampling of students (from two different institutions with different contexts) used primarily behaviorist approaches to learning and that this is a direct mismatch with the predominantly cognitive learning strategies captured by two major instruments currently used to measure student?s approaches to learning.  Based on our qualitative analysis, we then developed and began testing a survey instrument to capture the learning approaches adopted by engineering students.  We also found that situational motivation, i.e., in-the-moment considerations, such as short-term overload in homework or exams, can overshadow more stable, longer-term motivation directly and negatively impacting the approaches students take to learning.  For example, students in a time crunch sacrificed the deep learning approaches that take more time in favor of short-cuts that would yield a completed assignment.  From a research perspective, we learned that it is difficult but important to ask students about both situational and longer-term motivation.  At the same time, we found that faculty may not be aware of the unintended negative consequences of teaching approaches such as assigning repetitious problem sets or multiple classes having exams the same day.  Combining findings such as these that span student and faculty motivation, learning strategies adopted by students and faculty approaches to teaching, this project yielded critical findings about engineering learning systems; this research confirmed the importance of affective factors in cognition and learning.  In addition to the many specific research findings from this project that can inform both teaching practices and future research, tangible products from this project include: 1) a preliminarily tested survey to measure engineering student?s learning strategies, 2) interview protocols to measure student?s approaches to learning, student?s motivation towards learning, and faculty motivation and approaches to teaching, 3) the Naturalistic Observations of Metacognitive Engagement (NOME) coding strategy, a coding scheme that can be used to identify metacognitive engagement in naturalistic settings involving undergraduate engineering students, and 4) multiple journal manuscripts, dissertations, and conference papers, posters and presentations, and multiple workshops and invited talks that provided insights for faculty on how to engage students in learning.\n\nBroader Impacts- Beyond the tangible work products and knowledge contributions, this project has also contributed to the development of the next generation of engineering education researchers.
