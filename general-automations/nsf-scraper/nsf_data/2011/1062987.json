 "awd_abstract_narration": "A reward has been made to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies to offer its Translational Ecology for Undergraduates Program to 10 students for 12 weeks in the summers of 2011-2015. Students join the unique Cary Institute community of nearly 100 scientists, educators and staff. Students become producers of ecological knowledge, gaining first-hand experience of the rewards and challenges of a career in ecology. The program will help train a new generation of scientists who are both prepared and motivated to translate ecological science to the public.  The program weaves together activities in 5 strands: 1) cutting edge independent research projects working closely with a mentor scientist, 2) linkages to policy and management through a Case Study of a local environmental issue, 3) linkages to the public where students learn to write short, easy-to-understand summaries of ecology research projects, 4) linkages to education where students teach younger students and participate in an Education Roundtable, and 5) reflective practice, training and integration. Students receive training in Ethics and Responsible Conduct of Research and in safety, and participate in a Forum on Translational Ecology that showcases examples of translational ecology in action, as well as a diversity of professional role models and careers. Student and mentor survey characterize student growth and inform program improvement. The post-program survey is coordinated with the REU common assessment tool. Alumni are surveyed to identify long-term impacts on participants' motivation and success in career development. The twelve-week program is open to undergraduate freshmen, sophomores, juniors or first semester seniors who are US citizens or permanent residents. Participants receive a stipend, a meal allowance, free housing, and assistance with travel to and from the program. More information is available on the web at http://www.caryinstitute.org/education/reu.html, or by contacting PI Alan R. Berkowitz (berkowitza@caryinstitute.org) or REU Coordinator Patty Zolnik (zolnikp@caryinstitute.org).",

The 2011-2015 program (Translational Ecology for the Undergraduate) was directed by Alan R. Berkowitz (PI), Emma Rosi-Marshall (co-PI), Stuart E.G. Findlay and Felicia Keesing with 18 mentors and 54 students participating. The intensive 12 week summer program immersed them in the highly interactive research environment. Working closely with mentor scientists (Figures 1, 2), students delineated a question, developed and implemented projects, analyzed data, and gave an oral presentation in a formal symposium. Students reflected on what it means to be a scientist, and learned about how ecology is translated through communication, application and education. Activities included discussions, seminars, field trips and a communications workshop (Figure 3), a Case Study of a local environmental issue, the Sharing Science program (Figure 4), and a full-day Forum on Translational Ecology.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #158155; font-size: 16px;\">The program contributed to the field of ecology, with 68 peer reviewed publications over 29 years (3 in 2011-2015, with several in preparation) plus 33 (61%) final papers from the 2011-2015 students for the on-line Undergraduate Ecology Research Reports (</span><a style=\"font-size: 16px;\" href=\"http://www.caryinstitute.org/publications/307\">http://www.caryinstitute.org/publications/307</a><span style=\"color: #158155; font-size: 16px;\">)).

The group of 54 students that participated was even more diverse, with 37% underrepresented minorities, 70% female and 65% from schools with limited research opportunities. Cary REU students have gone on to diverse post-undergraduate pursuits (Figure 5). We have information within 2 years for all but one of the 54 2011-2015 students; 23 (43%) were in graduate school or had completed an advanced degree at the time they responded to the survey with another 20+% intending to pursue graduate studies, and 79% were either in school or working in a science-related field.</p>\n<p>Alumni Survey responses from 2011-2015 students demonstrate the diversity and depth of impacts.</p>\n<p><em>It was very integral to my career path, broadening my perspective, research skills, and confidence in my abilities.
