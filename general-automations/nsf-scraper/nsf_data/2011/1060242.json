 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Teaming Engineering and Mathematics Students: Part 2 (TEAMS2)\" is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially needy students and continues to support these scholars through a variety of structures and programs. TEAMS2 is a continuation of a successful S-STEM program (TEAMS) that has provided scholarships to 58 students: 30% of these scholars are women, 31% are Hispanic, and 90% are still in the program (or have graduated and are currently working in a STEM industry). TEAMS2 builds on the successes of TEAMS while also adding content to the program based on an external evaluation and assessment of current and past scholars. Students from underrepresented groups are being especially targeted for this support in a region that is primarily rural and where most students are first-generation. Students are being targeted for participation in three departments: mechanical engineering, civil engineering and mathematics. The TEAMS2 project is well-integrated with a STEP program on campus and builds upon the natural cohort relationship that occurs among engineering and mathematics students within their twenty-four credit hours of required mathematics instruction. Students are being supported by project personnel who have special expertise in five areas: mentoring, academic counseling, career counseling, research/internships, and professional interactions.",
