  "por_txt_cntn": "\nI found that my time in New Zealand was a very valuable cultural experience.  I lived in Dunedin, which is on the South Island.  I rented a car for the duration of my stay and was able to travel all around the South Island.  I think that driving around the country is the best way to experience a new destination.  \n\nWhile all of my time during the week was spent in the lab, I wanted to maximize my experience so I tried to see as much as I could on the weekends.  I drove along the 225-mile stretch of coast between Christchurch and Dunedin, and I was actually in Christchurch for a gentle earthquake in July.  I went to two rugby games in Dunedin, one that featured the national team, the All Blacks.  I spent one weekend in Queenstown and went snowboarding and skiing.  One weekend I went to Fiordland National Park and drove the road between Te Anau and Milford Sound.  Another weekend I drove up the west coast of New Zealand and visited Franz Josef Glacier in addition to driving over the Southern Alps.  I took the short flight up to Auckland during another weekend and had the opportunity to explore the northern part of the North Island. \n\nIn addition to my own travels, the Royal Society orientation in Wellington also had an excellent array of cultural events that welcomed us to New Zealand.  The schedule of events for the New Zealand EAPSI fellows included:  a trip to the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, a guided tour of the Te Papa Tongorewa Museum of New Zealand and a tour of the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) Aquaculture Research Center.  In Washington D.C., we also had a reception at the New Zealand Embassy with Right Honorable Mike Moore, the current New Zealand Ambassador to the United States.\n\nThe University of Otago provided the opportunity to enhance my existing scientific understanding and familiarize myself with instrumentation and techniques not available at Florida Institute of Technology.  These included 59Co NMR spectroscopy, ESI-MS, microanalysis, ion-exchange chromatography and crystallography.  \n\nI have attached a few photographs that I took during my time in New Zealand.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron Funk"
