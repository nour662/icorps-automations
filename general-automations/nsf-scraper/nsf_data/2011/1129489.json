The interdisciplinary conference will draw together thinkers from a variety of disciplines and educational systems to identify directions for future study.  \r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project lies in creating a robust research network that crosses disciplinary boundaries and connects members of historically different communities.  The long-term results of the workshop and the research arising from it can have a potentially broad impact on how engineering is taught.",
