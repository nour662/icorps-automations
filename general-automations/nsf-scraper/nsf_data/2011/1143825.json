The summit is organized and sponsored by SDP Coordinating Group within the National Coordination Office (NCO) for Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD). The purpose of this summit is to inform a crosscutting SDP research and technology agenda. It will provide a forum for bringing together policy makers, stakeholders, visionaries, and R&D leaders for software design and productivity research. The summit will focus on the key issues of the SDP mission: to advance software engineering concepts, methods, techniques and tools that result in more usable, dependable, cost-effective, and sustainable software-intensive systems. This grant will reimburse academic participants for travel and accommodations.",
