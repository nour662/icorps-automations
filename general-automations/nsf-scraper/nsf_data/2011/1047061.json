 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the problem of\r\na shortage of pure drinkable water by developing a new portable water purification filter coated\r\nwith natural polymers. Initially the developed filters will be utilized for use in personal water\r\npurifiers, later expanding the development of the filter for use in municipal water purification\r\nsystems. The development of this green technology based water treatment system will result in a\r\nnovel water purifier that is inexpensive, fast acting, simple to use, disposable, easily used in\r\ndeveloping countries, and has minimal impact on the environment. Furthermore, there would be\r\nno formation of harmful disinfection by-products.\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are the provision of an inexpensive, all\r\nnatural portable water purification system that will provide good safe potable water, particularly\r\nin third world countries. At risk drinking water can contain a variety of pathogens that can\r\ninclude heavy metals, harmful bacteria, parasitic cysts, cryptosporidium organisms and viruses.\r\nThe best methods to date for removing these pathogens are UV irradiation, ozonation, and\r\nboiling/distillation, with each of these water purification techniques requiring energy and support\r\nsystems that are not readily available for remote areas and situations. Other more portable water\r\ntreatment methods are not as effective, inconvenient, subject to failures that many times cannot\r\nbe easily detected, and/or supply poor tasting water. Therefore, there is a great need for the\r\ndevelopment of water purifiers that contain natural polymeric coatings that remove and/or kill\r\ndiarrheal diseases-causing bacteria and can also remove heavy metals from water. The proposed\r\nall natural water purification system is intended to remove and/or neutralize all of these multiple\r\nwater impurity elements. An established water purification company will be a partner in this\r\nproject so as to expedite the commercialization of this developed technology into the\r\nmarketplace.",
