Thursday and Friday afternoons will be set aside for informal sessions where participants will be encouraged to give ten-minute presentations of their recent work or to discuss open problems. The proposed areas of coverage for this year's conference include Brownian motion, local times, Markov chains and processes, random structures and algorithms, particle systems, and stochastic analysis. \r\n\r\nSpecialized mathematical  meetings like this are very important.
