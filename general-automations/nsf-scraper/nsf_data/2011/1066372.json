 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this project is to develop methods to describe and control the level of congestion (e.g., customer waiting times and queue lengths)in multi-server stochastic queueing models with time-varying arrival rates. The models will also include the important features of customer abandonment, non-exponential service and patience distributions, and network structure. The research will focus on models in which the system alternates between periods of overloading and underloading, as seen when the sta\u00b1ng levels cannot be adjusted flexibly in response to rapidly changing arrival rates. This research focuses on approximating deterministic time-varying fluid models, yielding approximations for the time-dependent mean values of queue lengths and waiting times as a function of the model parameters and the initial conditions. Then the research will consider refined Gaussian approximations for the full probability distributions. The approximations will be substantiated by simulation experiments and stochastic process limits.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide the basis for new methods and tools to design and manage large-scale service systems, such as healthcare systems and customer contact centers, for which there is a recognized need for new methods to improve capacity planning and operational control. The models are also relevant for many other applications, e.g., web server farms processing web-page requests, public housing authorities providing apartments to low-income tenants and financial back offices processing loan applications. Successful results can contribute to better ways to select capacity levels in design decisions and better ways to select staffing levels and to route and schedule customers in operational decisions. Nonstandard methods for treating time-varying arrivals are especially important when service times are relatively long, as in healthcare.",

This project has developed new  theory and engineering methods to help improve the performance of service systems, such as healthcare systems and customer contact centers.  The new theory and methods make it possible to better design, manage and control the service systems, so that service can be provided more efficiently, with customers receiving higher quality service, more promptly, and at less cost.\n\nThese service systems typically can be modeled as queueing models, having stochastic arrival processes and random service times, aimed to capture the inevitable uncertainty about demand and the ability of the system to respond to it.  Analysis of the queueing models yields useful performance descriptions (e.g., the time-dependent throughput, utilization of the servers, probability of delay, expected delay, abandonment probability) as a function of the specified arrival and service processes, making it possible to make better design and management decisions Almost all research conducted under this grant has been devoted to the creation and analysis of stochastic queueing models, and the investigation of how to fit them to system data.\n\nIn addition to the unpredictable stochastic variability in the arrival and service processes, service systems typically have predictable deterministic arrival rates that vary significantly over time.  Unfortunately, standard queueing theory concerns the steady-state behavior of a stationary model and thus does not apply to the time-varying arrival rates.  The major focus of the completed research has been on queueing models with time-varying arrival rates.  The new approaches are especially important when service times are relatively long, as in healthcare. In some contexts (e.g., hospital emergency rooms and telephone call centers), it is also important that the new approaches apply when there is customer abandonment in the model, because it often occurs and because it significantly alters performance. In addition, the new approaches account for the fact that service often does not take place in a single queueing facility, but instead is provided in a network of queueing facilities.\n\nExploiting Large Scale:  Fluid and Diffusion Models. The scale of service systems has continued to grow, so that it is now common for a call center to have thousands of service representatives and a hospital to have thousands of beds.  This large scale tends to make detailed analysis with stochastic queueing models very difficult to carry out effectively. However, as illustrated by the completed research, the large scale often can be converted from a liability to an advantage, leading to more elementary macroscopic models, that parsimoniously capture the essential features of system performance. These deterministic fluid models and stochastic diffusion process models have relatively few parameters, so that they are more amenable to mathematical analysis.  \n\nMoreover, important support for the macroscopic models can be obtained by showing that these models arise as ``heavy-traffic'' limits of the conventional queueing models as the scale is allowed to increase, i.e., as the arrival rate and the number of servers are allowed to increase, while holding the service and patience time distributions fixed.  A first-order deterministic fluid model approximation arises in a ``heavy-traffic law of large numbers,'' while a refined second-order stochastic diffusion process approximation arises in an associated ``heavy-traffic central limit theorem.''  The fluid model can directly serve as an approximation for a very large service system, but for smaller service systems with relatively few servers the stochastic fluctuations about the mean values cannot be ignored.  Then the refined stochastic approximations, with mean values from the fluid model, become important.\n\nNew time-varying fluid and diffusion models for many-server queueing systems and supporting heavy-traffic limits were obt..."
