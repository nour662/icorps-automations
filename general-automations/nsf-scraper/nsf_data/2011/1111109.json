 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will exploit algebraic properties of operators associated with graphs in an integrated set of research and educational activities designed to develop new mathematical and algorithmic techniques; apply these to the solution of real-world problems and longstanding theoretical questions in mathematics, computer science, biology, and physics; and make these techniques broadly known and accessible to students, researchers, and practitioners in many fields.\r\n\r\nThis research has its origins in spectral graph theory, which studies how the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian (and other related matrices) interact with the combinatorial structure of the graph.  Spectral graph theory has been one of the great success stories in both the theory and practice of algorithm design. It has led to fundamental advances in graph partitioning, web search (notably including Google's PageRank algorithm), the understanding of random processes and the algorithms derived from them, the construction of error correcting codes, derandomization, convex optimization, machine learning, and many others.\r\n\r\nWhile the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian capture a striking amount of the structure of the graph, they certainly do not capture all of it.  Recent work by the principal investigators and other researchers suggests that theoretical computer scientists have only scratched the surface of what can be done if they are willing to broaden their investigation, extending it to study more general algebraic properties of the Laplacian than just its eigenvalue structure, and more general operators than just the Laplacian.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, the principal investigators will build a research program across the three universities involved in this proposal to develop such a theory and its applications. This initiative has the potential to provide transformative advances in a range of theoretical and applied areas of computer science, including:\r\n\r\n* Faster algorithms for fundamental graph problems, such as Maximum Flow, Minimum Cut, Minimum Cost Flow, Multicommodity Flow, approximating Sparsest Cut, generating random spanning trees, and constructing low-stretch spaning trees.\r\n\r\n* Better algorithms for the analysis of data, with potential applications to the Unique Games Conjecture.\r\n\r\n* Faster algorithms for solving broad classes of important linear systems, both sequentially and in parallel.\r\n\r\n* Faster distributed algorithms for information dissemination in networks.\r\n\r\n* A spectral and algebraic graph theory for directed graphs, based on ideas from differential geometry.\r\n\r\n* Novel quantum algorithms for a large class of problems that appear to be hard for classical computers.\r\n\r\n* New techniques for problems in Quantum Physics based on ideas developed in Computer Science and Combinatorics.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigators will also work to disseminate these techniques by developing courses, training undergraduate and graduate students, and introducing these ideas to scientists in other fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch funded by this grant resulted in new frameworks and faster algorithms for several fundamental problems in graph algorithms and optimization, in some cases breaking longstanding barriers that had stood for decades.  This included, among others:\n\nGraph algorithms\n\nWe designed the first algorithms whose running times scale nearly linearly in the size of the input for a variety of basic graph problems, including finding approximately optimal maximum flows, minimum s-t cuts, multicommodity flows, sparse cuts, and oblivious routings, as well as faster algorithms for generating uniformly random spanning trees.  These are among the most widely-studied problems in optimization, with applications that include transportation, machine learning, graph partitioning, clustering, scheduling, image segmentation, computational biology and network routing. \n\nMarkov chains and stationary distributions\n\nMarkov chains are a powerful abstraction for modeling systems whose behavior involves randomness, and they are ubiquitous in mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and the natural sciences.  The most basic property one can compute for a Markov chain is its stationary distribution, which captures the long-term evolution of the system.  One can describe the computation of the stationary distribution as a linear algebra problem, which enables one to compute them using general linear algebra routines.  However, the time to do this, in general, scales more than quadratically with the size of the problem, which drastically limits the size of the instances that one can realistically solve.  While stationary distributions have been extensively studied since the 1800s and have been an important computational primitive in many algorithmic settings, there was nothing known about how to exploit their structure and compute them more efficiently than by applying these general linear algebraic techniques.  \n\nBy developing new mathematical techniques in an area known as directed spectral graph theory, we showed that one can substantially improve upon these methods.  This resulted in an algorithm that can find the stationary distribution of a Markov chain in time that is close to linear in the instance size.  In addition, we showed how to use the same techniques to compute a wide range of other properties of random walks on directed graphs in almost linear time, including hitting times, escape probabilities, and personalized PageRank vectors. \n\nNumerical linear algebra\n\nWe developed faster algorithms for a variety of linear algebraic problems, including solving broad classes of linear systems, reducing high-dimensional problems to much lower-dimensional problems that can be solved much more efficiently, and rescaling matrices to improve their numerical properties. \n\nConvex optimization\n\nMany optimization problems arising in both theory and practice can be cast as what are known as \"convex programs.\" This is a very broad class of problems, yet there are general algorithms for solving any such problem reasonably efficiently without the need for specialized routines.  Research funded by this grant led to the most substantial asymptotic improvements in several decades for several of the most important classes of convex programs and optimization methods, including linear and semidefinite programming, cutting plane methods, and interior point methods.\n\n \n\nAwards and mentoring \n\nWork funded by this grant and performed by PI Kelner and students under his supervision won awards at the top venues in the field, including, among others. Best Paper Awards at  FOCS 2013, SODA 2014, and STOC 2014.\n\nThis grant has funded the professional development of students who have emerged as among the top researchers in the world.  Ph.D. students and/or postdoctoral researchers supervised by PI Kelner under these grants were involved in the work that won all of the awards listed above, as well Best Student Paper Awards at SODA 2013, FOCS 2015, and FOCS 2016, Sprowls Doctoral Dissertation Awards in 2013, 2015, and 2016, Honorable Mention for the ACM Dissertation Award in 2015, the ACM-EATCS Dissertation Award in Distributed Computing in 2013, and the A.W.
