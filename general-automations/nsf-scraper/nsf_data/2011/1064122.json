 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pharmaceutical innovation has had an important impact on human welfare across the globe.  It is important that public policymakers around the world get the policy balance between the competing goals of drug access and incentives for R&D right.  Since the U.S. pharmaceutical market has and will continue to play a disproportionately important role in global industry profits, it is especially important that U.S. policy strike the right balance.  The legislation that determines this balance in the United States is the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984.  It was originally hailed as a bipartisan compromise that both raised access and increased incentives for R&D.  In more recent years, it appears that the Act has opened the door to a greater degree of generic competition for drug innovators than its architects may have intended.  This research examines the impact of the acceleration of generic entry on consumer welfare,  the incentives for R&D investment, and the impact on innovation.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:  The research takes advantage of recent methodological advances in industrial organization and econometrics that assess the welfare impact of new product introductions.  The methodological tools are applied to a data set that is richer and more complete than that of prior investigators in this field.  In particular, the research makes use of the universe of product level sales data for pharmaceuticals marketed in the U.S. over a substantial period of recent time.  These data are linked to comprehensive data on expedited generic entry authorized under the Hatch-Waxman Act.  The researchers also trace product-level sales data at the firm level. This is linked with a comprehensive data base that covers effectively all new compounds entering the clinical trials process in the United States over the sample period. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts:  The research provides important insight into the gains that come with increased access against the losses that may accrue due to foregone or delayed innovation and provide increased understanding of whether the policy balance in the U.S. market is optimal one.  In addition, the research provides both a conceptual and empirical foundation for future research.",

Fuchs (1982) and Lichtenberg (2001, 2004, 2007) suggest that much of the improvement in health is due to humanity\u00c6s expanding pharmaceutical arsenal.  Anything that affects innovation in pharmaceuticals can have profound influence on global human welfare, especially in the longer run.  \nAmong the market drivers of pharmaceutical innovation, profits earned by drug companies in the U.S. market have played an especially important role, so public policy that affects the returns drug companies earn on their R&amp;D investments in the U.S. market can play a significant role in shaping the rate and direction of pharmaceutical innovation.  \nThe 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act sought to enhance access to inexpensive generic drugs while retaining appropriate incentives for drug companies to continue to invest in the development of new drugs.  The original provisions of this law, combined with subsequent changes in regulation, key court decisions, and supplemental legislation, have lead to a substantial increase in generic penetration in the U.S. market.  In recent years, it has become increasingly common for generic drugs to enter the market and compete with branded drugs even before the patents protecting those branded drugs expire.  The provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act that allows this early generic entry is referred to as \"Paragraph IV.\"\nOur work confirms the existence of significant increases in patient welfare associated with the acceleration of generic drug entry into pharmaceutical markets achieved via the \"Paragraph IV\" certification process.  We focus on the market for hypertension drugs in the United States, which has seen substantial Paragraph IV entry since the late 1990s.  The gains to consumers of these drugs from the price declines associated with generic entry are much greater than the losses born by producers, and we find total social gains of between $23 billion to $58 billion, depending on the econometric specification used. The gains across all the drug categories in which there has been Paragraph IV entry are likely to be extremely large.\nHowever, it is also possible that rising generic penetration has affected the incentives to conduct R&amp;D.  Many scholars have speculated about this possibility, but there has been little hard empirical evidence on the existence or magnitude of this effect.\nOur project quantifies a negative relationship between rising generic penetration in a pharmaceutical market and early stage drug development activity, as measured by the flow of new drug compounds under preclinical development and entering Phase I clinical trials.  This relationship is statistically and economically significant, suggesting that a 10% increase in generic prevalence leads to a 7.3% decline in new drug development.  However, the overall aggregate level of new drug development has not declined.  Instead, we find that rising generic penetration in a particular market appears to push chemistry-based drug development efforts elsewhere.  Furthermore, we find, within pharmaceutical markets subject to rising generic penetration, a strong tendency for the remaining drug development effort to rotate out of chemistry-based drugs and into biotechnology-based drugs, for which there are not yet well defined pathways for generic entry.  \nThe full implications of this shift for welfare are uncertain, but the possibility exists that research efforts are being concentrated in biotech not just because of the scientific opportunities there but also because biotech drugs..."
