 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to explore some applications and potential applications of algebraic topology and algebraic K-theory.  In algebraic K-theory, the project explores ideas applicable to the conjecture of Waldhausen on the K-theory chromatic tower, relating arithmetic and geometry.  The project explores a number of potential contributions to the theory and computation of topological Hochschild homology and topological cyclic homology. The project explores some new stable homotopy tools applicable to the study of the algebraic K-theory of spaces (which is closely related to the differential topology of high dimensional manifolds).  In unstable homotopy theory, the project explores the applications of homotopy algebras to computations related to fiber squares and mapping spaces.\r\n\r\nHomotopy theory studies those properties of mathematical objects that do not change under small deformations.  These mathematical objects are often of a geometric nature but the methods of homotopy theory have been increasingly applied to objects of an algebraic nature as well.  Homotopy theoretic properties tend to be accessible to computation by taking advantage of the invariance under small changes. Since they also generally retain important information about the original mathematical objects, homotopy theory is an effective tool for a wide range of mathematical problems.",

The most fundamental example of K-theory is the K-theory of the sphere spectrum.\nOne of the most important results of this project generalizes what is known about the algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum from regular primes to all primes. In particular, the paper \"The homotopy groups of the algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum\" calculates the K-groups of the sphere spectrum in terms of the homotopy groups of some more basic and more familiar objects plus the algebraic K-theory of the integers. The paper \"The nilpotence theorem for the algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum\" proves a completely new result about the K-theory of the sphere spectrum, namely that it satisfies a version of Nishida's nilpotence theorem: The multiplication on its homotopy groups is nilpotent outside of degree zero.\nAlgebraic K-theory is non-linear; its linearization is called \"topological Hochschild homology\" (THH). Much of what we know calculationally about algebraic K-theory has arisen by studying THH and a related theory called \"topological cyclic homology\" (TC). The papers \"Localization for THH(ku) and the topological Hochschild and cyclic homology of Waldhausen categories\", \"The homotopy theory of cyclotomic spectra\", and \"Relative cyclotomic spectra and topological cyclic homology via the norm\" contribute to the foundations of this subjec..."
