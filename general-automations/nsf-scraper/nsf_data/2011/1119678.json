 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is conducting a longitudinal study of the effects of an innovative pre-service elementary science education program at Western Washington University which was established with support from an NSF MSP grant. \r\n\r\nThere are four overlapping studies on the pre-service teachers (PSTs) and in-service teachers who are graduates of the program: (1) Comparing the pedagogical beliefs and skills of elementary PSTs as a function of the number (0-3) of reformed science content courses taken; (2) Comparing the same outcome variables for PSTs placed for student teaching with trained or untrained mentor teachers; (3) Comparing the impact of the science methods/practicum on PSTs who experienced the WWU reformed courses and those who did not; (4) An exploratory case study of the instructional practices of 20 novice elementary science teachers. The research utilizes the following existing instruments. (1) CLASS, the Colorado Learning Attitudes on Science Survey, (2) the Horizon Classroom Observation Protocol, (3) the Washington Educator Skills Test-Endorsement, and (4) the Washington State Science Assessment for 5th graders in addition to some instruments developed by the project.  Studies 1-3 will each have 45 treatment and 45 control participants. Evaluation is by Horizon Research Inc. It focuses on project progress and effectiveness, which is appropriate for a research project. Its participation will also facilitate the use of the Horizon Classroom Observation Protocol. \r\n\r\nThe new undergraduate program at WWU has implemented and institutionalized many of the recommendations for best practices in preparing elementary school teachers in science. This project is seeking to analyze the impact of three essential dimensions of teacher preparation: inquiry-based science content courses, science methods/practicum courses, and student teaching.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMORE for Teachers Outcome Report                                         \n\nStudies have shown the benefits of \"active learning\" (also called student-centered) science content courses on undergraduate students? science content knowledge (e.g., Freeman et al., 2014), but there is a paucity of research about the impacts of such courses on preservice teachers? beliefs and instructional practices.  Additionally, there is limited research on the impacts of active learning science methods courses on preservice teachers (PSTs).  Our research team from Western Washington University examined an elementary science teacher preparation at a mid-size, public higher education institution in the Pacific Northwest.  We found that PSTs who took a student-centered science content course compared to a \"traditional lecture/lab\" science content course began their science methods and practicum course sequence with significantly more sophisticated understandings of effective science instruction and taught significantly higher quality science lessons in their initial teaching experiences during their practicum course. \n\nThe participating university had multiple campuses that were geographically dispersed, and some PSTs took their elementary science methods/practicum sequence on a campus, where the hallmark of a good elementary science lesson was the \"hands-on\" aspect of the lesson, even if the lesson lacked clear learning targets or wasn?t part of a coherent sequence of lessons within an instructional unit.  Other PSTs took their elementary science methods/practicum sequence on a campus, where the hallmark of a good science lesson was the \"minds-on\" aspect of the lesson, where elementary students actively engaged in constructing their understanding of important concepts that built sequentially to big scientific ideas.  Compared to PSTs who took the elementary science methods/practicum sequence with a hands-on activity focus, PSTs who took the sequence grounded in cognitive learning theory significantly increased their ability to understand and recognize the quality of science lessons.\n\nThrough our research, we also learned that classroom teachers, who had practicum students teach science in their elementary classrooms for a quarter, had little or no training on how to mentor PSTs.  We identified the key knowledge and skills classroom teachers needed to effectively mentor novice teachers, including:  1) knowledge of research-based components of effective science instruction, 2) skills with mentoring stances and strategies, and 3) the ability to use observational and student data as evidence of student learning in mentoring conversations.

Teachers participated in three \"mentoring cycles\" over an 18-month period.  During each mentoring cycle, mentor teachers hosted a team of 2-3 elementary science practicum students who taught a FOSS science kit to their elementary students.  We structured the PD to lead the mentor teachers through a cycle of new learning, practice, and analysis of practice.

Furthermore, the elementary science practicum students who were mentored (n=73) showed statistically greater gains in their understanding of effective science instruction than their non-mentored peers (n=177).\n\nIn light of the significant impacts of the MORE for Teachers Mentoring PD, we developed a series of free, online mentoring modules to help K-16 teachers and administrators effectively mentor preservice teachers, novice teachers, or any teacher who wants to improve student learning in their classroom.  A pilot-test of the online modules found positive impacts on teachers? mentoring practices that aligned with the findings from our in-person mentoring PD.  The three online modules can be completed in one hour and feature engaging animations and authentic cases that highlight best practices in mentoring.\n\nYou can access the MORE for Teachers Mentoring Modules through the following websites:  \n\nCanvas:  https://wwu.instructure.com/courses/1261000\n\nYouTube:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3wWD0mP5Nawfm7jsfZ5PoGJxnV5cRF1N\n\nScreencast-O-Matic:  https://screencast-o-matic.com/channels/cFje30gQ4\n\nVimeo:  https://vimeo.com/channels/1394904\n\n \n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\n \n\nDan Hanley, Ph.D.\n\nDirector of Educational Research and Evaluation\n\nScience, Mathematics, &amp; Technology Education\n\nWestern Washington University\n\nPhone:  (360) 650-4683\n\nEmail:  Daniel.hanley@wwu.edu\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/18/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Hanley"
