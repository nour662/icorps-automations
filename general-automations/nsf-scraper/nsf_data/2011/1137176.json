Many of these observatories are funded, in whole or in part, by NSF. Recent technological increases in telescope and instrumental capabilities are enabling a rapid and very significant increase in the quality and quantity of digital astronomical data delivered by the observatories.  In recognition of this and the impact that the resultant data flow will have on Chile's broadband network infrastructure, a symposium is being held in Santiago, Chile where national and international experts along with representatives of Chilean government agencies will help develop the ideas for an advanced connectivity infrastructure that will serve not only NSF's investments but Chilean society as well.",
