 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Ruanbao Zhou\r\nProposal Number:  1133951\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nBiorefineries typically release about one third of the carbohydrate carbon as carbon dioxide (CO2) during fermentation. Ideally, a photosynthetic microorganism could be engineered to convert CO2 directly into liquid transportation fuels. Unfortunately, current approaches for using photosynthetic microorganisms to make fuel from CO2 suffer from many technical challenges, including the need to harvest cells, extract the energy-dense oils, and then convert the oil into the final product.  To address these challenges, the proposed research will genetically engineer two cyanobacteria (Anabaena sp. PCC7120 and Nostoc punctiforme) to directly produce and secrete linalool, a ten-carbon terpene alcohol, through the non melavonate (MEP) pathway using sunlight as the energy source and CO2 as the carbon feedstock.  To intensify linalool production, efforts will also be made to genetically engineer the cyanobacteria to increase the rate of photosynthetic CO2 fixation, and to re-direct the carbon flow to linalool synthesis by shutting unnecessary pathways that compete for fixed carbon.   Towards this end, the proposed research plan has three components: 1) stable insertion of optimal LinS gene into chromosome of cyanobacteria;  2) correct metabolic flux  to maximize linalool productivity; 3) assess linalool production under both photosynthetic and\r\nheterotrophic conditions.  The performance of the engineered strains will be assessed in a recirculating photobioreactor system that uses phase separation for linalool recovery. Linalool yield and productivity will be compared to input requirements.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe proposed education and outreach activities will focus on providing opportunities for Native American students through the 2+2+2 Program at the South Dakota State University (SDSU).  First, week-long activities in metabolic engineering will be developed as part of the summer institute program. Through these activities, Native American high school students and their teachers will be recruited to participate in 6-8 week long, summer research internships. Teachers will use the research experience to develop classroom/lab activities to share with their students.  Students will participate in on-going projects, and then will be given the opportunity to present their efforts at scientific meetings organized through the South Dakota Academy of Science and SDSU?s Undergraduate Research Day.  Native American undergraduate students who attend tribal colleges and then transfer to SDSU will also be offered summer research experiences.",

In plants, linalool is produced from the universal isoprenoid intermediate geranyl diphosphate (GPP) through the MEP pathway. &nbsp;Linalool has many commercial applications including perfumed hygiene products, flavor and fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and drop-in biofuels. Commercial production of linalool from plant extracts is limited by availability of raw feedstocks and high extraction costs. Engineering N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria to photosynthetically produce and secrete linalool may have potential to solve these two problems simultaneously.</p>\n<p>In summary, this project used synthetic biology to have developed N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria that can directly convert solar energy, CO<sub>2</sub> and water into a fragrant linalool. The linalool produced by the engineered cyanobacterium was secreted into the media and volatilized into the flask headspace, allowing for easy separation of linalool from the culture biomass. Thus, the engineered N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacterium can serve as a living cellular factory, &ldquo;Cyanofactory&rdquo; (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>) to continuously produce and emit a wide range of commodity chemicals/fuels using only atmospheric gases (CO<sub>2</sub> &amp; N<sub>2</sub>), mineralized H<sub>2</sub>O, and sunlight. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unlike plants, N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria are capable of performing both solar-powered N<sub>2</sub>-fixation and CO<sub>2</sub>-fixation. Their simple input requirements for rapid growth and ease of genetic manipulation, together with the highest photosynthetic efficiency and suitability for industrialized production, N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria are attractive organisms for engineering production of linalool. Cyanobacteria, like plants, have native metabolic pathways (Calvin cycle and MEP pathway) to photosynthetically convert CO<sub>2</sub> and water into a variety of reduced carbon compounds, including GPP, the precursor for linalool. However, cyanobacteria lack the linalool synthase that plants use to convert GPP into linalool. In this research, we have created three generations of linalool-producing cyanobacteria. First, a linalool synthase gene from <em>Norway Spruce</em> was fused to a synthetic, dual cyanobacterial <em>P<sub>nir</sub>&ndash;P<sub>psbA1</sub></em> promoter and subcloned into a shuttle vector for transformation of an N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacterium <em>Anabaena sp. </em>PCC7120<em>.</em> <strong>The first generation </strong>of transgenic <em>Anabaena</em> (with a single plant linalool synthase gene) was confirmed to continuously synthesize and secrete linalool using only air (CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> gas), mineralized water and light energy. To increase linalool production<strong>,</strong> a synthetic operon coding for three key enzymes (DXS-IDI-GPPS) from the MEP pathway were over-expressed in <em>Anabaena</em>. <strong>This second generation </strong>strain produced 2.8 fold more linalool than the first generation strain. Under 50 &micro;E&middot;m<sup>-2</sup>&middot;s<sup>-1</sup> illumination, the maximum linalool productivity was 35mg/L/day/OD<sub>720</sub> when nitrate was used as the sole nitrogen source, and 36.1mg/L/day/OD<sub>720</sub> when atmospheric &nbsp;N<sub>2</sub> gas was the sole nitrogen source. To further increase linalool production, we created a <strong>third generation</strong> of the linalool-producing <em>Anabaena</em> by introducing a synthetic CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing photorespiratory bypass that is based on the 3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle (3-HP-bicycle). This synthetic photorespiratory bypass pathway (containing six enzymes) is expected to avoid the loss of fixed carbon during photorespiration, and also functions as an additional O<sub>2</sub>-tolerant, CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing pathway, alongside the Calvin cycle. The third generation strain showed a maximum productivity of 133.7&micro;g/L/day/OD<sub>720</sub> when the culture was bubbled with air (200ml/min),<sub> </sub>producing about10.7-fold more linalool than the first generation strain.</p>\n<p><strong>Key outcomes:</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 papers have been published in peer-reviewed journals</p>\n<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One US patent was granted</p>\n<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project has trained six visiting scientists, six graduate students (two earned Ph.D., two earned M.S. degree).</p>\n<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Impressively, there were 33 undergraduate student received extensive trainings in molecular biology of cyanobacteria.
