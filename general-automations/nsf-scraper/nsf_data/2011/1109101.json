There are three last speakers of this under-documented language who are in their nineties and in frail health. The outcomes of this project are pivotal to understanding the typological features which characterize the Zaparo language family. The project records conversational interactions and oral narratives from which a corpus will be constructed with interlinearalized transcriptions. The project will be valuable to researchers and to community members as the final products include the central corpus (in video and audio formats), a Zaparo-Spanish-Quichua Dictionary and a Zaparo primer.",
