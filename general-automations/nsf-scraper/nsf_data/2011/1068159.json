 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific research in this project is directed towards the interface between atomic and condensed matter physics.  A particular focus is quantum optics in high-density and ultra cold atomic gases, in which disorder-driven electromagnetic interactions can develop strongly correlated character, typified by Anderson localization of light and the onset of random lasing.   The overriding theme of the research program is investigation of the physics of strongly correlated atomic-radiative systems, including phase transitions in ultracold atomic vapor. A closely related secondary theme appears when such systems are electromagnetically dressed by an external field. Then new phenomena, including formation of a diffusive dark state quasiparticle, are expected to emerge.  \r\n\r\nThis fundamental research project focuses on manifestations of localization of electromagnetic waves in ultracold gases.  As individual photons are noninteracting bosons, a nearly idealized system can be realized with a spatially disordered gas of atomic scatterers. Measurement of the time evolution of light emerging from a sufficiently dense sample provides strong measures of the development of localized states.  These include a departure from diffusive light transport at a characteristic localization time, the temporal evolution of the light intensity for times larger than the localization time, and the appearance of critical fluctuations in the vicinity of the localization transition.  These quantities are analyzed by time-dependent models of localization, and by atomic models of light localization, to obtain critical exponents and parameters characterizing the localization transition.  The role of interactions among the scatterers, as induced by the localized field itself, forms an essential focus area of the research.  A second general area, coherent control of weak light localization, is also being pursued.  In these studies, a spatially disordered atomic gas is dressed with a strong control field, modifying the localization of a multiply scattered, weak probe beam.  Among other applications, this serves as a measure of the fidelity of single photon storage and retrieval, and can have an important impact on an array of problems in quantum linear and nonlinear optics and quantum information.    \r\n\r\nOverall, this research project has significant potential scientific and technical impact in a wide range of basic and practical areas, these associated with the inevitable presence of disorder in realistic systems.  These include quantum phase transitions, deeper understanding of the role of gain and the development of random lasing in disordered systems, and new mechanisms for quantum light storage in quantum information science.   Beyond these more technical aspects, the research program also has significant impact on science education, infrastructure, and diversity. This is partly accomplished by substantially involving undergraduate and graduate students in all parts of the research projects, including attendance at undergraduate-focused symposia at professional conferences. Students participate in undergraduate (independent study and Senior Thesis research) and M.S. Thesis study associated with the experiments.  In the past decade, 14 Ph.D. and many M.S. students, nearly half of whom are women, have been involved in our research projects.  Through active recruitment of talented undergraduates, paid internships, and our previous track record, we expect that pattern to continue.  Most graduated students have gone on to technical industrial positions, while the remainder are involved in science education at all levels. Finally, the research impacts international science education and infrastructure through involvement of Ph.D. students and faculty in international components of this research with academic colleagues and students in Russia and France.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe merging of quantum optics and cold atom physics has revolutionized several areas of scientific and technical development.  Quantum optics is the field of study of light quanta,  photons, and their interaction with matter.   Cold atom physics is just what it says, the investigation of cold atoms and their interaction with light and with other matter.  Atoms can be cooled to as low a temperature as about 50 picokelvin, a thrillionth of a degree above absolute zero.  For comparison, the cold near vacuum of outer space is a scorching 3 degrees Kelvin.  These joined scientific areas have led to new, and far improved, precision atomic clocks, the development of new sensors of magnetic and electric fields and magnetic field gradients, measurements of gravitational forces, and rotational motion, to name a few.  At the same time, entirely new areas of study have been developed, including quantum simulations of subtle effects in condensed matter and plasma physics, and the vast but yet new and dynamic area of quantum information and quantum communications.  \n\nThis project has made contributions to and impacted several technical and scientific research areas.  Earlier technical developments in generation and control of high density and cold atomic gases have been extended, and applied in several particular areas of quantum optics.   These advances were made in our capability to form and control cold atom ensembles under the proper conditions to study several emergent physical effects.  Here emergence is meant to mean physical phenomena that are not apparent or contained in the microscopic constituents of a system, but that appear as a whole when the constituent particles collaborate to form a larger system.  An example of an emergent effect in quantum optics is superradiance, in which individual particles (as antennas broadcasting light) synchronize to radiate much faster and with greater intensity than the individual atoms as independent objects.   Among those emergent effects researched in this project are: (a) disorder effects such as random lasing and Anderson localization of light, (b) cooperative and collective interactions of cold matter and light, and (c) frequencydependent microlasing and other novel optical effects.   Among other things, these studies may lead to a novel kind of memory for quantum memory for photons based on superradiant and subradiant states. \n\nSignificant contributions to scientific and technological human resources were also made, in that three graduate students and nine undergraduate researchers have gained substantial training and research experience through their involvement with this project.  The undergraduate students are still furthering their scientific and technical studies.  Former graduate students who did their doctoral research on the development of this project have worked  in areas not directly related to atomic physics (Accelerator Physics and Medical Physics).  One is teaching a STEM based curriculum in a secondary school, and the other now has a permanent position as a radiation and imaging specialist at a major medical research facility.    \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/15/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark D Havey"
