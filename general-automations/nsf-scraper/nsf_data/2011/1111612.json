The award will provide partial support for US participants, principally graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty. \r\n\r\nThe fluid-structure interaction problems arise in a variety of important applications in materials science, biological flows, and multi-phase flows among others. The workshop includes plenary lectures by international speakers on topics of current research interest in the area of fluid-structure interactions, including modeling and analysis, the related theory and analysis of partial differential equations, various numerical methods, and applications. It will provide a venue for the discussion of important recent advances and the current directions of research. The workshop encourages presentations by junior participants. It will serve to expose new research opportunities to young researchers and graduate students, and to facilitate the scientific collaborations between US scientists and their international counterpart. NCTS will support most of the expenses and logistics of the workshop.\r\n\r\nWorkshop web site: http://math.cts.nthu.edu.tw/Mathematics/FSIP2011.htm",
