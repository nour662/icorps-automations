 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematics and Physical Science (MAPS) Scholars Program at the University of California - Merced is providing a total of 52 two-year scholarships ($5,000 each per year) for academically talented, but financially needy, freshmen majoring in applied mathematics, physics, or chemistry over the duration of the award. The primary goals of this program are to increase the diversity of incoming applied mathematics, physics, and chemistry students and to increase the retention rate of students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. The specific project objectives that reflect this goal are to: 1) increase the overall retention rate of students in STEM fields while they are completing challenging lower division courses, 2) provide broad opportunities for MAPS Scholars while they are receiving a high quality university education, 3) help all scholarship recipients gain leadership skills and greater confidence in their academic abilities, and 4) increase the technical skills of graduating students to better prepare MAPS Scholars for careers in STEM fields. This program increases the participation and retention of underrepresented groups in STEM fields by providing on-going and comprehensive program specific academic and personal support in the form of faculty mentoring, academic advising and tutoring, seminars, leadership development, internship opportunities, a study skills course, and a study area accessible only to MAPS Scholars. These enhancement activities enable an ongoing community of MAPS Scholars, and they encourage the development of \"cohorts\" to support and reinforce learning experiences. The program also creates opportunities to build links between faculty at UC Merced and high schools of the San Joaquin Valley in order to increase interest among high schools students in the many educational opportunities of STEM fields.",
