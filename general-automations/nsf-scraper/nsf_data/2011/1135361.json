The organizing committee has selected three members of the learning sciences community to mentor advanced graduate students and pre-tenure faculty from this community, to help them focus on taking a theory-based approach to designing potentially-high-impact learning technologies.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this early-career workshop are (i) mentoring of advanced doctoral students into the social/professional network as partners in idea-making, (ii) supporting advanced doctoral students and early career faculty in developing viable technology-oriented research agendas, (iii) providing specific feedback and guidance to advanced doctoral students and early career faculty about their research agendas, and (iv) further developing a community of researchers interested in ways technology can transform teaching and learning.",
