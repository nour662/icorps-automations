 "awd_abstract_narration": "My research deals with mathematical problems involving gravity which arise in astrophysics. Specifically my research will involve (1) proving decay of solutions to the initial-value problem for Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism and for gravitational waves, both in a Kerr rotating black hole geometry; (2) studying shock waves and expansion waves arising in general relativity; (3) magnetic rotating and non-rotating Newtonian stars. Part 1 continues previous work on decay results for the Dirac and scalar wave equations, to Maxwell's equations and to the linearized Einstein equations in a KBH background geometry. Part 2 deals with shock waves and expansion waves in general relativity, and applying these wave solutions to problems in astrophysics; e.g. the so-called anomalous acceleration of the universe, without needing dark energy or the cosmological constant. It is based on my rigorously obtained new solutions of the Einstein equations. Part 3 arises from my recent results on existence and stability results for rotating Newtonian stars and is aimed at extending these results to magnetic stars (like our sun). This study is motivated by an attempt to better understand sunspots and solar flares, from a rigorous mathematical point of view.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is focused on three areas of astrophysics. The first involves studying whether black holes are stable under electromagnetic and gravitational perturbation. That is, if one sends an electromagnetic or gravitational wave into a rotating black hole, will the black hole remain pretty much intact, or will it radiate away a good portion of its energy? The second is to continue my work on new solutions of Einstein's equations explaining the so-called anomalous acceleration of the universe. That is, the standard physical model modifies Einstein's equations in an ad hoc manner and involves the notion of \"dark energy\", an unobserved anti-gravitational force, in order to agree with astronomical observations. This approach has no physical basis whatsoever. The final area of interest to me is to study start with magnetic fields with an aim to getting a theoretical explanation of sunspots and solar flares. These phenomena remain highly mysterious, and are important since when they occur, they disrupt satellite as well as radio communication. It is not known how to predict sunspots and solar flares, and a firm mathematical understanding of the associated equations would be an important step in this direction.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFinal NSF Report\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    First, together with Felix Finster, (University of Regensburg), we proved that a rotating Black Hole is linearly stable under small perturbations.  This was an open problem since the 1960?s when Roy Kerr proved the existence of a rotating  (Kerr), black hole.  As was generally recognized, this was \"one of the few truly outstanding problems that remained in the field of black hole perturbations\".  \n\n   For the stability problem, one considers the problem for initial data which is close to the Kerr solution, in a suitable weighted Sobelov space, and the question is whether the resulting solution settles down to the Kerr solution for large times.  Due to the non-linearity of the Einstein equations, this problem is very difficult. As a first step in this direction, one can linearize the equations around a Kerr solution, and analyze the behavior of the resulting wave equations.  This problem is referred to as the linear stability  of the Kerr black hole. \n\n   The problem of linear stability of black holes can be stated mathematically as the question of whether massless wave equations in the Kerr geometry decay in time.  The different types of equations are characterized systematically by their spin, taking values s=0,1/2,1, 3/2, 2,&hellip;  From the physical point of view, the most interesting cases are s=1 (Maxwell field), and s=2 (gravitational waves).  A general framework for analyzing the equations of arbitrary spin in the Kerr geometry is due to Teukolsky, who showed that the massless equations of any spin can be rewritten as a single wave equation for a complex scalar field.  We solved this problem for any spin, using the separation of the Teukolsky wave equation into a radial and angular equation, where the angular equation is an elliptic equation with complex coefficients.  Thus its spectrum is not real, and can be anywhere in the complex plane.  Locating the spectrum is one of the major difficulties in our work, and makes use of several earlier papers that we have written earlier.\n\n \n\n   The second problem was done jointly with Blake Temple (Univ of California, Davis), and concerns the so-called anomalous acceleration of the universe.  The problem goes back to the late 1990?s when astronomers, observing supernova explosions, stated that the universe was accelerating.  As an explanation for this phenomenon, astrophysicists modified Einstein?s equations by adding an extra term to the equations (the cosmological constant), which was interpreted as  giving rise to \"Dark Energy\" and this dark energy caused the anomalous acceleration of the universe.  Dark energy has never been observed.  In contrast, Temple and I discovered a class of solutions in the radiation phase of the universe (about 800,000) years after the Big-Bang, and using these solutions we showed that the Standard Model of Cosmology is unstable.  This instability, in turn, gives rise to the anomalous acceleration.  Our framework uses the original Einstein field equations and we do not need either a cosmological constant nor the concept of Dark Energy.  Our theory gives precisely the range of red-shift vs. luminosity observed by astronomers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joel A Smoller"
