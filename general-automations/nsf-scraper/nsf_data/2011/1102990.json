 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cincinnati Engineering Enhanced Mathematics and Science Program (CEEMS) is led by the University of Cincinnati as the higher education Core Partner in Partnership with fourteen Core Partner school districts: Cincinnati Public Schools, Oak Hills, Princeton, Norwood, Winton Woods, and a Rural STEM Consortium of nine school districts. CEEMS works to meet the growing need for engineering-educated teachers who are equipped to provide learners with opportunities to achieve recently revised Ohio State Science Standards juxtaposed with Universal Skills (21st Century Learning Skills). These standards are centered in \"real world application: connections to engineering.\" To address this local, regional, state, and evolving national need, CEEMS offers four professional development pathways to teacher preparedness: 1. Masters in Curriculum and Instruction (CI) degree with Engineering Education (MCIEE) specialization; 2. Summer Institute for Teachers (SIT); 3. Education Pathway with Licensure for Engineering (EPLE) majors; and 4. Engineering Education Pathway for Career Changers (EEPCC).\r\n\r\nThe key to these pathways are eight new courses focusing on engineering and science content, and design and challenge-based pedagogy. Leveraging these courses in combination with existing Course and Curriculum Master's of Education pedagogical courses, CEEMS develops and deploys two pathways for in-service teachers (MICEE degree and SIT with certificate) and three pathways for pre-service teachers (MICEE degree with licensure, dual undergraduate engineering degree with teaching licensure, and teaching licensure for professionals with a STEM undergraduate degree). Preparation of SIT participants allows them to (1) integrate the materials into the courses they teach and (2) disseminate and provide professional development to their colleagues through a district-level \"teacher leaders\" dissemination program and a regional annual STEM education conference. With this tiered approach, CEEMS is reaching a total of 1,925 teachers (160 pre-service and 1,765 in-service) over five years. These teachers are impacting more than 38,500 7-12 grade students per year.\r\n\r\nThe  five implementation goals of this engineering-based CEEMS MSP are to: (1) Improve 7-12 student science and mathematics achievement to prepare for and increase interest in the college study of engineering or other STEM careers; (2) Develop mathematics and science teacher knowledge of engineering and the engineering design and challenge-based instruction process through explicit training and classroom implementation support; (3) Recruit engineering undergraduates as science or mathematics teachers through involvement in teaching experiences with younger college students in the schools and through a succinct licensure program; (4) Recruit career changers to science or mathematics teaching through succinct licensure programs; and (5) Build a collaborative sustainable education licensure STEM degree-granting infrastructure positively impacting the entire region.\r\n\r\nCEEMS is firmly rooted in current research in the fields of science, mathematics and engineering education. It affords a much-needed opportunity to study how students learn mathematics and science if engineering is used as the context.   \r\n\r\nThe CEEMS research effort uses a mixed method design to respond to the following questions: (1) How do students in a design and challenge-based learning environment engage in decision making, strategic planning, evaluation and revision of plans, creative thinking, and task persistence? (2) How do students in design and challenge-based learning environments perceive their involvement in STEM careers? (3) What measures and instruments are most effective at capturing and documenting these learning tasks? (4) How are the teachers' gains in knowledge of engineering transferred into instructional plans? (5) What supports and barriers do teachers encounter as they implement their plans with students? and (6) How do the knowledge gains and implementation factors impact the teachers' pedagogical content knowledge?",

The CEEMS secondary math and science units can be found at http://www.ceas3.uc.edu/ceems/.  These teachers impacted more than 18,080 6-12 grade students. Of the 88 CEEMS teachers, 32 enrolled in and 21 have completed the MICEE degree program as of August 2018.\n\nFor broader impacts, multiple sustainability methods have resulted in: 1) a book being published by the NSTA Press entitled, \"Energize Your Classroom With Engineering Design Challenges: Science and Math Teachers Share Their Experiences\" (ISBN: 978-1-68140-698-5), 2) converting a set of SIT courses to online graduate courses that earns the 12-credit GSEEC, which has been completed by 9 partial paying in-service teachers in August 2018; 3) STEMucation Academy, an online version of CEEMS where customers earn contact hours or course credits and a virtual coach guides a teacher to develop, teach and document a full CBL-EDP unit, and 1- and 3-day workshop for teachers; and 4) an Annual STEM Conference which is jointly hosted by the University of Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky University and the Greater Cincinnati STEM Collaborative and has had an average yearly attendance of over 300 teachers and administrators over the past 6 years.\n\nThe CEEMS evaluation and research studies used a mixed methods design to respond to the following questions: 1) How do students in a design and challenge-based learning environment engage in decision making, strategic planning, evaluation revision of plans, creative thinking, and task persistence? 2) How do students in design and challenge based learning environments perceive their involvement in STEM careers? 3) What measures and instruments are most effective at capturing and documenting these leaning tasks? 4) How are the teachers? gains in knowledge of engineering transferred into instructional plans? 5) What supports and barriers do teachers encounter as they implement their plans with students? and 6) How do the knowledge gains and implementation factors impact the teachers? pedagogical content knowledge?\n\nThe key findings from externally conducted evaluations include: 1) student interest in engineering is increasing; 2) students are learning the engineering design process, and their content knowledge gains are increasing; 3) teachers are using CEEMS-promoted instructional practices which has remained steady for up to two years after participation; 4) teachers use a wider variety of instructional practices; 5) teachers utilize their network of CEEMS teachers and Resource Team Members (RTM); 6) the RTM developing a collaborative coaching network allowing shared learning; and 7) the RTM developing coaching strategies to support teachers.\n\nThe key findings from a separate research study are: 1) teachers? increased knowledge of the engineering design process; 2) teacher instruction became more intentional, exemplified by the increased use of scaffolding activities and handouts to prepare and support students with the design process and content learning; and 3) the reduction of barriers when implementation of engineering design lessons over the course of the project\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anant R Kukreti"
