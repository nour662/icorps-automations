 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project includes a very large variety of activities designed to recruit and retain women STEM faculty at Oakland University (OU) with a four-pronged approach.  The first prong involves a thorough campus analysis and planning based on the analysis.  The second prong will focus on recruitment and hiring practices at OU with training for all search and department chairs, implicit bias training for Deans, increased transparency of applicant pools, the dissemination of family-friendly information, and the development of a dual career hiring policy.  The third prong of the project involves faculty retention and professional development initiatives including new faculty orientation, a mentoring program, and professional development workshops.  The fourth and final prong of the proposal includes initiatives surrounding dissemination, especially to the region?s 4-year and 2-year institutions.   \r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\r\n\r\nThe proposed initiatives are based on highly successful ADVANCE programs and tailored to the environment at OU.  The first-year information gathering will provide a strong foundation for the activities that will follow.  The scope of the activities is sweeping and the PI team is well qualified and well positioned to carry out the plans.  In addition they have enthusiastic letters of support from stakeholders across the campus including the Provost, Deans, Chairs, potential mentors, advisory board members, and the Union.  The proposal is well written and organized.   \r\n\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS\r\n\r\nThe sweeping scope of the proposed initiatives suggests a path to institutional transformation at a smaller, highly-motivated, primarily undergraduate institution.  The proposed dissemination to the regional 2 and 4 year institutions is also an innovative way to have broader impacts.  Although not a major focus of the project, the application and tailoring of programming to women of color adds some broader impact.",
