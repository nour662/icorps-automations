 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve the communication, teaching and leadership skills of graduate students conducting research in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) via teaching and mentoring in 7-12 secondary education, while advancing their research through the planned inquiry-based educational activities. The graduate fellows selected from multidisciplinary engineering disciplines will partner with teachers in planning, preparing and delivering CPS related enhancements to existing science and technology course topics, hence infusing CPS related basic engineering concepts into grades 7-12. Fellows will partner with selected teachers of technology, science, and math, and will act as role models and in-class ?resource persons?, while also mentoring students in various engineering and computational aspects of Alaska relevant CPS applications and projects. The educational activities and projects will be directly related to the fellows? CPS research, such as autonomous unmanned ground and aerial vehicles for exploration and search & rescue in the Arctic, internet-based bilateral control and teleoperation systems; sensor/actuator networks for decision support systems and for energy efficient automated buildings.\r\n\r\nCYBER-Alaska will address this need and provide systematic mentorship for engineering education with different applications of CPS, a theme identified as the technology of 21st century and a top priority for the USA. Our project will contribute to the education and training of well-rounded graduate students in this emerging area, while also addressing the urgent technical educational needs of Alaska public teachers and students, primarily aiming for rural schools and schools with high percentage of minorities and Alaskan natives.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCYBER-Alaska is designed to bring robotics into high school classrooms with a focus on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), which include a close interplay between their physical components and digital components.  We built interactive, network-connected robot systems including air and ground robots, and built software to allow high school students to program these robots to complete tasks.\n\nOur goal was to create increased motivation and learning of science and emerging CPS technologies among pre-college students and teachers via delivery of classroom teaching by grad students, also called ?graduate fellows? supported by related hands-on small projects and course modules (also developed by the fellows) that could convey the essential concepts of CPS.\n\nWe used multi-level mentoring, stretching from PhD level tenured faculty to middle school level students.  This gave us the technical depth we needed to build real robotics systems, while keeping us focused on applying the technology to real-world problems.\n\nOver 200 high school students and 3 teachers gained significant training in CS and CPS concepts over the life of the project.  This project has produced opportunities for five graduate and more than ten undergraduate students from UAF to be given in-depth and broad interdisciplinary training with this grant. \n\nThe grant stretched from 2011 to 2018, and the closing years included an international collaboration with the Istanbul Technical University to help develop remotely accessible testbeds, to allow multi-robot systems to be accessed over slow network connections.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/26/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Orion S Lawlor"
