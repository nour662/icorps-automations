 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to defray expenses of US participants (primarily junior mathematicians) to attend two workshops (February 14 - 25 and April 11-21) of the Bialgebras in Free Probability program at the Schroedinger Institute in Vienna in 2011.\r\n\r\nFree probability is a highly noncommutative probability theory with models in operator algebras, random matrices and combinatorics. The program will benefit from a large spectrum of experts (from operator algebras, combinatorics, random matrices, classical probability and mathematical physics) to examine the various sides of recent developments in free probability with a special emphasis on the recent occurrence of several kinds of bialgebra structures at a fundamental level in the subject. The first workshop period will be devoted to combinatorial, bialgebra and analytic aspects, while the second workshop period will be mostly about the operator algebra, random matrix and applications to mathematical physics aspects of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe award provides potential for great cross-fertilization between these areas of mathematics and at the same time a very good opportunity for young mathematicians (starting with graduate students and postdocs) with research interests in these areas.",
