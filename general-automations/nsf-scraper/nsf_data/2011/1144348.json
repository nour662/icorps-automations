This year's school, planned for August 28-September 9, 2011, offers a list of very distinguished lectures and lecturers.\r\nThe main program will consist of five minicourses with the following (confirmed) speakers and (tentative) titles:\r\n Michael Aizenman (Princeton) and Simone Warzel (Munich): Quantum spectra and dynamics under random potential\r\n Benjamin Schlein (Bonn): Spectral properties of Wigner matrices\r\n Herbert Spohn (Munich): Growth processes, directed polymers, and the 1D Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation\r\n Daniel Ueltschi (Warwick): Quantum Heisenberg models and their probabilistic representations\r\n Balint Toth (Budapest): Scaling limits of self-interacting walks and diffusions with long memory\r\nThe topic of this year's Tutorial Program is probability theory and mass transportation. The leader of the Tutorial Program is:\r\nTheodor Sturm (Bonn University)\r\n\r\n \r\nThe support is requested for 10 US graduate students.",
