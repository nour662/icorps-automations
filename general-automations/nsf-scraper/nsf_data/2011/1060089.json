 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is increasing the number of students graduating in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields and better preparing these graduates for their careers or graduate school. The objectives of the project are to:\r\n\r\n(1) Increase the number of well-educated and skilled employees in technical areas of national need by encouraging exploration of graduate level study and/or improving professional development and job seeking skills. Activities include career counseling, internships, conferences, graduate school fairs, and research opportunities. Workshops are being provided that address topics such as exploring scholarships and fellowships, applying to graduate school, and preparing for the GRE. As a result of these activities, 92% of S-STEM program graduates enroll in graduate school or find employment within their field.\r\n\r\n(2) Improve educational opportunities for students pursuing a baccalaureate degree in science, technology, or mathematics, with a special emphasis on talented but financially-disadvantaged students. The program is designed to support 20 participants during each year of the four-year project period. Program applicants are required to have a GPA of 3.0 or greater and must be formally accepted into one of the following programs: Computer Science, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, or Biochemistry.\r\n\r\n(3) Maintain 100% retention rates and degree attainment among S-STEM program participants. Activities related to this objective include faculty mentoring, tutoring, and cohort gatherings.\r\n\r\n(4) Strengthen the partnership between the college and employers and between the college and regional graduate schools and professional organizations in the fields of science, technology, and mathematics. By coordinating with local businesses and professional organizations, students can explore STEM-related career opportunities. Students are also provided opportunities to explore graduate schools of interest.\r\n\r\n(5) Maintain strong student support programs at the college and integrate the S-STEM objectives with pre-existing student support programs. As a result, 100% of S-STEM program participants obtain a baccalaureate degree in a STEM field.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project advances knowledge and understanding in the STEM fields by diversifying the pool of young graduates and ensuring that they are well prepared for the next step in their careers. The qualifications of the leadership team are reflected in the 100% retention rate of CSEMS/S-STEM participants during the past nine years. The combination of activities and services represents a unique and comprehensive program that is necessary to meet the needs of the target population. The project is designed to encourage active learning, and participants have access to a wide range of laboratory equipment, services, technology, and faculty support.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The college has a long history of providing educational opportunities for underserved populations. The S-STEM project fits into efforts at the college to increase undergraduate student research and internship opportunities and services the needs of the high technology workplace with well-prepared, but traditionally underserved, young adults.",
