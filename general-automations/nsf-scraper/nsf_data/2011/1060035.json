 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to recruit 102 academically talented, financially needy students to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs at the college. By providing scholarships and a continuum of support services the project seeks to increase retention and assist graduates in transitioning to further education or employment at one of the private sector companies, military installations, and government agencies in the region. Targeted programs include Applied Sciences and Technology, Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Computer Information Systems, Computer Science, Engineering, Engineering Technology, Environmental Technology, Information Services Technology, Information Systems Security, and Mathematics and Physical Sciences. \r\n\r\nProject objectives include:  \r\n(a) increasing enrollments by capitalizing on extensive K-16 STEM activity in the region;\r\n(b) increasing student retention through community building, weekly cohort contact, mentoring, tutoring, and enrichment experiences;  \r\n(c) expanding and streamlining articulation to facilitate transfer to four-year institutions; and engaging employers in recruiting, mentoring, and \r\n(d) providing work-based enrichment experiences for students.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project is introducing a customized, one-credit College Success Skills course as the vehicle for shaping students from diverse STEM disciplines who attend programs on three different campuses into small learning communities. The approach uses lessons learned from improving retention and academic performance by student athletes. By bringing students together over four semesters, offering them shared enrichment experiences, and providing mentors from both academia and the employment communities, the initiative is demonstrating a replicable approach for increasing success within STEM populations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project is increasing the number of academically talented, financially needy students, many of whom are first-generation college-goers, who have the opportunity for advanced careers. In an institution where females comprise 63% of the student body, and nearly half the full-time science majors are minorities, significant numbers of participants are expected to be from groups typically underrepresented in STEM careers. Outcomes for varied student population groups are being tracked and disseminated via the project website, presentations, and/or scholarly articles.",

Targeted programs include Applied Sciences and Technology, Biological Sciences, Computer Information Systems, Computer Science, Engineering, Engineering Technology, Environmental Science, Information Services Technology, Cyber Security, and Mathematics and Physical Sciences.&nbsp; Project objectives included: increase enrollments by capitalizing on extensive K-16 STEM activity in the region; increase student retention through community-building, twice monthly cohort contact, mentoring, tutoring, and enrichment experiences;

Figure 1 (Awards by Gender) shows the distribution of the awards.&nbsp; 50% of the awardees were women.&nbsp; One hundred fifteen annual scholarships supporting 86 students were awarded. &nbsp;Figure 2 (Awards by Race) shows the breakdown of the awards to minority students which were approximately 50 percent.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Features of the CSM STEM Scholars Program</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monitoring Awardee Progress:&nbsp; </strong>The program had controls and reviews in place so weaker students could be quickly identified and given appropriate support for academic success.&nbsp; Each awardee&rsquo;s progress was monitored to identify whether they had maintained eligibility from semester to semester.&nbsp; Tutoring was provided for those who needed it.&nbsp; A probation procedure was used for students who fell just short of the required 3/0 GPA for renewal.&nbsp; The probation option gave borderline students another semester of scholarship aid to improve their grades while being tracked more closely.&nbsp;

49% (42/86) students graduated, receiving their associates&rsquo; degree from CSM and continued on to a 4-year institution.&nbsp; Thirty percent (25/86) of the remaining students transferred to a 4-year program.&nbsp; Fourteen percent (12/86) are still continuing to take classes at CSM.&nbsp; Eight percent (7/86) have stopped their education at this time for various reasons.&nbsp; All awardees started in college level mathematics and English as a requirement of the program.&nbsp; The most effective support of the program was the special one-to-one tutoring provided for the students.&nbsp; Only 10% of the participants did not finish with a minimum GPA of 3.0.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Enrichment Activities:</strong>&nbsp; Typically 80% of the students attended the group activities and programs organized by the CSM STEM faculty advisers.&nbsp; The special guest speakers in the different STEM fields were enjoyed by all.&nbsp;
