 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of California-Berkeley is planning to join the existing Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled \"Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi)\" currently comprised of the University of Arkansas (lead), and 9 other universities. \r\n\r\nUniversity of California at Berkeley (UC-B) is proposing to become an additional research site for the multi-university Industry /University Research Center (I/UCRC) called Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi). This new research site will focus on the biotechnology sector. This industrial sector has some unique challenges including being heavily regulated and the inherent uncertainty of biological products and ingredients. Biotech sector includes the biotech pharmaceuticals (biopharmaceuticals) industry. The UC-B research site will complement and not duplicate the research capabilities that already exist within CELDi. \r\n\r\nA research focus on biopharmaceuticals within CELDi will also have broader impact, both in terms of research and in terms of outreach. Research has the potential to positively impact the cost and availability of biopharmaceuticals, which will play an increasingly large role as a critical element of healthcare. The Berkeley site will have an education and outreach component. UC Berkeley has a strong and explicit commitment to diversity, and through research projects and courses designed with the input of industry members, a diverse group of graduate students will be educated on critical operations issues in the industry. Member firms will have a forum to share experiences, leading to more effective biopharmaceutical production, and seminars will help to disseminate advanced operations management techniques to the industry. The proposed research and outreach program can help to sustain and grow this industry, which will ultimately have a tremendous positive impact on the US economy and on the world.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) was established in 2001 to address multiple aspects of logistics.  CELDi has the mission of enabling member organizations to achieve logistics and distribution excellence by delivering meaningful, innovative, and implementable solutions that provide a return on investment.\n\nThe Berkeley Research Site of CELDi was officially established in January of 2011, with a particular focus on projects related to the biopharmaceutical industry.  Over the life of the project, the UC Berkeley Research Site of CELDi has worked with industry members to address specific issues to improve their supply chain operations, to develop an understanding of the limitations of existing operations management technologies and approaches when applied to the biopharmaceutical industry, to develop new technologies that enhance operations in the biopharmaceutical industry and beyond, and to provide students with an opportunity to learn about both operations management approaches, and how these approaches can be applied to this industry.\n\nThrough projects with both individual and groups of industry members, the research team has made significant progress in a variety of important research areas:\n\n-- Motivated by      problems faced by all of our industrial partners, we have develop and      tested a promising new approach to supply chain optimization that combines      sample path optimization with gradient search.  We have tested this      approach extensively, both in the lab and with our industrial partners.      This approach is more robust to uncertainty than current approaches that      ignore uncertainty, and is able to handle significantly more complex      models than existing approaches that account for uncertainty.\n\n-- We have      extensively explored the tradeoff between inventory and flexibility in      manufacturing networks.  Several of our industrial partners were considering      investing in either manufacturing flexibility or inventory storage      capacity to handle demand surges, and we have developed tools to better      understand this decision.  \n\n-- We developed and      characterized simple, effective approaches for supply chain planning based      on the notion of certainty equivalence (that is, approximating uncertain      values with adjusted average values in optimization models), and we      designed effective approaches for managing rare-event risk in biopharma      supply chains.  We have tested these approaches with our members.\n\n-- In many      industries there is an emerging trend of multiple suppliers and retailers      sharing a central warehouse in order to achieve horizontal collaboration.      Typically, such systems are operated in a decentralized fashion, so that      each supplier and retailer makes independent decisions.  We have      assessed the loss inherent in operating this system in a decentralized      fashion (relative to centralized operation), and we have explored      strategies that enable firms to reduce this loss.  \n\n-- Motivated by production      technology used by our member firms, we have developed optimal inventory      management strategies for manufacturing systems that use \"perfusion\" (semi-batch)      technology rather than the batch manufacturing which is typical in the      industry. \n\n-- Motivated by      planning problems faced by our member firms, we explored techniques that      integrate the data updates typical of clinical trials with production      capacity planning, with an aim of ensuring that sufficient capacity is      available when products are developed but at the same time limiting the      risk that unnecessary, expensive capacity is built.\n\n-- We have developed models      of effective inventory and risk management strategies in biopharmaceutical      supply chains, and the impact of outsourcing in these settings.\n \n\nIn addition to these specific research accomplishments, this project has had a variety of broader impacts.  By focusing on more efficient biopharmaceutical operations, the research efforts of the UC Berkeley CELDi site have the potential to ultimately lower the cost and improve the quality of healthcare.   Also, graduate students have been trained to integrate pharmaceutical-industry related concerns along with supply chain management.  Finally, CELDi as an organization serves to demonstrate how first class research can make an immediate impact on industry while continuing to advance the boundaries of academic research.  This is particularly important in fields like supply chain management and logistics, where researchers have demonstrated a tendency to focus on theoretical issues that don?t have obvious potential to impact industry.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/19/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip M Kaminsky"
