Wilson\r\nProposal # IOS-1121847\r\nCharacterization of Aphid Nutrient Amino Acid Transporters with Focus on the\r\nSymbiotic Interface\r\nSymbioses such as those between humans and their gut flora and the insect vector of\r\nChagas disease and its obligate bacterium are ubiquitous in nature impacting human\r\nhealth, biodiversity and agriculture. Insects feeding on mammalian blood or plant sap\r\nare united in their dependence on intimate symbioses with bacteria that nutritionally\r\ncompensate their hosts. While the nutritional bases of these symbioses are well\r\nunderstood, the processes and structures that mediate the intimate interactions between\r\nsymbiotic partners have been neglected and remain uncharacterized. This project aims\r\nto functionally characterize the processes and structures that mediate amino acid\r\nexchange between aphids and their bacterial symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola. Buchnera live\r\nwithin membrane-bound compartments inside aphid bacteriocyte cells. The membranes\r\nof the bacteriocytes and the specialized compartments present a challenge to amino acid\r\nexchange, a process vital to aphid survival. Specifically, this project focuses on studying\r\nthe molecules that transport amino acids across membranes at the aphid/Buchnera\r\ninterface. The investigators will experimentally determine the transport capability of\r\namino acid transporters and use microscopy to determine where these transporters are\r\nfound. Research and educational goals will merge in measurement of changes in\r\nexpression of amino acid transporter genes in response to dietary amino acid supply\r\nproviding inquiry-based research training for up to 96 undergraduates. Broadly this\r\nwork benefits genomic studies in all insect systems and additionally provides mentoring\r\nand research training for one graduate student and one early-career researcher. This\r\nproject will be the first to functionally characterize the processes and structures\r\noperating at the interface of an insect nutritional symbiosis. Importantly, understanding\r\nhow insects interact with their symbionts has the potential to facilitate development of\r\ntargeted environmentally safe control of insect vectors of human and plant disease.",
