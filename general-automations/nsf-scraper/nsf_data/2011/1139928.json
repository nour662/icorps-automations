 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) under the leadership of the University of California-Irvine, will sponsor its  seventh (7th) Bridge to the Doctorate program at the University of California-Riverside (UC-R) for the 2011-2013 academic year.  UC-R is a Hispanic-serving institution.  The program will consist of a cohort of 12 students from historically underrepresented minority populations pursuing graduate studies in science, technology, engineering and technology (STEM) fields at the institution. \r\n\r\nThe program will support LSAMP students exclusively for two years and offer newly-minted B.S. degree recipients an opportunity to matriculate in graduate education with support from STEM departments and/or external fellowship funding for the duration of the doctoral program.  Collaborative ties with the Office of Graduate Studies as well as the academic deans ensures timely and appropriate implementation of the BD activity.\r\n\r\nThe activity will provide a rich set of graduate student development opportunities that in addition to rigorous training in specific STEM disciplines will also include intensive faculty mentoring, extensive professional development, and activities that promote leadership in the scientific and engineering communities. This proposal leverages the distinctive strengths of several graduate and undergraduate research programs throughout the California Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation overall and UCR specifically to prepare BD scholars to be successful scientists and role models who can diversify the faculty ranks in research institutions. Students receive rigorous academic and research training experiences that support completion of the Ph.D. as well as future contributions to our nation's scientific and engineering expertise.  Best practices for recruitment and retention of graduate researchers are implemented and builds upon lessons learned from previous host sites. \r\n\r\nThe Bridge to the Doctorate activity at UC-R adds considerable strength to the institution and alliance which already exemplifies robust commitment to increasing diversity in STEM disciplines. The findings, lessons learned, and impact of the program will be disseminated through multi-media networks, publications, presentations at national meetings, and data sharing with NSF-affiliated initiatives with the express purpose of sharing experiences as best practices to improve the participation of underserved minorities in all STEM fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Description\n\nThe LSAMP University of California &ndash;Riverside Bridge to the Doctorate Activity had the goal of attracting twelve STEM students who received their degrees in various STEM disciplines from four-year institutions into Ph.D. graduate programs in either the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences or the College of Engineering.   In the first year, the project was able to recruit nine students into the activity with another 3 students joining the program in the second year.  By the end of the third year, three students completed M.S. degrees, five students had advanced to candidacy in their Ph.D. programs, and the remaining four are completing required course and laboratory work and will take their qualifying examinations in the next year.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe Bridge to the Doctorate activity provides the necessary training and support for students from under-represented minorities.  Students who successfully complete a Ph.D. in STEM disciplines will fill a need not only for more scientists and engineers but will more accurately reflect the diversity in both academic and professional environments.  Further, the UCR-BD activity had a balance of students in life sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering and emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary approaches for solving a variety of problems &ndash; a skill that is recognized as being vital but is seldom practiced in graduate programs. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe program has engaged BD students in extracurricular activities focusing on supporting undergraduate STEM students from under-represented backgrounds.  BD students have served as mentors for these students and served on panels describing their experiences as both undergraduates and BD fellows.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/03/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Howard Gillman"
