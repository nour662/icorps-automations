 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to implement a scholarship program to benefit students majoring in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Engineering, Physics, Mathematics, and Geological Sciences. It is increasing the retention of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students through completion of an Associate of Science degree and entry into the workforce or transfer to a four-year institution.  Cohort based special activities, faculty mentoring, and focused counseling help students succeed. \r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to provide: \r\n(a) Scholarships for students who demonstrate academic potential and financial need. \r\n(b) Cohort-based enrichment activities for scholarship recipients to increase engagement in introductory science and math coursework and subsequent retention in a STEM major. \r\n(c) Scholarship recipients with counseling, faculty mentoring, and referrals to tutoring, transfer services, career guidance, and other services as needed. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The program includes an emphasis on mentoring and enrichment activities for participating students, particularly focusing on increasing mathematics skills and helping students connect mathematics skills to other STEM disciplines. The program facilitates stronger relationships between faculty and students, providing faculty with student feedback to improve teaching.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The scholarship program is providing an economic resource for STEM students at the college, of whom 83% are Hispanic, 40% are women, and 75% are economically disadvantaged. These students often struggle to maintain full-time enrollment and complete their studies. This program provides students with financial and academic resources to help them succeed.",
