This project brings a new theoretical perspective to the study of interest group coalitions by applying network theory and methods. Such a perspective provides a lens where the attributes of individuals are less important than the relationships and ties among actors in the network. This project addresses three important questions about interest group behavior: how have interest group coalition strategies changed over time; which factors determine whether interest groups work together; and do particular interest groups wield more power before the Court? Utilizing a network measure of interest group coalitions based on cosigner status to United States Supreme Court amicus curiae, or friend of the court briefs, the central players and overall characteristics of this dynamic network from 1930 to present-day are illuminated. In addition, the analyses suggest which attributes bring interest groups to work together and how power in the network influences judicial decision-making and litigation success. \r\n\r\nThrough the creation of a new network measure applicable to 80 years of interest group activity and an associated data set of interest group characteristics, this research provides scholars an unparalleled opportunity to study the relative impact of interest group coalitions as they engage the governmental process.",
