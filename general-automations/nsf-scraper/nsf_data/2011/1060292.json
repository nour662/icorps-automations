 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project students at Salish Kootenai College, a tribal college in Montana, are named Salish Kootenai STEM Scholars (S3) to assist them in earning bachelors degrees in STEM disciplines.  In addition to the scholarships, S3 Scholars have access to individual mentoring, academic support through a tutoring center, internship opportunities in tribal technological businesses, research opportunities, student support services, math boot camps, and career counseling.  Over the five years of the grant the project aims to increase the number of STEM graduates from underrepresented groups, mostly Native American, to the national average of 14%, increase the proportion of entering freshmen declaring STEM majors to 31%, and increase the retention of declared majors graduating to 75%.  These ambitious goals are being achieved despite the high level of poverty in the area, the nontraditional student population (needs for childcare and family support), and weak high-school preparation of many of the students.",

The S<sup>3</sup> program helped 42 students graduate with a STEM degree in the six year period, 2011 &ndash; 2017.&nbsp; S<sup>3</sup> provided scholarships, peer mentoring, faculty mentoring, academic support, tutoring and comprehensive career counseling throughout the students&rsquo; academic career at SKC. The S<sup>3</sup> program&rsquo;s most significant outcome was the development and implementation of the student success mentoring model, with more details below. Essentially, the S<sup>3</sup> project provided a synergistic effort between SKC STEM disciplines, SKC student support programs and services, and the network of tribal colleges and local high schools.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The SKC S<sup>3</sup> project had some degree of success in accomplishing its goals by building upon established student outreach and service/support programs as well as through a network of area high schools, tribal colleges, local industry, and various tribal departments and elders.&nbsp; The S<sup>3</sup> project targeted underrepresented minorities and females, providing scholarship funds to those students with the greatest financial need. The three objectives were 1: Increase the percent of underrepresented minority students completing degrees in STEM disciplines offered at SKC.&nbsp; This objective was achieved, increased from seven in 2012 to 19 in 2017. Objective 2: Increase the number of students declaring STEM disciplines at SKC. This objective was not achieved, decreased from 142 in 2012 to 131 in 2017; a direct reflection in enrollment decline that SKC has experienced.&nbsp; Objective 3:&nbsp; Achieve a 75% retention rate of S<sup>3</sup> scholars by year 5 of the program. The S<sup>3</sup> program has exceeded this objective with a final program retention rate of 78%.&nbsp; Out of the 89 students that entered the program only 15 have left for various reasons. Most students left because of low GPA. For the final year the program had a total 42 BS graduates, from 2011 &ndash; 2017.</p>\n<p>Because of the lack of S<sup>3</sup> scholar attendance in Boot Camps, a student success mentoring model was implemented beginning winter quarter of 2014. During fall quarter 2015, the mentor, who is a SKC student in STEM and is also employed by the SEM tutoring lab, attended the pre-calculus course, Functions and Modeling. By attending class the mentor was able to directly support S<sup>3</sup> scholars and other STEM students in math courses. The &ldquo;gatekeeper&rdquo; course of pre-calculus was chosen for mentor involvement due its high-enrollment of S<sup>3</sup> scholars and also its high failure rate, which averages 60%.&nbsp; The goal of having the Student Success Mentor was to provide current S<sup>3</sup> scholars as well as identified future scholars, support both inside and outside the classroom. By attending classes the Mentor helped establish a relationship between the instructor and the S<sup>3</sup> scholars.&nbsp; The Success Mentor was able to gain first-hand knowledge of material presented in class and the instructor&rsquo;s expectations.&nbsp; The Student Success Mentor was able to follow-up with students in the SEM tutoring center.&nbsp; In addition, the Student Success Mentor facilitated group study sessions, sent e-mail reminders regarding scheduled tutoring sessions and assignments, and conducted follow-up sessions with students to ensure course content was understood.</p>\n<p>In the spring of 2016 the S-STEM staff implemented an expanded course mentoring program that involved the four S<sup>3</sup> scholars that are in the Mathematical Sciences program. These four student mentors attend the pre-calculus course, Trigonometry, which had an enrollment of 28 students, of which 5 were current S-STEM scholars and 18 potential scholars.&nbsp; The overall pass rate of the course with Mentors was 82%.&nbsp; In comparison, the pre-calculus course, Functions and Modeling, taught the same quarter without the use of Mentors had an initial enrollment of twelve students with only 4 or 33% successfully completing the course.</p>\n<p>Due to the success of S-STEM mentoring in Trigonometry last year, mentoring activities continued during the 2016-2017 academic year.&nbsp; The three courses were Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, and Calculus. In academic year 2016-17, these courses were selected based on the high enrollment of S-STEM scholars and STEM students who were possible scholars.&nbsp; Four existing S-STEM scholars mentored students in these classes which resulted in 100% pass rate of S-STEM scholars enrolled in the courses, 11 new scholars for the S-STEM project was the result and an increased overall pass rate from an average of 55% to average of 86%.</p>\n<p>Through the hard work and dedication of the SKC S-STEM Scholarship S<sup>3</sup> program administration, faculty, and staff, the program is deemed a success.&nbsp; The number of STEM graduates increased, the retention of S<sup>3</sup> scholars increased, and the student success mentoring model has been institutionalized due it its success.
