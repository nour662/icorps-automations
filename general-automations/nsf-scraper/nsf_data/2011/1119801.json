 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parasitic plants obtain nutrients from host plants via a unique organ (the haustorium) and, thus, may  negatively impact the survival and reproductive success of the host. Many parasites are completely dependent on their host, having lost the ability to make their own food through photosynthesis. This proposal focuses on a poorly known and diverse lineage of tropical parasitic plants through field studies in diversity hotspots on three continents. Variation in morphology and host preference will be documented and DNA sequence data will be used to assess evolutionary relationships.  This evolutionary framework will be used to create a revised classification system and to investigate transitions in modes of parasitism, such as the loss of photosynthetic capability.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates a plant lineage which includes parasites that infest crops, resulting in annual losses worth several billion $US. An introduction of witchweed (Striga asiatica) was so damaging to the US corn crop that most tropical parasites are classified as noxious weeds. However, USDA agents have no means of differentiating a dangerous parasite from a harmless one. This project will provide an important online resource to assist border agents, farmers, and researchers in identifying noxious parasites wherever they occur, whether at points of entry into the US or in their native ranges.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nParasitic plants negatively affect crop yields worldwide, yet the hardest hit agricultural economies are those of developing nations in the tropics. Three of the four most dangerous parasitic plant genera (Striga, Alectra, and Aeginetia) are derived from one lineage of the broomrape family (Orobanchaceae). Despite advanced research on existing crop parasites, the remaining 33 genera and ~180 species are poorly collected, documented, and parasitize a virtually unknown range of potential host species.  This is especially dangerous in sub-Saharan Africa where human population growth and expanding agricultural landscapes will expose crop hosts to these parasites for the first time. Further, parasites in this lineage exhibit a number of shifts in the degree of parasite-host dependency along a spectrum from plants that are fully capable of photosynthesis to those that rely solely on their host plants for nutrients.  \n\nIn this study, we documented parasitic plant localities in sub-Saharan Africa (including Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Africa, and Lesotho), Madagascar, Mexico, Brazil, and China.  Host plant identities were determined, and DNA was extracted from a total of 146 species.  Morphological data was gathered to ease species identification. DNA sequences from select genes were used to infer relationships among members of this tropical lineage. Notably, 18 genera that have never been included in any phylogenetic study were sampled for our work. Additionally, whole chloroplast genome sequences were obtained from exemplars from 13 of the sub-lineages. \n\nWhile final data analysis is not yet complete, all data have been obtained and several interesting results can be derived from preliminary analyses.  We have confirmed that species of many of the genera sampled comprise coherent lineages, and yet some do not.  Although Buchnera species occur in both the New World and Old World tropics, species comprise a single lineage with a central African origin and a single dispersal to the new world. The same is true of species of Alectra.  Melasma, while morphologically coherent, includes multiple independently derived lineages, with one originating in Africa, and several others from within New World lineages. Striga is not a coherent lineage unless it includes species of the genus Cycniopsis; this indicates that species of Cycniopsis are potentially dangerous crop parasites as are some Striga species. \n\nAnalysis of chloroplast genomes indicate that shifts in host dependency are more complex than originally thought.  Within the genus Harveya we see a shift from chloroplasts that bear full complements of functional genes to those that are moderately degraded&mdash;indicating that photosynthetic capability has been lost, and recently.  In contrast, we see increasing degradation in Hyobanche (moderately degraded) and Christisonia (heavily degraded). The crop parasite Aeginetia indica exhibits the greatest degree of degradation of the chloroplast genome; it is roughly 36% the size of fully functional chloroplast genomes seen in other members of this tropical parasitic lineage, and many genes required for photosynthesis are no longer present.\n\nFunding was also used to train students in advanced methods that might have otherwise been impossible.  Collaborating institution Sam Houston State University (SHSU) is designated as an undergraduate research university.  The Department of Biological Sciences does not host a Ph.D. program.  Therefore, nearly all of the data gathered in this study by SHSU were obtained by undergraduate researchers.  Nine SHSU undergraduate students and one Master?s student were trained in molecular phylogenetic techniques.  Of these, five received additional training in field, herbarium, and lab methods at the Summer Research Institute at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden. Many of the students trained under this project were minorities under-represented in STEM fields, including six women, one of whom is African-American, one of whom is Hispanic-American, and one disabled student.\n\nAdditionally, we received supplemental funding from an International Research Experience for Undergraduates (IREU) program sponsored jointly by NSF and its counterpart in Brazil.
