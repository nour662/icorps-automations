The principal speaker will be Doug Nychka, Director of the Institute for Mathematics and Geosciences at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO.  \r\n\r\nStatistical climatology is of timely importance, as there is a need for the development of more and better statistical methodology to handle climate data.  The 10 main lectures at this conference will focus on three types of topics: (1) a description of the climate system, the way climatologists model it, and how to draw inferences from such models; (2) useful tools; and (3) case studies in regional model comparison, paleoclimatology, and data assimilation.\r\n\r\nThe NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conference \"Statistical Climatology\" will introduce a new generation of mathematical scientists to this exciting area, while building a cadre of workers in this important field. This award will support 30 participants at this conference, with a focus on junior faculty and graduate students.",
