 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: This project is on \"foliated graphene\" or thin carbon sheets grown on the sidewall of multiwall carbon nanotubes. Studying this materials system from the nucleation and growth to the atomic level surface chemistry and structure to the electronic properties will enable a rigorous intellectual assessment of this unique material and the development of phenomenological models of nucleation and growth. An iterative nucleation, growth, materials analysis, and properties measurements feedback loop is expected to be established through this research project to insure the most rapid and effective knowledge creation and implementation. A combined kinetic-thermodynamic approach is used to evaluate foliated graphene nucleation thresholds as well as measure growth rates as a function of critical parameters such as carbon nanotube diameter, catalyst nanoparticle size and temperature to understand rate determining steps and activation energies for the model development. Electron microscopy, Raman scattering and photoemission spectroscopy measurements are used to examine the structure, chemistry and graphene-nanotube interfaces as a function of these nucleation and growth parameters. \r\nNontechnical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science and engineering with potential technological relevance. High charge densities of the graphene edges will be exploited via supercapacitance (for energy storage), charge injection (for neural stimulation electrodes), and field emission (for vacuum microelectronic devices). The research is expected to provide insight into the growth mechanisms of nanostructured carbon materials. Graduate and undergraduate students are trained in an interdisciplinary environment for materials growth, characterization, and modeling.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe aim of this project was to create and understand the properties of a new graphene-carbon nanotube hybrid nanomaterial.  Termed \"graphenated carbon nanotubes\" or g-CNTs, this material combines a high surface area carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold with few-layered graphene \"foliates,\" which have very high charge storage capacity and surface area.   g-CNTs possess particularly interesting properties for applications including electrochemical charge storage, neural stimulation electrodes, gas sensing, and cold-cathode field emission. \n\n \n\nNanomaterial Growth and Morphological Properties:\n\ng-CNTs are grown in a similar method to multi-walled CNTs.  Microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is employed first to transition a thin (5 nm) iron catalyst film on a silicon substrate into discrete islands or nanoparticles.  Then a carbon-containing gas is introduced to nucleate CNTs at the nanoparticle sites.  Insight into the growth of g-CNTs and similar materials was gained through probing the way that process parameters impact the resultant nanostructure morphology.   The most impactful parameter is temperature, as seen in Figure 1, which allows for a transition from CNTs to g-CNTs, and then to carbon nanosheets (CNSs) despite other input parameters remaining the same.  In addition, electrochemical capacitance was measured across this range of morphologies, finding that g-CNTs outperform CNTs or CNSs as a supercapacitor electrode material (Figure 2).\n\n \n\nWe have considered two possible formation mechanisms for the graphene foliates on the CNT sidewalls.  The first involves mechanical buckling of the nanotube sidewalls due to differences in growth rate of the concentric nanotube walls, which causes fracture resulting in the foliated graphene structure.  Alternatively it is possible that ion bombardment from the plasma causes defects to arise in the nanotube sidewalls as they grow, which act as nucleation sites for graphene foliates.\n\n \n\nOverview of Performance as a Supercapacitor Electrode Material:\n\nDespite many potential applications of the material, the property we have studied primarily is specific capacitance.  As mentioned above, different morphologies grown at various temperatures were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), which establish g-CNTs as a superior supercapacitor electrode material compared with CNTs or CNSs.  A separate electrochemical measurement technique known as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to compare g-CNTs with CNTs primarily for neural stimulation applications.  At low frequency, which is the regime of most interest for neural stimulation, g-CNTs show a 5.4x increase in capacitance relative to CNTs as a function of sample weight, and a 7.3x increase as a function of sample area.  Additionally, increasing the density of graphene foliates causes an increase in specific capacitance as well as a reduction in charge transfer resistance, as seen in Figure 3.\n\n \n\nStructure-Property Relationships for Supercapacitor Applications:\n\nBy using the technique of Raman spectroscopy, it is possible to study the microstructure of carbon nanostructures in a nondestructive way, providing information about the defect density of the materials.  The crystallite size, or the average space between defects, may be calculated by this method.  By varying the density of graphene foliates and comparing results to CNTs, CNSs, and amorphous carbon, a linear relationship was found between the crystallite size of each material and its specific capacitance as measured by CV.  Figure 4 illustrates this trend across many morphologies of nanostructured carbon spanning a wide range of crystallite sizes.\n\n \n\nIt is possible to modify the g-CNT structure through secondary deposition techniques, especially atomic layer deposition (ALD), which may be used to deposit metal oxides through a self-limiting layer-by-layer growth method.  As part of a study aimed at determining the surface area of laboratory-scale nano..."
