 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this CAREER project, jointly funded by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, is to develop a physics-based coarse-grained force field that can be widely applicable for modeling proteins and regulation of protein-protein interactions.  Although simulation methods that evolve the classical dynamics of atomically detailed models have contributed considerable insight into the structure and equilibrium fluctuations of single proteins, the computational expense of all-atom models limits their application for more complex systems.  These limitations have motivated tremendous interest in coarse-grained (CG) models that provide much greater computational efficiency, while still providing a detailed description of protein structure.  Many CG models can be broadly categorized as either knowledge-based or physics-based models.  Knowledge-based models are empirically developed using statistics compiled from experimentally-determined structures present in the protein databank (PDB).  In contrast, physics-based protein models are developed using more rigorous theories and, consequently, hold the potential for greater accuracy. This project bridges the gap between knowledge- and physics-based models by employing a rigorous statistical mechanics framework to develop protein models from PDB structures.  This project will first quantify and systematically improve the approximations employed in current knowledge-based methods.  These results will guide the development of a highly efficient CG model that accurately describes the structure and interactions for a wide range of proteins.  \r\n\r\nThe PI will develop a pioneering intergenerational science club (ISC) to capitalize upon the vastly underused expertise of emeritus faculty to strengthen local intergenerational community, enrich K-12 education in underserved rural Pennsylvania, and promote an active lifestyle of life-long learning.  The ISC will be initially developed as series of lectures for local retirees given by emeritus Penn State faculty, but will develop laboratory components and also additional outreach to K-12 students.  This program will provide unique intergenerational mentorship for students of all ages and employ discovery-based education to inform the general electorate about the impact of cutting-edge scientific research upon modern society. The Penn State Outreach Office and the Pennsylvania Cooperative Extension will publish and distribute the program further propagating its impact.  This project will also develop interdisciplinary physical chemistry curriculum and supplemental lectures to empower chemistry students with the rigorous mathematical and physical tools necessary for addressing the fundamental scientific challenges of the future.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nComputational models provide a powerful complement to experiment.  In particular, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with atomically detailed models provide exquisite insight into the structure and dynamics of proteins and other biomolecules.  However, given current computational resources, atomically detailed MD simulations remain prohibitively time-consuming to effectively investigate many important biological processes, such as the protein-protein interactions that regulate protein degradation in vivo.  These considerations have motivated tremendous interest in developing coarse-grained (CG) models that provide much greater computational efficiency by representing biomolecules in reduced detail, i.e., by replacing atoms with a smaller number of larger CG particles.  Of course, the utility of such models critically depends upon determining the correct forces between these CG particles.  Popular knowledge-based (KB) approaches empirically determine these forces from the statistics of experimentally determined protein structures.  However, KB approaches generally provide relatively limited accuracy for modeling protein structure and interactions.  More generally, because they average over atomic details and because this averaging depends upon the local environment and thermodynamic conditions, CG models tend to provide poor accuracy for describing environments other than the one for which they were parameterized. \n\n \n\nThis project focused on addressing these fundamental limitations of current CG models.  A key result of this project is the demonstration that conventional KB approaches correspond to specific approximations within a rigorous physics-based framework.  Using this physics-based framework, we examined the inter-relations between various approaches for constructing CG models and clarified the physical origins of their limited accuracy and transferability.  Moreover, we developed computational methods for improving the accuracy and transferability of CG models.  For instance, we developed accurate minimal models (i.e., CG models that represent each amino acid with a single CG particle) for both ordered and disordered peptides with between 12 and 15 amino acids.  We also demonstrated the limitations of such models, while indicating approaches to improve their accuracy.  Additionally, we demonstrated a systematic approach for improving the transferability of CG models for describing multiple temperatures and multiple environments.  Finally, we developed a general framework clarifying the importance of the CG representation upon the accuracy and transferability of CG models.  In particular, by deriving the exact CG potential for a simple model of protein conformational fluctuations, we systematically examined the impact of resolution upon the accuracy and information content of CG protein models. \n\n \n\nThis funding provided training for graduate and postdoctoral researchers in computational chemistry and biophysics, as well as in coarse-grained modeling, in particular.  The project also enabled instruction of graduate and undergraduate students in the statistical thermodynamic principles that link molecular interactions to macroscopic properties.  Finally, this project enabled the development of an intergenerational science club that informs senior citizens of basic scientific principles and the impact of science upon daily life, integrates them into discovery-based scientific inquiry, promotes life-long learning, and develops intergenerational community between the academic and local community.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William Noid"
