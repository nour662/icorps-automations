 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a workshop on virtual repositories for archaeological science, data sharing, and research collaboration. The PI points out that geography, multi-agency ownership, borrowing restrictions, restrictions on access to collections and the issue of transporting fragile objects are issues creating a growing need for virtual repositories or cyberinfrastructure that will allow for researchers to access, integrate, and mine diverse collections and data assemblages at scales not currently possible within existing frameworks. This workshop will bring together museum curators, archaeologists, and computer scientists to create a model for virtual repositories of arctic collections that could be a pilot for much larger project that ultimately would serve as a virtual representation of a museum's entire inventory or complete archaeological collections and archives.    The proposed workshop would be held at Idaho State University in the Fall of 2011 and will include key actors from academia, federal agencies and Alaska Native communities.",
