 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UNC Institute for the Environment (IE), in partnership with the North Carolina Alliance to Create Opportunity Through Education (OPT-ED), is engaged in a multi-pronged, five-year effort to increase substantially the participation of underrepresented minority (URM) students in geoscience research and education in North Carolina. The Increasing Diversity and Enhancing Academia (IDEA) partnership is expanding the existing NC OPT-ED network by adding a geoscience research focus and extending the program to Elizabeth City State University (ECSU), an Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in eastern North Carolina. The NSF-funded OPT-ED program is a formal alliance of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), North Carolina State University (NCSU), and North Carolina Agricultural & Technical University (NC A&T) that encourages URM students to pursue doctorates and supports other education programming for URM students. The proposed project is using place-based approaches to engage minority students from eastern North Carolina in understanding and solving geoscience problems facing their region, with an emphasis on the linkages between watershed hydrology, coastal marine processes, land use change and developing climate change.  The IDEA project objectives are to: implement hands-on and minds-on geosciences activities for URM high school students to encourage their education to the next level; recruit and prepare undergraduates to pursue MS and PhD degrees in the geosciences; and, provide high quality geosciences research experiences for undergraduate students in the summer and academic year.  These goals are being achieved through a combination of project activities that include summer science enrichment programs for high school students; a Saturday pre-college academy for secondary school students; an alliance day for secondary and post-secondary students that provides professional development workshops; academic year and summer research experiences for undergraduates; and other professional development and networking events for undergraduate students.  The project includes resources to support students financially, develops critical skills that help students be better prepared for pursuing advanced degrees, and provides significant mentoring by university faculty and administrators at the partner institutions.",

Specifically, the program provided academic year and summer research internships and career development for 37 URM and/or female undergraduate students. The program also provided a geoscience-focused science enrichment program for 100 URM and/or female high school students, with a week-long summer institute followed by Saturday Academies during the school year.</p>\n<p>Over five years, the IDEA program provided 69 mentored research experiences to 42 undergraduates. (When possible, some students continued their research over multiple program years.) Of these 42 students, 37 identified as female and/or URM. Eight attended universities other than UNC-Chapel Hill, including three HBCUs&mdash;Elizabeth City State University, Johnson C. Smith University and North Carolina Central University&mdash;as well as North Carolina State University, and UNC-Charlotte. Program outcomes included scholarly publications&mdash;two co-authors on peer-reviewed journal articles, two co-authors on software, and one co-author on a website&mdash;as well as 17 oral and poster presentations at regional, national, and international conferences and 55 poster presentations at university symposia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Evaluation data, obtained in annual surveys following the research internships from 2012-2016 (n=47), showed increases in participating students&rsquo; perceptions of competence in a number of scientific research skills. For example, following the program, 75% of respondents reported feeling &ldquo;very&rdquo; or &ldquo;adequately&rdquo; competent in communicating research <em>in writing</em> compared to only 15% before the internship. Similarly, 77% reported feeling &ldquo;very&rdquo; or &ldquo;adequately&rdquo; competent in communicating research <em>orally</em> following program participation, compared to only 23% before. About 87% of respondents reported feeling &ldquo;very&rdquo; or &ldquo;adequately&rdquo; competent in reading and interpreting geosciences literature after the program, compared to 32% who reported this competence before the program. Finally, 83% reported feeling prepared to interpret data after participating in the program, compared to only 34% before program participation. In addition to gaining research experience and important technical skills, these students developed productive relationships with their research mentors and prepared themselves to mentor future URM and female students.</p>\n<p>In a 2016 survey of alumni of the undergraduate program, almost 40% of respondents agreed that participation in the IDEA program motivated them to apply to graduate school, with about 26% reporting plans to pursue a master&rsquo;s or doctoral degree in geosciences. Roughly 93% of respondents strongly agreed that participation in the IDEA program increased their level of confidence in their research skills and ability to pursue a graduate degree as well as their feelings of confidence \"as a scientist\". Students also reported substantial gains in their understanding of scientific research, geoscience research, and career possibilities in the geosciences as a result of program participation.</p>\n<p>The IDEA program also provided 105 high school students with geoscience-focused science enrichment programming over a five year period. Of these students, 100 identified as female and/or URM. Evaluation data showed that a majority of these students reported increased interest in geosciences, in science careers and in attending college following the program. In surveys administered after each summer science institute (2012-2016, n=100 across all five years), students were asked to describe their interest in the geosciences as a result of the program. Over 75% of respondents in four of the cohorts described themselves as &ldquo;fairly&rdquo; or &ldquo;very&rdquo; interested. (In the 2016 cohort, 60% of respondents described themselves in this way.) Over all five cohorts, 66% of respondents &ldquo;strongly agreed&rdquo; that participating in IDEA helped them become more interested in attending college, and 66% &ldquo;strongly agreed&rdquo; that the week&rsquo;s activities challenged them to think in new ways about science and science careers. Additionally, 62% of respondents &ldquo;strongly agreed&rdquo; that they planned to take advantage of additional scientific research opportunities while in high school.</p>\n<p>Participating high school students also reported that they gained knowledge about issues that directly impacted their communities, such as water quality and climate change. They were introduced to critical thinking and team building skills that will prepare them to make informed decisions that take into account dynamic social, economic and environmental conditions in their communities. Additionally, many of the&nbsp;high school participants experienced research settings (including labs, field sites, and university classrooms) for the first time. As a result, the IDEA program enabled participating students to envision themselves as future geoscientists and to see the geoscience departments at UNC-Chapel Hill and NC Central University as viable options for college.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/30/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lawrence&nbsp;E&nbsp;Band</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1107897/1107897_10133123_1504028249994_Summer2015_HS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1107897/1107897_10133123_1504028249994_Summer2015_HS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"IDEA High School Student - 2015\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1107897/1107897_10133123_1504028249994_Summer2015_HS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"IDEA High School Student - 2015\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">IDEA High School student examines streambed composition during a stream study of Ellerbee Creek in Durham, NC</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">IDEA Program, UNC-CH</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lawrence&nbsp;E&nbsp;Band</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">IDEA High School Student - 2015</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1107897/1107897_10133123_1504098891639_Fall2013_Undergrad--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1107897/1107897_10133123_1504098891639_Fall2013_Undergrad--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"IDEA Undergraduate - 2013\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1107897/1107897_10133123_1504098891639_Fall2013_Undergrad--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"IDEA Undergraduate - 2013\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">IDEA Undergraduate conducts phytoplankton research in UNC Marine Science lab</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">IDEA Program, UNC-CH</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lawrence&nbsp;E&nbsp;Band</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">IDEA Undergraduate - 2013</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
