 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the study of computer simulations of black holes in orbit with each other or with neutron stars.  More specifically, computer codes will be developed to construct numerical solutions to Einstein's equations of General Relativity.  The emphasis of this project will be to explore methods and algorithms for the initial data for isolated black holes or black holes in orbit that will lead to models of orbiting black holes that are more realistic than those that are currently available.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding black holes in binary systems is important for our understanding of gravity, one of the four fundamental forces of nature.  In more practical terms, accurate models of orbiting black holes are crucial for data analysis in the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), designed to detect gravitational radiation emitted by such systems.  This award also supports undergraduate students who are actively involved in this research, and who receive valuable training preparing them for future careers in the sciences and beyond.",
