 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program supports Professor Bradley Smith of the University of Notre Dame to study chemiluminescent and fluorescent dyes that can be stored at zero degrees and then made to emit visible or near-infrared light by simply warming to body temperature. The research plan builds on the recent discovery of squaraine rotaxane endoperoxides, interlocked high energy molecules with a unique ability to emit light without chemical or electrical stimulus. The research objective is to improve fundamental understanding of the chemical process that produces the chemiluminescence and to use the new knowledge to design and prepare dyes with outstanding emission properties. \r\n\r\nThe work may enable a range of new biotechnology and nanotechnology applications that employ self-illuminating dyes for enhanced detection. The core training of research students is in organic chemistry and photochemistry with an emphasis on chemical structure, synthesis, and reaction mechanism. The broader impact is enhanced by a semi-formal interaction with a separate group of science business students who study entrepreneurship.",
