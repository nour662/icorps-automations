The workshop will be held at the Hotel Monaco in Alexandria, VA on June 12-14 2011, with roughly 25-30 participants including geochemists, chemical physicists, both theoretical and experimental, and atmospheric modelers. \r\n\r\nThe workshop is expected to lay the basis for research that will help us understand the important atmospheric transformations that laid the basis for the emergence of life on our planet.  Long-lasting collaborations and strategic alliances may naturally arise among the workshop participants themselves, who represent a diverse range of universities, national and international laboratories, and nationalities, as well as scientific disciplines, but the findings of this workshop will be disseminated very broadly. In choosing the potential participants, due consideration has also been paid to achieving a balance of gender, age, and ethnicity.  To foster domestic graduate student training and postdoctoral mentorship, a number of participants from this group of next-generation researchers will also be encouraged to attend the workshop. A workshop of the highly interdisciplinary type proposed here should be especially beneficial for these newer members of the scientific research community.",
