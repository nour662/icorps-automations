 "awd_abstract_narration": "The addition of eye trackers into laboratories at two institutions introduces this type of instrumentation into a broad range of psychology courses, class-associated laboratory sections, and faculty research. The project exposes a wide range of undergraduate students and faculty to state-of-the-art eye movement research techniques in five areas of psychology, linguistics, biological neuroscience, and computer science. Recent developments in video-based eye trackers are revolutionizing the ability of researchers to precisely determine where a participant is looking as a means to investigate aspects of human cognitive processing. As eye tracking technology continues to become more powerful, portable, and affordable, it has become a standard instrument for psychological science. The collaboration between Macalester College and Augsburg College reaches a diverse student population and provides another tool in the methodological arsenals available to faculty to integrate eye movement research techniques into on-going courses and laboratories. Through faculty enhancement activities, the project encourages interdisciplinary research among colleagues at other neighboring institutions along with introducing the public to eye movement science through museum-based outreach activities. As eye tracking research becomes more common in behavioral science, students and faculty mastering the methodology become more informed consumers and producers of eye movement research and educational activities.",
