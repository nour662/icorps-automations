 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the harvesting and conversion of mechanical energy from low-level ambient vibration into usable electrical energy. Utilizing the unique properties of \"essentially\" nonlinear vibrating systems, it develops multi degree-of-freedom, passive, broadband devices that will increase the efficiency and performance of energy harvesting systems acting on low-level ambient vibrations. Three research tasks are undertaken: 1) analysis of the system-level dynamics including nonlinearity in both the mechanical resonator and the electrical charging system; 2) design and application of multidegree-of-freedom resonators to enhance harvesting; and 3) experimental verification of proposed designs. Furthermore, collaboration with a group at the University of Bristol (UK) seeks to incorporate state of the art energy conversion strategies that can work efficiently in conjunction with the broadband resonator to produce a reliable, consistent source of power. \r\n\r\nThe research is anticipated to lead to an enabling technology for next-generation portable devices and wireless sensors and provide a novel framework for the design and optimization of systems that incorporate nonlinear elements. Finally, this project enhances the diversity of the engineering community through targeted outreach, undergraduate research programs, and the support of students from underrepresented groups.",

Responding to this need, this project aimed to contribute towards the development of lightweight devices capable of energy harvesting of even low-level ambient vibrations in the environment. However, contrary to conventional linear energy harvesting devices, whose operation is narrowband and, hence, restricted to work only under specific loading scenarios, the devices developed from this work are based on intentional use of strong nonlinearity to achieve broadband energy harvesting over a broad range of vibrations, that is for a broad range of ambient excitations. The developed approach utilized intentional high-frequency dynamical instabilities in the harvester component that enabled efficient harvesting of impulsive loads similar to those generated during human activities, such as walking or jumping. This dictated research in diverse theoretical and experimental methods that were&nbsp;synergistically combined and implemented in the final designs of the harvesting devices. Theoretical work required the application of strongly nonlinear asymptotic techniques, since conventional methods assuming weak nonlinearities were inapplicable for studying the developed harvesters. Experimental methods fully validated the theoretical predictions, and were based on geometrically nonlinear wires to induce strong nonlinearity, as well as piezoelectric- and electromagnetic-based conversion of mechanical oscillation to electric energy. The end&nbsp;result was an electromagnetic experimental device that is capable of producing electrical energy in a reliable way under single impulses (single events) or repetitive impulses (sustained events). We anticipate that the developed lightweight and small-scale devices can be used for efficient energy harvesting resulting from human activities such as walking, running or jumping. An example of how could this can be achieved is by incorporating such harvesting devices as parts of shoes so that impulse or vibration excitations generated by human activities can be harvested in an efficient, reliable and low-cost way. Another possible outcome of this project is the design of small and modular nonlinear devices in order to harvest the vibrations of building generated by winds or seismic events. In that case the harvesters can be attached in civil infrastructure and designed to convert to electricity the ambient building vibration. This could be achieved, given the high tunability of the developed nonlinear energy harvesters with energy, caused by the implemented concept of intentional strong nonlinearity. Future work will consider implementing the developed harvesting devices in practical applications, and to extend this work to energy harvesting from sea waves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/23/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alexander&nbsp;F&nbsp;Vakakis</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1100722/1100722_10077640_1437664112148_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1100722/1100722_10077640_1437664112148_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Model and realization of energy harvester\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1100722/1100722_10077640_1437664112148_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Model and realization of energy harvester\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The figure shows the mathematical model an...",
