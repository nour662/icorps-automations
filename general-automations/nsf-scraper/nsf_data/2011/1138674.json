The robot, to be donated to International Rescue System Institute at Tohoku University in Sendai, will be based on the recent improvements that would make CRAWLER more resistant to water and more cleanable and maintainable. The system expands on the present robotic systems developed by the team to enable the use of multi-camera, orthogonal vision system for emergency responders that would be attached to the robot for enhanced situational awareness. This new vision subsystem constitutes part of its novelty. The Japanese-USA academic researcher team will be engaged in some of the following activities:\r\n-\tDevelop methods to analyze the efficacy of the improved robot?s vision system.\r\n-\tEngineer and deploy the robot to collect data about the degree of contamination. \r\n-\tDeploy the robots in Japan through Japanese colleagues at the International Rescue System Institute at Tohoku University in Sendai.\r\nThe investigators collaborate with Dr. Satoshi Tadokoro (Tohoku University), a search and rescue researcher. A support letter has been submitted by Dr. Tadokoro for the proposed joint research. The project is expected to fabricate an improved version of the robots (developed under a separate NSF grant) in extreme environment tests, and donate this robot to the Japanese lab for joint experimentation and in-situ testing. Additional funding is also requested to travel to Japan for collaborative research and experimentation.  Proposed are also interactions and coordinating efforts with Robin Murphy (TAMU) who is organizing a workshop following up on the disaster in Japan (the related travel funds are not part of this proposal).\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis proposal promises an immediate benefit to society by supporting economic recovery efforts in Japan through a participatory research paradigm. Moreover, long term benefits for future disasters are in evidence since emergency response and unmanned systems are both formative domains and the data collected will advance the discovery and understanding of intelligent, human-centered systems in unpredictable situations. In addition, the use of the proposed tool should establish an important milestone in robotics allowing the nuclear power industry to be better positioned to rapidly respond to disasters in the future. Finally, the project aims to train undergraduate and graduate students and expose them to high-impact application areas. The PIs have strong track record in advising underrepresented students.",
