 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now possible to envision global-scale measurements of accurate, seasonal variations of oxygen concentrations in the upper 2000 meters of the ocean by improving the quality of in situ oxygen measurements. These measurements can presently be made remotely by floats, moorings, and gliders. Analysis of data returned so far from oxygen sensors on Argo floats indicates that accuracy of these measurements is presently not sufficient to solve the pressing problems of air-sea oxygen exchange and slow decadal-scale O2 change in the thermocline. However, recent work with oxygen measurements on moorings and gliders suggest that it is possible to determine oxygen concentrations using available sensors to better than +/- 0.5 % accuracy if calibration protocols are established, which would be sufficient to address these problems. \r\n\r\nIn this project, researchers at the University of Washington hope to demonstrate this using float-based Aanderaa Optode sensors calibrated before and during float deployment in a location of strategic oceanographic interest -- the Northwest Pacific Kuroshio Extension. This is a region of intense pCO2 draw down in winter caused by a combination of physical and biological processes.  The team will evaluate the relative importance of biological processes in creating the carbon sink by determining the net biological oxygen production from O2 data determined on floats and on a surface mooring in the area.  \r\n\r\nThe project thus has two main goals: (1) to test the procedures necessary to improve accuracy of in situ oxygen measurements on profiling floats so that a protocol for future expansion of O2 sensor deployment can be developed; and (2) to determine the role of biological production in controlling the dramatic wintertime draw-down of surface ocean pCO2 in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. The team will deploy 10 Argo floats (constructed at Argo expense) with oxygen sensors in the Kuroshio Extension region. An oxygen sensor and gas tension device will also be deployed on an existing surface mooring in the region to derive a much more detailed data time series to compare with the float measurements. The oxygen sensors will be calibrated both in the laboratory before deployment and in situ in the ocean after deployment by comparing their output to measurements by Winkler titration. The floats will be programmed to make measurements in the atmosphere when they surface to transmit data to shore via satellite as a means of in situ calibration. With this calibration redundancy they will be able to determine the protocol necessary to achieve accurate in situ O2 data on a much broader scale with less extensive calibration. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. Broader impacts to the marine research community include development of a protocol for calibration of O2 sensors so they can be used more broadly in situ on autonomous platforms. Broader impacts to education involve a \"student cruise\" on the University of Washington research vessel RV T.G. Thompson.  This cruise will expose 10-15 undergraduate students to the experience of field oceanography and marine research, while fulfilling their required capstone research for the undergraduate oceanography degree. The University of Washington has committed twelve days of the ship time to accommodate the educational aspects of the study.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n          The goal of this research project was to develop methods for determining accurate oxygen measurements using profiling floats in the ocean.  Presently the Argo program, supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),  funds scientists to deploy profiling floats in the ocean to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature (T) and salinity (S).  Profiling floats are released from ocean-going ships to drift with the currents while they measure profiles of temperature and salinity in the upper 2000 meters of the ocean.  The floats send their data back to land each time they surface, which is about once every ten days, and they operate for about five years before their batteries are drained.   There are about 4000 profiling floats presently in the ocean.  About 1/10 of these floats have oxygen (O2) sensors in addition to those for T and S as part of the float package.  Oxygen sensors were added because O2 is a valuable ocean tracer, which requires very little battery power, does not take up much space on the float, and sensors are available for about $5000 each.  The problem with the oxygen measurements has been that the O2 sensors used so far are not accurate enough to determine the air-sea flux of oxygen, which is one of the reasons for putting them on the float.\n\n            We made a few very small and inexpensive modifications to the Argo floats to calibrate the oxygen sensors against atmospheric oxygen, which is everywhere identical near the ocean surface.  We constructed eleven Argo floats with these modifications and deployed them in the ocean off Japan in the Kuroshio Extension.  Oxygen sensors for our special O2-floats were calibrated first in our laboratory and then compared with a profile of oxygen measured using traditional titration methods when the floats were deployed.  They then are calibrated against atmospheric oxygen every ten days when the profiling floats surface to send their data back to our laboratory.  We showed that these procedures result in data that is accurate at the ocean surface to about +/- 0.2 %.   This accuracy is sufficient to determine the air-sea flux of oxygen, which we have demonstrated in a series of three journal papers that are presently in different stages of publication.\n\n            Broader impacts of this research consisted of student teaching and mentoring, especially during the float deployment cruise.   Our specially-made profiling floats were deployed on an ocean cruise from Yokohama, Japan in the winter of 2013.  This cruise doubled as a \"research cruise\" for Oceanography students at the University of Washington.  Eleven undergraduate students and three graduate students accompanied us on the ship doing various different chemical measurements.  For the undergraduates these measurements became the subject of a research paper which is required for the undergraduate degree. For the graduate students the measurements were incorporated into their PhD research.  In particular, this work was the basis for the PhD research of Seth Bushinsky, who defended his dissertation in October of 2015.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven R Emerson"
