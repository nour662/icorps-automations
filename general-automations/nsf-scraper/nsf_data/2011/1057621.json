 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jonathan J. Wilker of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University will explore the development of methods for the synthesis of carbon rich organometallics based on the combination of Ruthenium and sigma-iso-triacetylene ligands.  The past efforts by the carbon rich organometallics community have focused on linear conjugated systems with oligo-yne, oligo-ene and oligo-phenyleneethynylene bridges.  The incorporation of sigma-iso-triacetylene requires the development of novel synthetic chemistry.  This project may expand our knowledge base about metal-alkynyl compounds.  Furthermore, the ubiquitous cross-conjugation manifested by the iso-triacetylene bridge may result in novel physical properties that are absent in the linearly conjugated organometallics, especially the quantum interference effect. \r\n\r\nThe success of the proposed research will enrich the understanding of charge transfer processes in carbon-rich organometallic species and may lead to novel molecular wires and active materials for devices.  In addition, this project will provide excellent training for  undergraduate students and graduate students, broadening participation through the inclusion of the students from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.  It will also contribute to the existing Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program at Purdue University.",
