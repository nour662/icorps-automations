 "awd_abstract_narration": "Turbulence near the earth's surface under low wind speed conditions (which are common to nighttime and other stably stratified conditions) is primarily generated by gravity waves and other small-scale non-turbulent motions.  Although such processes have received little attention and are poorly understood, the nocturnal near-calm regime is common, particularly with high-pressure systems over flat terrain and under a wider variety of synoptic conditions in small basins and valleys with weak down-valley slope.  The time-averaged surface flux is then dominated by infrequent mixing events of unknown origin.  Existing methods of data analysis have generally failed to identify the basic physics of generation of mixing events under such conditions.  Proper attribution of the root causes of the mixing events requires more emphasis on spatial variation than provided in existing analysis strategies.  This project will provide such emphasis by initially focusing on dense networks of sonic anemometers and auxiliary data to more comprehensively characterize the temporal and spatial variability of the turbulence as well as mean turbulence quantities.  Obtained representations will include scale-dependent probability distributions and stochastic models with extreme-value capabilities.  Such approaches require very large data sets, which have been recently acquired.  Since the non-turbulent motions and event mixing can be site dependent, a more limited version of the analysis will be applied to ~20 different field programs representing a wide range of surface conditions.  To obtain more even finer spatial information, the investigator plans to deploy fiber-optic cables capable of providing high density information on temperature fluctuations and video based semi-Lagrangian tracking of machine-generated fog elements, all embedded within a new network of sonic anemometers and pressure sensors.  These measurements will be integrated with tower profiles of turbulence quantities and deeper profiling from sodars to examine the generation of mixing events in a quasi-three dimensional framework.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this effort centers on pioneering work to understand and stochastically describe those complex flow features involving superposition of waves, microfronts and other complex non-deterministic signatures thought to be common under near-calm conditions via application of new observational tools and non-standard analysis techniques.  Broader impacts will include contributions toward improved model parameterizations of surface fluxes and dispersion under weak winds conditions and improved ability to anticipate localized surface cooling associated with dense fog formation or frost damage to crops.  An existing instructional video of near-surface motions based on machine-generated fog, currently used by a number of universities in boundary-layer course work, will be expanded into a set of more professional instructional videos on local atmospheric flows for broader distribution and use.  A joint effort with a local high school will provide media suitable secondary school settings and public demonstrations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPrevious research in the boundary layer (lowest part of the atmosphere closest to the ground surface) has concentrated on relatively simple situations (steady winds, horizontal homogeneity of the surface conditions).  This approach has been justified in that substantial understanding of simple conditions has been achieved.  However, most of the Earth?s surface is not homogeneous due to common horizontal variations of vegetation and topography.  In addition, winds are generally not steady particularly under nocturnal conditions with modest or weak winds.  My work has concentrated on weak-wind nocturnal conditions when the wind direction is often quite variable and even gentle topography can substantially influence the local wind. Some of the unsteady features include wave-like motions, with a period of ten minutes to several hours, and propagating microfronts followed by colder air that typically take about 30 minutes to pass a fixed point.  These features and other transient variations of the wind strongly influence dispersion of atmospheric contaminants, minimum surface temperatures and formation of local fog.   \n\nMy work showed that attempting to modify existing theories and computer models to describe these situations will not be very successful.  I have initially explored a new line of development that includes the influence of the unsteadiness.  This approach begins by establishing a threshold wind speed, above which fluxes of heat and momentum between the ground surface and the atmosphere rapidly increase with further increases of wind speed.  These fluxes for winds weaker than the threshold speed are quite small.  \n\nThe influence of even weak topography can be large with nocturnal conditions. The vertical structure of the flow in valleys often assumes a layered form.  This structure consists of a thin layer of down-valley flow, an overlying transition layer and the regional boundary-layer flow above the valley.  In shallow valleys, the cold pool (cold air trapped at the bottom of the valley) is often only intermittent and eliminated when the wind speed exceeds a threshold value.  As a result, the valley cold pool may \"come and go\" during the course of the night.  The regional wind flows over the cold pool.  When the cold pool is eliminated, the flow into the valley follows the surface.  For an intermediate range of wind speeds, the cold pool is not completely eliminated but \"pushed\" up the slope downwind from the valley floor as depicted in the figure for terrain based on my densest network (thick solid line).  In reality, considerable structure occurs within both the cold pool (blue) and the overlying layer (pink) and this structure is often non-stationary.  For weak winds, the cold pool is centered about the valley floor.  For strong winds, the cold pool is eliminated. I found significant lee-generated turbulence with cross-valley flow at my primary site even though the valley is only 12-m deep with side slopes generally less than 5 degrees.  Consequently, the influence of common gentle topography on the local flow is significantly greater than previously thought.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Larry Mahrt"
