 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmic ray collisions in the upper atmosphere produce extensive air showers of particles which are detectable at Earth. The IceCube Observatory, a versatile particle detector at the South Pole, is a powerful tool for studying these mysterious high-energy cosmic particles. Measuring the size or energy of cosmic ray events is an important overall goal of the IceCube Observatory. Such measurements are crucial for studying any aspect of these particles, especially their energy spectrum and mass composition. The surface detectors of IceCube (known as IceTop) are covered by snow, and this attenuates the signals in the detectors. This award will enable the group to develop a reconstruction algorithm which corrects for the attenuating effect of snow coverage. In addition, this group will study the composition of cosmic rays and how the IceCube Observatory can distinguish between heavy and light cosmic ray primaries. \r\n\r\nUAA draws students from all over the state of Alaska. This project presents a unique learning opportunity for UAA undergraduates, an opportunity not only to participate in active research and discovery, but also to be a part of a large international effort.",

When cosmic rays hit the top of Earth's atmosphere, they disintegrate into showers of particle debris which are detectable here at the surface of the Earth using large detectors.  One such detector is IceTop, the surface component of the IceCube Observatory located at the South Pole.  In addition to thousands of digital \"eyeballs\" buried deep in the Antarctic ice, the IceTop detector is an array of hottub-sized tanks of frozen water spread out over an area of about 1 square kilometer.  Light sensors scan the volume of the tanks for flashes of light from cosmic rays.\n\n\nEvery time a cosmic-ray-induced shower of particles passes through IceTop, the light sensors record data about the amount of light that they saw and the time that it arrived.  We then use computer algorithms to try to reconstruct what direction it came from and how energetic it was.  The first step of this project was a complete overhaul of the software which does this reconstruction.  Next, we studied one of the most troublesome things about the IceTop detector: that snow builds up over the tanks, especially near buildings and structures.  The particles coming from the sky get attenuated in the snow; the thicker the layer of snow, the fewer particles make it through to the detectors beneath.
