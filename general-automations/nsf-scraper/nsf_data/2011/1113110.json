 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project from Symbios Technologies LLC advances a\r\nnovel plasma reactor method to oxidize organic matter in untreated water. This method has further potential to\r\ndestroy harmful substances such as pesticides, pathogens, and some inorganics. A provisional patent covering this\r\ntechnology has been filed with the U.S. Patent office. In earlier research, a proof-of-concept batch apparatus\r\ndemonstrated that this reactor could destroy selected organic compounds and pathogens. However, this early\r\nversion could not be economically scaled up nor run in a continuous mode. This Phase I project will build a new\r\napparatus design at a laboratory scale, capable of treating water continuously. Studies will then be conducted to\r\nverify the effectiveness of the new reactor design, and to investigate the mechanisms and kinetics of the\r\ndegradation of a selected organic compound.\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are: an economical and effective method to treat raw\r\nwater, input water, industrial wastewater, and contaminated potable water; and potential portability to desired\r\nlocations. There are several ongoing incidences of waterborne diseases in many parts of the world and economical\r\noptions for on-site treatment are limited. Our analytical projections indicate that it would be feasible to treat large\r\nquantities of untreated water economically on a commercial scale using a portable system. Furthermore, this\r\napparatus would be compatible with renewable energy sources and with extended applications to remote sites, such\r\nas military bases and disaster relief operations.",
