Organized by Dr. Michael S. Levine and Dr. Ida Chow from the Society for Developmental Biology (SDB) in Bethesda, Maryland, the institute will focus on a systems biology approach to understand the mechanisms of organismal evolution.  This PASI is part of a collaborative program between the SDB and the Latin American Society for Developmental Biology (LASDB) to train junior scientists on integrating bioinformatics and systems biology approaches with traditional experimentation to further our understanding of evolutionary processes.  \r\n\r\nThe increased sophistication of computational methods, whole-genome analysis, and high-resolution imaging technologies provide concrete opportunities for cross-disciplinary approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of Darwinian evolution.  Using these cutting edge tools and innovative approaches on different model and indigenous organisms, this PASI will contribute to the training of future scientists in the Americas.  Participants with different backgrounds?from computer and mathematical sciences to biology and chemistry?who are interested in evolutionary biology will be considered and the most qualified will be selected, with care to maintain diversity on training, research themes and background within the student population.  Participants will stay on (April 26-29) to attend the 6th International Meeting of the LASDB, where they will be able to present their own work to a larger international audience.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA Systems Biology Approach to Understanding Mechanisms of Organismal Evolution\n\nThe Society for Developmental Biology (SDB) is the largest society devoted to this field, with over 2200 members worldwide, including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and established investigators, many of whom hold NSF grants.  SDB has been co-organizing short courses with the Latin American Society for Developmental Biology (LASDB) in South America since 2005, satellite to LASDB\u00c6s international meetings.  Each of these short courses was held in a different country and institution, and it covered a specific theme with expert co-organizers.  Due to the uniqueness of each short course theme and the location it was held, the number of applications varied from two to four times the number of accepted students (30). \n\nThe 2012 PASI short course A Systems Biology Approach to Understanding Mechanisms of Organismal Evolution was held at the Universidad de la Rep&uacute;blica and Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Uruguay, April 16-25, 2012.  From a pool of 82 applicants 15 students were selected from USA and 15 from Latin American countries, all receiving full financial support, largely from the Pan American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) Program of the National Science Foundation (NSF).  This support was essential to allow students with all levels of financial needs and from different types of institutions to apply to the program, as selection was based on academic qualifications, interests and potential for using what is learned in the course in the students\u00c6 future careers.  We also succeeded in maintaining diversity on training, research themes and background within the student population.  The instructors were selected for their research excellence, dynamic teaching approach and willingness to continue collaborative efforts after the course, with students and other instructors.  \n\nIntellectual Merit\nThe increased sophistication of computational methods, whole-genome analysis, and high-resolution imaging technologies provide concrete opportunities for cross-disciplinary approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of Darwinian evolution.  Comparative genome analysis, along with an understanding of the impact of environmental influences and population dynamics, will spur new insights into the mechanisms underlying evolutionary novelty and diversity.  However, there is an urgent need to train investigators in the synthesis of these technologies to fully benefit from their use.  This innovative and very timely course, currently not available elsewhere, aimed in preparing future scientists in the Americas to use these cutting edge tools to investigate evolutionary processes. \n\nBroader Impact\nIn addition to learning the subject matters delivered in a supportive environment of the highest scientific quality, the future independent scientists and educators in biology and related areas had the unique opportunity to acquire first-hand experience on different cultures from daily interaction with their classmates.  Throughout the course the students (postdoctoral fellows and graduate students) and instructors had plenty opportunity for mentoring, discussion about role of science in today\u00c6s society.\n\nThe lectures were open to the campus population and interested citizens in Montevideo, making this an excellent opportunity for outreach to the non-specialists on evolution and science.  About 50-100 professors, students and staff from the local institutions attended the lectures as this was a unique opportunity for them to listen to prominent scientists in the special areas covered in the talks. \n\nFrom the post course survey this short course achieved its goals to:   \n - Train enthusiastic young investigators in the Americas to use innovative approaches and different model and indigenous organisms to broaden their knowledge base of evolutionary processes.  \n - Foster a culture of borderless collaboration among senior and junior investigators in mutually supportive..."
