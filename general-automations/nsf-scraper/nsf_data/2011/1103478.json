 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to generate a Uranium/Thorium (U/Th) dated record of rainfall in the southern tropical Pacific at sub-century (~50 year/sample) resolution for most of the glacial and Holocene periods using stalagmites from the island of Niue and from Tonga.  The speleothem from Niue dates to 83,000 years before the present.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the researchers will: 1) analyze the Niue specimen, as well as a Holocene-age stalagmite from Tonga, for Oxygen-18, Carbon-13, Magnesium/Calcium ratios, Strontium/Calcium ratios, and Barium/Calcium ratios; 2) generate a precise absolute-dated U/Th age model for the specimens; and 3) undertake drip-water sampling to validate paleoclimate interpretations. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to examine the following hypotheses: a) at times of increased Thermohaline Circulation (THC), a northward shift of the Pacific Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) dominated over a westward shift in the Walker Cell resulting in decreased rainfall at Niue; and b) rainfall records at Niue will show rapid shifts in phase with Greenland ice-core records, but will also show additional changes characteristic of Antarctic temperature records.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include the potential for a high-quality paleoclimate record from an important and under-studied region. In addition to the scientific importance and support of a graduate student, the researcher will conduct outreach through a NSF-sponsored program through which high-school students and teachers from New Jersey participate in workshops on marine and climate science.",

Our data analyses are continuing, but this important finding gives a unique and unprecedented window into South Pacific climate during the last glacial period.\n\nIn order to better interpret the connection between rainfall and the chemical composition of our stalagmite, we carried out a 2-year continuous monitoring study of the dripwater feeding our specimen and the atmosphere of the cave in which it grew.  Because the site is so remote, we had to custom design battery-powered automated sampling and sensing equipment.  Amazingly, this all worked very well, and we recently published our study outlining the mechanisms controlling the isotopic and elemental composition of the dripwater, and hence the stalagmite that precipitates layer by layer as these drops fall to the cave floor.  In a nutshell, the results tell us that the action happens above the cave: when rainfall slows, air pockets form in the cracks of the rocks overhead, allowing some calcium carbonate to deposit before reaching the stalagmite.  This alters the composition of the dripwater, leading to the chemical variations in each layer of our stalagmite.  Our island site also experiences some unique chemistry &ndash; unlike continental caves, seasalt transported by storm winds has a strong influence on the composition of the dripwater, and we must take this into accoun..."
