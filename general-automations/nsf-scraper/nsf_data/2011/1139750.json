The proposed activities include two half-day workshops, one two-hour seminar, and one career panel on the topics of; Effective Mentoring, Writing Effective Scientific Papers, the Effective Visual Communication of Data, and Making the most of Oral Presentations.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the courses is to provide expert training in an array of non-scientific tasks that are crucial to the effectiveness of scientists and educators. Many astronomers have had little or no formal training in the topics that will be covered. For researchers that are also educators these courses will help in both aspects of their careers. The courses will also increase the effectiveness of the participants in these topics which will directly promote the progress of science. In particular, the courses will likely have a large impact on young investigators and participants from underrepresented groups. The courses will be professionally evaluated to assess the impact of the sessions.",
