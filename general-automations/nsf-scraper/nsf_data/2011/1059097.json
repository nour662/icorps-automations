 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor Trevor W. Hayton at the University of California Santa Barbara to carry out fundamental studies on the synthesis and reactivity of metal ions in their highest oxidation states.  Often complexes in high oxidation states are too reactive to isolate, making their characterization and study a significant challenge.  Thus we are trying new approaches, both in terms of ligand design and synthetic methodologies, to advance the chemistry of high valent metal ions. Specifically, we are developing strongly electron donating ligands, such as the ketimide ligand, which are capable of stabilizing these oxidation states.  In a similar vein, we are developing new, broadly applicable synthetic routes for generating metal-ligand multiple bonds. To realize this latter goal we are utilizing the protection/deprotection methodology to access these novel functional groups.  \r\n\r\nThe basic research funded by this award will advance the synthetic manipulation of high oxidation state materials and provide a greater understanding of the reactivity of ions.  Many of these ions, in particular, manganese and iron, have potential applications in catalysis and artificial photosynthesis, and the information we acquire will be used in efforts to alleviate our growing energy shortage.",
