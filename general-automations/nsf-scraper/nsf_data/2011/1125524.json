 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the fieldwork and research for Thiago Chacon's doctoral dissertation on the grammar of Kubeo (Cubeo), a Tukanoan language spoken on the Uaupes (Vaup\u00e9s) River and its tributaries along the border of Brazil and Colombia. Despite having approximately 4,000 speakers, Kubeo is in critical condition. The degree of language vitality varies by location: in smaller villages, the language is transmitted to children; in larger villages, the children \"refuse\" to speak Kubeo, shifting to either Portuguese or Spanish. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this dissertation research is to provide an in-depth description of the grammar of Kubeo, with particular emphasis on the analysis of the unusual and unique linguistic traits found in this language, such as nasal harmony, unusual properties of tone, a complex system of evidentials, serial verbs, and the noun classifier system. The analysis will contribute to central issues in linguistic typology, increasing understanding of what is possible in human languages and what the limitations with regard to these linguistic features are. The dissertation also will expand knowledge of historical linguistics (language change) and language contact in this region of the Amazon, which has been of particular scientific interest. The dissertation research benefits from and contributes to the commitment of Kubeo people to document and preserve their language and cultural heritage.",
