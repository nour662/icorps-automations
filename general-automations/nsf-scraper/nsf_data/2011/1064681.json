 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scalable kinship inference in wild populations across years and generations\r\n\r\nA cornerstone of research in molecular ecology is the reconstruction of family groups (kinship analysis).\r\nUnderstanding how individuals in free-living populations are related to each other provides the best\r\nopportunity to study many important biological processes, ranging from sexual selection to patterns\r\nof dispersal and recruitment. Recent advances in molecular DNA technologies and computational\r\nmethods have made these studies possible. However, many conceptual and computational challenges\r\nremain and need to be addressed in order to advance these studies. To date, existing research work\r\non kinship analysis has primarily focused on computational methods that address a single relationship, such as parentage assignment or reconstruction of full sib groups. Inclusion of multiple objectives, such as half-sib reconstruction with minimum parentage assignment, or hierarchy over multiple generations, makes formulation of the underlying computational problem extremely challenging, and simple extensions of previous  methods do not address in a practical, scalable, and robust manner the problem of kinship reconstruction for data sets that include multiple generations of species or involve multiple optimization functions.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed research is to design robust, parsimonious, and versatile computational\r\napproaches for inferring multi-generation kinship relationships in wild populations from multiallelic\r\nmarkers. Parsimony assumption is fundamental to these approaches as it requires no prior knowledge,\r\nassumptions about sampling methodology, or existence of models, which is the case for most free-living\r\npopulations. The diverse tasks of this project include formulating computational kinship inference\r\nproblems based on existing biological studies, analyzing computational complexity of and providing\r\nsolutions to the resulting combinatorial optimization problems, and designing robust, scalable and\r\nefficient high performance implementations. The resulting computational methods will be evaluated\r\non datasets collected from existing biological studies and will be deployed to the biological community\r\nthrough the Kinalyzer web-based service, currently actively used for sibship inference only.\r\n\r\nThe research proposed in this project will greatly impact diverse application areas including funda-\r\nmental research in combinatorial optimization and data mining, and within biology, areas as diverse as\r\nbehavioral ecology, evolutionary genetics, conservation, forensics, and epidemiology. The multidisci-\r\nplinary nature of the project and the research team will enhance curriculum design of related areas and\r\nintroduce new cross-disciplinary courses. This cohesive, multidisciplinary project will provide training\r\nopportunities in biology, operation research, algorithms analysis, bioinformatics and high performance\r\ncomputing, within a single application framework. The project will leverage the diverse scientific ex-\r\npertise and extensive mentoring experience of the team to foster a true interdisciplinary collaboration\r\nand to provide a thriving environment for a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists.",
