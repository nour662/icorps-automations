This innovative shift in network monitoring addresses\r\nsevearal pervasive challenges in network traffic research: collection\r\nand storage, efficient curation, and privacy-protected sharing of large\r\nvolumes of data.\r\n\r\nCAIDA researchers are developing a taxonomy of observed traffic, including\r\nclasses of DoS attacks, vulnerability scans, and malware spread.  Such\r\na taxonomy facilitates real-time detection of events that merit more\r\ncomprehensive measurement and analysis and notification of interested\r\nresearchers. This project will also enable infrastructure for vetted\r\nresearchers to run analysis programs approximately one hour after data\r\ncollection. CAIDA has developed a privacy-sensitive data sharing framework\r\nthat integrates privacy-enhancing technology with proven and standard\r\nprivacy principles and obligations of data seekers and data providers.\r\n\r\nThe results of this project will contribute to developing early detection,\r\nreaction and mitigation strategies supporting the global fight against\r\npervasive malware.  Creation of educational data kits out of telescope\r\ndata samples will link this research to educational outcomes.  Most\r\nimportantly, this project provides convenient remote access to a wealth\r\nof data, computing resources and Internet expertise aimed at supporting\r\nnetwork security research.",
