 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to support US participants to \"An international conference on Galois representations, automorphic forms and Shimura varieties\" which will take place during June 20-23, 2011, at the National Center for Theoretical Sciences (NCTS), Hsinchu, Taiwan. The purpose of this conference is to showcase the multi-facets of Galois  representations and their inter-connections. The invited speakers include experts working on noncongruence modular forms, transcendence theory over function fields, p-adic Hodge theory, modularity of Galois representations, automorphic representations, L-functions, and  arithmetic of Shimura varieties. Recent advances in and applications of Galois representations, automorphic forms and arithmetic of Shimura varieties, from theoretical and computational aspects, will be addressed. Preceding this conference, Henri Darmon will offer a short course on \"Algebraic cycles and  p-adic deformations\" to prepare the students. Two accompanying special day activities on  noncongruence modular forms and arithmetic geometry will be held after the conference to facilitate further research oriented discussions on more focused subjects. The slides of talks  during the conference will be posted on the website of NCTS.\r\n\r\nThe research topics on Galois representations has generated a tremendous attention after Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem. Wiles' proof opened up new connections among several important areas of mathematics, from analytic and combinatorial number theory to arithmetic geometry. The topics of the conference focuses on the interaction among these topics.  It is hoped that international collaborations will be fostered through this kind of activities leading to further and deeper connections among these research fields. More information about the conference can be found at the website\r\nhttp://math.cts.nthu.edu.tw/Mathematics/GRAFSV2011.htm",
