 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research topic of this IRES program in Hong Kong is applied mathematics. Ten undergraduate students from the U.S. are selected each year to go to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) where they will collaborate with another group of ten students from Hong Kong and China.  The program solicits mathematics-related problems from industry in the area, and the students work on those problems in mixed teams of four students each. Each team has an academic mentor as well as an industrial mentor. Students are encouraged to publish their final reports. The intellectual merit of the program stems primarily from the challenging problems that are identified in an industrial setting.\r\n\r\nThis international research experience broadens the students? understanding of the world, especially East Asia, and prepares them to engage with international colleagues in the future course of their careers. The PIs makes an effort to include underrepresented minorities, and the experience encourages the participating undergraduates to appreciate research and to continue to graduate school.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), in partnership with Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), offered \"Research in Industrial Projects for Students (RIPS)-Hong Kong\" to high achieving undergraduate students.  Each year, eight U.S. students and eight Hong Kong students were chosen to work on cross-cultural teams of four students; each team\u00c6s project was sponsored by a company in Hong Kong or mainland China.\n\nProjects are selected and designed to have a major mathematical component and to pose an interesting challenge to talented undergraduates.  RIPS-Hong Kong sponsors included BGI, Hong Kong Observatory, Huawei, MetLife, Baidu, eBroker, Microsoft, and Lenovo.  The projects cover many areas of knowledge, as these examples demonstrate:\n\n\n\n\n\nBGI\n\n\n\nThe Genetic Basis for Metal Adaptation in Daphnia\n\n\n\n\n\neBroker\n\n\n\nQuantitative portfolio construction using various   optimization methods\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\n\nRobust Low-rank Matrix Factorization\n\n\n\n\n\nHKO\n\n\n\nProbabilistic radar-based nowcasting of springtime and   summer monsoonal rainstorms in Hong Kong\n\n\n\n\n\nThe students experienced first-hand the power of mathematics to solve important real-world problems that face corporations.  The students also learn how to work on a cross-cultural team, and the team\u00c6s project manager develops valuable leadership skills.   Furthermore, the program creates a network of peers that supports its members as they pursue their goals.  IPAM supports this network by maintaining a RIPS-Hong Kong Facebook group and inviting students to the annual RIPS reunion at the Joint Mathematics Meeting.\n\nDuring the program, the students learn to present the results of their research in writing and orally, which is good training for graduate school and research careers.  Additionally, most of the U.S. students presented posters of their research at the Joint Mathematics Meeting and other conferences. Several of them won outstanding presentation awards. \n\nIPAM has been offering its RIPS program in Los Angeles for 15 years.  It has been a highly successful program with loyal industrial sponsors, compelling projects, a large applicant pool (over 600 last year), and a well-established structure to support the student teams.\n\nHKUST is a suitable partner for this program because their department of mathematics boasts an exceptionally qualified faculty, 71% of whom were trained in the U.S.  The program is an example of a successful international collaboration that benefits participants on both sides and creates relationships that may lead to future collaboration.\n\nIPAM recruited and selected the U.S. students. The application process was highly competitive, with just 8% of the applicants accepted. As a result, the participants were a diverse and talented group from all types of institutions.  In the three year period of the grant, 23 students participated in the program.  48% were women, and 18% of students identified their ethnicity as Black/African American or Hispanic.\n\nOne team published an article about their project in the journal Current Bioinformatics. Another team submitted the software they developed to MLOSS (Machine Learning Open Source Software); it has been downloaded 566 times since August 2013.  Other teams are working on articles for publication as well, but due to the length of the submission and revision process, they are not available to include in this report.\n\nRIPS-Hong Kong encourages its students to pursue graduate school and research careers.  Out of the 21 students who have finished their bachelor\u00c6s degree, 14 (67%) have entered graduate school in math or a related discipline. The other nine have started jobs that use their analytical and technology skills, with titles such as product management analyst, software developer, and data scientist.  For some of the students, it is too early to predict the impact of the program on their careers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Russel E Caflisch"
