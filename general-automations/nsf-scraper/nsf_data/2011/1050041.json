 "awd_abstract_narration": "The deformational behavior of the lithospheric mantle exerts a critical effect on the strength of the tectonic plates. Whereas experimental rock deformation studies form the basis of our understanding of mantle deformation and rheology, field-based studies of exposed mantle sections are needed to investigate the rheology and deformation of naturally deformed mantle at larger spatial scales (> 10 cm). Recent field studies have illustrated complex patterns of deformation that challenge a classical homogeneous rheological model for mantle deformation. \r\n\r\nA multi-scale (cm to km), integrated approach of the processes that result in localization and deformational overprinting in lithospheric mantle, allows an assessment of mantle rheology at larger spatial scales. The Dun Mountain ophiolite belt contains multiple intact blocks of lithospheric mantle - including the Red Hills, Red Mountain, and Dun Mountain - that reveal spatial and temporal patterns of deformation in naturally deformed lithospheric mantle and elucidate fundamental processes of mantle deformation, localization, and rheology.\r\n\r\nFirst-order tectonic questions about deformation in the lithospheric mantle addressed by this research include: 1) What is the scale and extent of mantle heterogeneity?; 2) What processes result in mantle heterogeneity at different scales?; 3) Do heterogeneous fabrics result from temporally and/or spatially localized deformation?; and 4) What is the effect of heterogeneous deformation on fabric and texture preservation and magnitude?  These questions are answered with primary data on the scale and extent of mantle deformational heterogeneity including structural analyses (fabric analysis, compositional and structural domain characterization, identification of localizing or overprinting phenomena, strain analysis, estimates of effective viscosity), microstructural and textural analyses (relationship between texture and fabric in rocks with heterogeneous fabrics), and analyses of deformation processes by analyzing both intrinsic (e.g., composition, melt fraction, grain size) and extrinsic (e.g., pressure, temperature, stress, oxygen fugacity) rock characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost (lithospheric) part of the mantle is thought to be the strongest part of the tectonic plates that form the Earth?s surface.  As such, the deformational behavior of the lithospheric mantle exerts a first-order control on ongoing and ancient mountain building processes.  Portions of the lithospheric mantle are uplifted and exhumed during mountain building events and can now be found on the Earth?s surface.  These localities offer the opportunity to study mantle processes at the scales at which deformation occurs in nature.  The major question in this research is the extent to which variations in the exact proportion and orientation of different minerals in the mantle control the deformational behavior.  This work can only be done in a few places in the world with sufficient exposure; the proposed work will take place in New Zealand.  These data are critical in synthesizing results from rock deformation experiments and geophysical observations, to create realistic and predictive models of uppermost mantle deformation.\r\n\r\nThis project is a multidisciplinary collaborative effort between researchers at Texas A&M University and the University of Wisconsin. In addition to the research goals of the project, it is fostering scientific training of graduate and undergraduate students. The project also involves an international collaboration with a faculty member from the University of Otago, New Zealand.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPROJECT OUTCOME\n\nCollaborative Research: Effects of compositional heterogeneity on upper mantle deformation and rheology\n\n \n\nThe strength and behavior of the lithospheric mantle &ndash; the uppermost part of the mantle that forms the base of a tectonic plate - exerts a critical effect on the motion of tectonic plates and mountain-building processes.  Experimental rock deformation studies, carried out on cm-scale and smaller samples, form the basis of much of our understanding of mantle behavior.  This study examines lithospheric mantle rocks, now exposed at the earth\u00c6s surface as a result of mountain building, to investigate the deformation behavior of the lithospheric mantle deformed in nature and at larger spatial scales (10 cm &ndash; 100 km) than can be studied through experiments.  We studied the structures in these mantle rocks in order to characterize the behavior of deforming lithospheric mantle, and to understand the physical and chemical processes that result in the observed structures.  Our work focused on the Dun Mountain ophiolite belt, South Island, New Zealand, which contains multiple mantle exposures (Red Hills and Dun Mountain, northwest of the Alpine Fault; Red Mountain, southeast of the Alpine Fault) allowing us to investigate mantle behavior over a large spatial scale by combining information from the different bodies.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merits:\n\nOur observations of naturally deformed lithospheric mantle indicate that the different rock types that compose the lithospheric mantle exhibit fundamentally different behaviors.  The dominant rocks in the lithospheric mantle are dunite (named after Dun Mountain, New Zealand), composed of the mineral olivine, and harzburgites, containing ~15% of the mineral orthopyroxene in addition to olivine.  In general, the harzburgites exhibit shear zones, indicating that deformation localized into narrow zones, while the dunites deformed homogeneously throughout these exposures.   These mantle rocks also exhibit evidence for melt migration, particularly at the Red Hills site.  The different rock types (dunites, harzburgites, and lherzolites (containing ~5% clinopyroxene in addition to olivine and orthopyroxene) resulted from the passage of melts that removed or added pyroxene.  This melt was present while the rock mass was deforming. \n\n \n\nIn addition to investigating the behavior of the lithospheric mantle, the composition, chemistry and structures of these mantle rocks allowed us to determine the tectonic setting under which these rocks deformed.  The Dun Mountain belt formed during the initiation of subduction.  The process of subduction initiation is poorly understood, however.   Subduction zones are a unique aspect of plate tectonics, resulting from one plate overriding another plate, and are thought to control the overall plate motion of the plates at the Earth\u00c6s surface.  The structures in these mantle rocks suggest that subduction initiated in a zone that was dominated by a strike-slip plate boundary (e.g., San Andreas fault).\n\n \n\nThe identification of the tectonic setting allows us to address significant questions about the behavior of the lithospheric mantle during subduction.  Specifically, we were able to recognize that melt migration plays a fundamental role in determining the composition and behavior of the early mantle wedge (mantle region above the subducting slab) during subduction initiation. The compositional heterogeneity within the exposed mantle rocks is the end result of multiple episodes of melt movement through these rocks, occurring during the earliest stages of subduction. Thus, the exposed mantle rocks in New Zealand provide a record of how the mantle flows and changes composition as a result of melt migration during the earliest stages of subduction.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis grant supported three graduate students at Texas A&amp;M University (two of whom are now employed in the energy industry), one graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Ma..."
