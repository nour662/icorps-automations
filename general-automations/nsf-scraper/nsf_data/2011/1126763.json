This research will investigate muscle level of activation, and contact and ligament forces in normal and deficient knees during various exercises. 2) The research on movement disturbances in autism spectrum disorders will provide potentially transformative concepts on musculoskeletal biomechanics and sensorimotor control interactions of lower limb (coordination of balance and locomotion). 3) Challenge-based instruction in biomechanics will address, in a creative and\r\ntransformative way, the integration of research and education. The requested instrumentation will equip a Biomechanics Laboratory and will broaden the research scope for all participants, allowing for new scientific problems in novel and fresh directions.",
