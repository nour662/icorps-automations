 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of our Nation's systems have as components operating systems that are replete with vulnerabilities despite the best efforts of the designers to discover and fix the vulnerabilities. Building on the accomplishments of the research community, industry is attempting to create new hardware structures that can help improve security. Particularly noteworthy of these is the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip developed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), a large industry consortium that involves over 100 members. Now, many delivered processors contain TPM chips, with the goal being to provide a place to store keys, protect storage, provide code isolation attestation about the code running on a system -- all functions that can improve security. \r\n\r\nAlthough the hardware provides extremely useful and powerful security properties, researchers have been slow at adopting these techniques towards the design of secure systems. One reason is that users are not familiar with this new technology. \r\n\r\nTo remedy this situation, the PI is running annual workshops in which the developers of the TPM technology and users who have made effective use of it provided tutorial material and hands-on experiences for the workshop's participants which included students, faculty, and potential industry users. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of the workshops is to define a research program for the next decade focused around hardware support for security. This is the second workshop in the series. \r\n\r\nThese funds are used to reimburse the expenses of graduate and undergraduate students participating in the workshop, which will take place in June, 2011 in Pittsburgh.",

For fifty plus\nhours, over four and a half days, TIW participants were immersed in an\nambitious agenda, including both lectures and workshops, ranging from\nRoots of Trust in Client Devices (David Grawrock, Intel) and Mobile OS\nSecurity (Kari Kostiainen, Nokia) to Masterclass: Security Management\nand Compliance Challenges in Large Systems (Michael Donovan) and\nResearch in Attestation (Adrian Perrig, CMU, Boris Balacheff, HP,\nArial Segall, MITRE, Kari Kostiainen, Nokia).\n\nTaken as a whole, TIW 2011, TIW 2010 and TIW 2009 constituted a\nsignificant contribution to the research and knowledge of\nparticipants, and to the advancement of this vital area of research.\n\nCarnegie Mellon University CyLab provided the workshop\nfacilities. CyLab's experienced staff ensured impeccable workshop\nlogistics.  CyLab developed, launched, hosted and maintains an\nexternal workshop web site that include agenda overview, session\nabstracts, registration information, directions, sponsorship\ninformation, participant white papers, etc. In addition, CyLab hosts\nand maintains an internal web site for planning purposes.\n\nAs with the two previous conferences, TIW 2011 furthered the process\nof weaving a strong community out of numerous diverse threads in\ntrustworthy computing research. This work's potential long-term\nbenefit to the security of cyberspace could be significant, the\ntechnologies developed by those attending will, we hope, provide a\nmuch stronger level of security when combined with current systems.\nAnd as with the previous conferences, TIW 2011 was another step\nforward in establishing an infrastructure for further collaborative\nresearch between academia, industry, and government technologists,\nlinking industry's experience in the development of Trusted Computing\ntechnology and academia's IT security skills with the government's\ndesire to enhance the security of national information infrastructure.\nThroughout this project, it has been a guiding principle that research\nshould be focused on the need for secure next-generation IT\nsystems. We must do more work to bring together research stakeholders\nto discuss the state-of-the-art and future research challenges in the\narea of trusted infrastructures to outline a research program for the\nnext decade.\n\nRanging from Trusted Computing, to machine virtualization, new\nhardware architectures, and new network security architectures,\ntrusted infrastructure technologies attempt to put security into the\nvery design of commercial off-the shelf technologies. While individual\ntechnologies provide enhanced security capabilities already, the\ngreatest challenges still lie ahead in combining them in ways that\nwill enable secure, robust, and manageable trusted infrastructures to\nbecome the norm for next generation IT-systems.  Research in trusted\ninfrastructure is key to addressing those challenges, and we have\nwitnessed the incipient emergence of research activities in this area\ndevelop worldwide and across industry, government and academia\nalike. But one challenge that remains lies in the interdisciplinary\nnature of the research involved to truly advance our ability to build\nsecure, manageable and assured IT infrastructures: from distributed\nsystems to software engineering and software assurance, from hardware\narchitectures to operating systems design, from information management\nto network design, from user studies to ..."
