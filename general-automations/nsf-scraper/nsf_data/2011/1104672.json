 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern fabrication techniques have paved the way for many recent breakthroughs in electrically controlled semiconductor nanostructures with length scales on the order of tens of nanometers.  Quantum dot devices containing one or several electrons have even been employed as quantum bits.  Although these devices are highly adaptable, only a small number of quantum properties have been exploited to date as the basis for a quantum computer.  However, the number of potential quantum variables grows quickly with the number of electrons.  The aim of this project is to theoretically explore new multi-electron quantum dot configurations that may be particularly well suited for quantum computing.  Experimental designs will be considered that contain multiple electrons per quantum dot, or multiple coupled dots.  The goal is to identify quantum bits with desirable properties, in terms of control, speed or versatility.  The operation of the new quantum bits will be characterized, and their interactions with the environment will be assessed, in order to optimize quantum operations.  The identification of new high performance quantum bits will provide a blueprint for near-term experimental explorations, and for long-term, large-scale implementations.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts will involve both researchers and members of the local community. The researchers will benefit from collaborations between scientists with different types of expertise.  Graduate students will obtain a valuable range of interdisciplinary training and exposure to cutting edge research in a variety of fields.  They will also obtain valuable experience presenting and explaining their research to coworkers with varying backgrounds. The broader impacts will be further enhanced by specific outreach activities in local schools and other venues.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: The goal of this PIF project was to develop and explore novel logical qubits in quantum dots. Specifically, we identified qubits that were relatively simple to build and operate, and that yielded practical, new types of quantum gates. We focused on two families of qubits: (1) pseudo-spin qubits, and (2) distributed qubits. Pseudo-spin qubits are characterized by multiple electrons per dot, whereas distributed qubits are characterized by multiple dots per qubit.\n\nThe main product of our search was the hybrid qubit, with three electrons in a Si double quantum dot, which can be controlled completely electrically.  Compared to similar encoded qubits in a triple dot, the hybrid qubit has reduced experimental complexity and fast sub-nanosecond gating speed.  The quantum circuit made from this type of qubit is also relatively simple, and the figure of merit for gate operations is promising.\n\nIn the studies at UB our focus has been on the coherent control and decoherence of electron spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots, particularly in double and triple dots and other larger connected geometries.  We explored the effects of environmental nuclear spins, charge fluctuations, electrical disorders, and electron-phonon interactions, which give us a broad perspective on how a quantum coherent device may lose its coherent characters.  We have also gone beyond the normal equilibrium situations and investigated coherence properties of spin qubits that are out of equilibrium, such as when they are driven by an external field, or when they are transported via a moving quantum dot.\n\nOur analysis of decoherence for two-spin, three-spin, and multiple spin qubits under the influence of local nuclear spin reservoirs has started to clarify how spin decoherence scales with the system size.   Specifically, we find that decoherence for these spin qubits is highly dependent on the type of states the qubits are in.  We studied several classes of many-spin states, and find them to range from scale-free to having decoherence rate that is similar to a single-spin qubit, or proportional to the square root of the number of spins.  These are favorable observations for the long-term scalability of spin qubits in semiconductor nanostructures.\n\nBroader Impacts: The most important broader impact outcomes this past year have been (i) the training of graduate students, (ii) participation by the PI\u00c6s and students in conferences and different outreach venues, and (iii) organization of two international workshops and one KITPC (Kavli Institute of Theoretical Physics) program on electron spin qubits (with dozens of international participants from the US, Japan, Australia, and Europe) and topics on quantum decoherence and entanglement.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Xuedong Hu"
