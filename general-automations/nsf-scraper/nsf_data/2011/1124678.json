 "awd_abstract_narration": "The assembly of colloidal nano- or micro-particles into perfectly ordered periodic structures provides a basis for manufacturing photonic band gap materials and other multi-scale meta-materials with unique electric, magnetic, and optical properties.  Although proof-of-concept materials have been made in laboratories to verify their amazing properties, no existing process is yet sufficiently controllable, scalable, and robust for high-throughput manufacturing to enable commercial applications.  The fundamental limitation to assembling colloidal components into ordered structures is the complex interplay of thermal motion, interparticle interactions, and external fields that lead to defect-rich and often arrested states.  We propose a new approach to the meta-material assembly problem that combines expertise from four separate scientific fields that traditionally have had minimal interaction.  Mathematical models of the colloidal systems, represented as free energy landscapes (FELs) in a few key variables that characterize the state of the assembly process, will be constructed using data from advanced microscopic imaging and analysis tools.  The FELs will in turn be used as input to rigorous process control algorithms, developed for stochastic processes, that will navigate the landscapes to yield defect-free products. This strategy will be demonstrated and refined on prototype lab-scale reactors, using real-time digital microscopic imaging as the sensor and programmable particle-particle interaction potentials & electric fields as the actuators, to produce meta-materials.\r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impact, successful development of fundamental tools for large-scale assembly of defect-free colloidal crystals has the potential to produce revolutionary technologies (e.g. optical computing, energy harvesting, sub-diffraction limit imaging, invisibility cloaking) not unlike the creation of single crystal silicon to enable integrated circuits and modern computing. No existing processes today are capable of producing such materials at a commercial scale despite 25 years of trial-and-error efforts. A strategy of rigorous real-time control using quantitatively accurate process models, like that proposed here, is required. The education and outreach activities will incorporate integrate concepts from modeling, control, simulations, and experiments, including rich visual data from colloid experiments (e.g. images, videos) and physics-based simulations (e.g. renderings, animations) to provide intuitive education/training for students at all levels.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAll matter is made up of small components.  Atoms form molecules, and molecules form the materials that we deal with in our every day lives.  Similarly, all living beings are made of molecules, which form cells, organs, and ultimately an entire living organism.  A grand challenge of science is to understand how the properties and functions of a system (living or nonliving) emerge from its atoms and their interactions.  A grand challenge of engineering is to understand how we can manipulate matter at small length scales, in order to control the properties at the human scale in an intentional and desirable way.\n\nThis research program focused on one specific application, to uncover answers to this broader question: how to control matter at small scales to influence properties at large scales.  The specific application was the assembly of a large collection of microscale particles that are suspended in a liquid.  The movement of the particles could be influenced by pushing them toward the center by turning on the voltage.  The goal was to produce an ordered assembly of the particles, in which each particle is surrounded by exactly six particles, like a honeycomb lattice.  Ordered materials at the microscale are needed to create novel properties, such steering light to build ultra-fast circuits or invisibility cloaks.  However, the materials must have perfect order over large length scales.  Even a small number of missing or misaligned particles can destroy the ability to steer light. \n\nThe specific goal is this research program was to create a system of perfectly ordered particles by changing the level of the voltage throughout the assembly process.  In particular, by measuring the positions of each particle continuously during assembly, it was possible to adjust the voltage based on the current arrangement.  This feedback process was needed to correct defects in the crystal as they are forming.  \n\nIn general, a high voltage is needed to push the particles together into an ordered crystal arrangement.  However, by pushing hard, sometimes the particles do not have enough time to rearrange, and defects are formed.  To fix the defects, the voltage may be lowered, which allows the particles more room to rearrange.  Once the defect is fixed, then the voltage may be returned to the high level to push the particles back together toward the ordered crystal.  These explanations are qualitative, and they do not specify what is the exact level of the voltage that should be applied, and when.\n\n \n\nThe approach to control that was used here is quantitative, using a mathematical model to calculate exactly what voltage level should be used and when.  Here the objective was to create perfectly ordered crystals as rapidly as possible.  Both features are needed for the manufacturing of materials at a large scale for the creation of commercial products.  However, there is a tradeoff, since rapid assembly can lead to the formation of defects.\n\nDuring the research program we tackled our broad goal with a number of specific steps, first quantifying the level of order in a series of computational models, and then using the final model to design a feedback control policy that specifies what voltage to apply and when.  This control policy was first tested using the computational model and then finally in the experimental system.  Overall, our policy performed well at all stages, relaxing out defects only when they formed randomly, but otherwise applying a high voltage to drive rapid assembly toward the desired crystalline structure. \n\nThis research program was the first experimental demonstration of model-based feedback control for the assembly of small-scale components into a prespecified structure. It provided physical intuition on how to best adjust the voltage over time (alternating between high and low), even if no measurements are available during the assembly process.  It also provides a first step toward large-scale manufacturing of light-steering materials composed of microparticles, as well as for a broad range of nanomaterials that are ordered at small scales.\n\nThis research was conducted by a postdoctoral researcher during the first year of the grant.
