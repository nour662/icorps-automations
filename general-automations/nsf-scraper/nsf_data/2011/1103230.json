 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the early 1990s, U.S.-Mexico border enforcement efforts have pushed unauthorized migration routes into the harsh terrain of southern Arizona, thereby unintentionally causing an exponential increase in unauthorized migrant deaths in this region.  In response, humanitarian initiatives aimed at reducing unauthorized migrant deaths have been launched by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency and implemented by the U.S. Border Patrol.  Despite these efforts and decreased migration flows, migrant mortality rates continue to climb, with mortality rates increasing from 1.1 persons per 10,000 migrants to 5.5 persons per 10,000 migrants between 2000 and 2008.  Furthermore, there is a yet-to-be-explained gendered dimension of migrant mortality rates, with female migrants being 2.6 times more likely to die than male migrants.  While research has pointed to a number of factors like migration routes, jurisdictional structure, and pre-crossing conditions that influence migrant mortality rates, little is known about the institutional policies and daily practices through which humanitarian interventions are implemented by the U.S. Border Patrol and how these factors may affect the efficacy of humanitarian initiatives.  This doctoral dissertation research project will draw on scholarship in the fields of feminist and political geography to examine the gendered dimensions of the adoption and implementation of U.S. Border Patrol humanitarian initiatives in order to understand how state policies are put into practice and how they result in uneven and/or ineffective outcomes.  The doctoral student will ask the following questions:  (1) How have gender ideologies (i.e. belief systems) and discourses (i.e. systems of representation) influenced the integration of humanitarian objectives into border enforcement practices?  (2) How does the gender of unauthorized migrants in need affect the daily practices of the U.S. Border Patrol as it engages in humanitarian interventions?  A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to assess the complex ways in which gender shapes the development of state policies and their implementation.  Document and legal analysis, key informant interviews, and participant observation with governmental and non-governmental organizations will provide data on the integration of humanitarian objectives into border enforcement efforts.  A survey of Border Patrol agents in the Tucson sector will provide quantitative data on the degree to which the gender of unauthorized migrants shapes humanitarian interventions.\r\n\r\nThis project will place Border Patrol responsibilities for humanitarian assistance in context with national border enforcement objectives, thereby contributing to understandings of how states negotiate national and transnational responsibilities in the transnational era.  The project will contribute to theoretical understandings of the complex and paradoxical ways in which gender shapes state actions and their uneven effects while expanding knowledge of the process and effects of U.S.-Mexico border enforcement efforts in particular.  The migrant mortality rates in southern Arizona landscape necessitate a better understanding of humanitarian interventions if they are to be more effective.  By providing a more complete understanding of Border Patrol humanitarian efforts and their effects, this project will inform public debate and policies associated with U.S. border enforcement measures and contribute to the development of more effective border regulation policies.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.",

First, an analysis of the development of state-based humanitarian efforts to reduce migrant deaths found that one particular event&mdash;the 2003 Victoria, Texas tragedy&mdash;was key to galvanizing political attention around the issue of migrant deaths.

Based on interviews with current and retired Border Patrol agents and non-governmental humanitarian aid workers in southern Arizona, we found that before 2005, the Border Patrol\u00c6s involvement in the care of sick and injured migrants was greatly limited.  The sick and injured were most often transported to hospitals by citizen volunteers or local ambulance services,  were generally not surveilled while receiving treatment, and were discharged as any other patient upon completion of treatment.  However, since 2005 the Border Patrol has become more involved in both providing direct care and transporting sick and injured migrants. Sick and injured migrants are now under 24-hour surveillance while receiving medical care and are immediately processed for deportation upon their release from formal medical facilities.   Furthermore, the work of non-governmental humanitarian aid organizations has been greatly limited by the Border Patrol, resulting in unauthorized migrants having fewer options for receiving medical care that is not directly connected to subsequent deportation.  Interviews conducted with both Border Patrol agents and non-governmental humanitarian aid workers showed that Border Patrol agents often fail to consult non-governmental humanitarian aid workers regarding the medical status of migrants receiving care, resulting in particularly sick and/or injured migrants being processed and deported without adequate medical attention.  Interviews also found that Border Patrol policies for caring for sick and injured migrants separate family and traveling companions, resulting in sick migrants \u00e6voluntarily\u00c6 refusing treatment in order to avoid family separation.  Therefore, this research concluded that state efforts to provide care for sick and injured migrants has negative repercussions for migrant health and well-being. \n\nThis research has wide intellectual merit in the fields of political and feminist geography and interna..."
