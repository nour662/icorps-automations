The US delegation is led by Dr. Michael Triantafyllou (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and it has representation from the Naval Postgraduate School, the U. of Michigan, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Texas A&M University, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Florida Atlantic University.  The Brazilian counterparts, led by Dr. Murilo Augusto Vaz (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro), are from the Universidade de Sao Paulo, Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Rio de Janeiro, Universidade Estatal de Campinas, Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnologicas, Centro de Pesquisas e Desenvolvimento Leopoldo Am\u00e9rico Miguez de Mello, and Petrobras. \r\n\r\nBrazil has made significant investments in R&D for off-shore oil and gas drilling and thus developed considerable expertise in ocean resource extraction.  Brazil has also invested heavily in new facilities, research institutes, and university programs in ocean engineering making it a world leader in deep water oil and gas reservoirs exploration.  Brazil's investment coincides with similar efforts at US universities increasing ocean research and related education activities thus making this workshop a very timely and productive endeavor.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSUMMARY\n\nOcean engineering is  a major activity in both the USA and Brazil, encompassing offshore oil and gas extraction industries, as well as transportation using ships and naval engineering.  Ocean engineering in the US is well developed with several leading academic institutions participating.  Brazil has made substantial investments in ocean engineering as huge oil and gas fields have been discovered offshore Brazil.  As a result, a collaboration between US and Brazilian institutions could be highly beneficial for both sides.  To explore this possibility, a workshop was organized in Rio de Janeiro in August 2011, attended by academics from both countries.  The funds of the NSF project were used to partially support the travel expenses of the US participants, with matching funds provided by ONR Global and the local organizers (COPPE) in Brazil.  A group of about fifty participants from US and Brazilian academic institutions and ONR participated in the workshop, made presentations on the educational and research programs and facilities in each country and explored possibilities for collaboration and then co-authored a report for future action. Visits to Brazilian labs were organized for the participants.\n\nFollow up action includes the exchange of Brazilian students to MIT, while an Institute-wide effort at MIT to connect with Brazilian academic and research institutions is underway.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael S Triantafyllou"
