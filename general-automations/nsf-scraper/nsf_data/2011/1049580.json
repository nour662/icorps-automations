Armentrout of the University of Utah will continue work in the fields of gas-phase organometallic and biological ion chemistry and chemical dynamics. Utilizing mass spectrometric instrumentation, quantitative studies of five interrelated areas of chemical interactions will be performed: electronic state-specific chemistry of transition metal ions; solvation energies of multiply charged metal ions including those of environmental and biological importance; interactions of protons and metal ions with biologically relevant molecules; spectroscopic studies to complement the reactivity studies; and continued development of advanced means to analyze experiments on large and complex systems.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include a continued development of the experimental methods needed to obtain quantitative thermochemical data and the long-range, integrated aspects of establishing a comprehensive thermochemical database.  An evolving data analysis program is made freely available to scientific groups around the globe. Educational objectives remain a key component of this research program.  Outreach efforts include popular Christmas lectures at the University of Utah.",

The following highlights results from several specific studies.\n\nMethane is a key fossil fuel that is presently underutilized for energy production because it is difficult to transport. This problem could be solved by conversion of methane to other chemicals, e.g., methanol; however, activation of this strong C-H bond presently has no suitably efficient catalysts. It is known that several 5d (third-row) transition metal cations do activate methane at room temperature by dehydrogenation.  Such dehydrogenation reactions may be useful in the context of a hydrogen economy and related energy storage systems.  In our work, the structures of the products formed by dehydrogenation of methane by transition metal cations have been experimentally elucidated for the first time.  In contrast to most theoretical studies, a variety of structures are found including the metal carbene (MCH2+) and the hydrido metal carbyne (HMCH+).  Early metals (Ta and W) also show \"agostic\" interactions in which one of the CH bonds bends towards the metal, distorting the symmetric carbene structure.  In related studies, the mechanism and thermodynamics for methane activation by Os+ were characterized, as well as those for oxidation of Re+, Ir+, and Os+ by O2.  These latter reactions exhibited several interesting features that conventional theory does not yet understand. \n\n            Metal ions such as magnesium, calcium, and iron are biologically important to the function of certain proteins and metalloenzymes. To understand the biological transport of these metals and their impact in aqueous environments, a complete understanding of the hydration of metal(II) cations is essential.  Our work has examined how the first solvent shell of water molecules binds and how strongly, which is important in understanding the thermochemistry for delivering these metals to their active sites.  Despite the fundamental importance of such information, the present work provides some of the very first measurements of these inner solvent shell hydration energies.\n\n            Related studies examined how alkali cations, of which sodium and potassium are critical to cellular function, interact with biological molecules.  Quantitative measurements of how alkali metal cations bind to a variety of amino acids have been performed.  Comparison to theoretical calculations allows the structural motifs involved to be elucidated, which potentially provides predictive capability for understanding alkali metal cation function.  Arguably, the most important ion biologically is the proton, which is also used extensively in analytical studies that determine the amino acid sequence of proteins, important in characterizing function and analysis of disease.  Details of the mechanisms for the decomposition of protonated biological molecules in such analytical studies are generally lacking or only explored theoretically.  Ou..."
