 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometric retrieval is the problem of preprocessing multi-dimensional\r\ngeometric data for rapid access. Efficient geometric search and\r\nretrieval are of fundamental importance in engineering and science, and\r\nhave numerous applications in areas as diverse as knowledge discovery\r\nand data mining, pattern recognition and classification, machine\r\nlearning, data compression, multimedia databases, document retrieval,\r\nand statistics. Given the high complexity of exact solutions to these\r\nproblems, researchers have been led to consider these problems in the context\r\nof approximation, where small errors in distance are tolerated.\r\n\r\nOver recent years, there have been many advances in our understanding of\r\nthe computational complexity of approximation algorithms for proximity\r\nsearching. This has ranged from the development of a theory of the best\r\nspace-time tradeoffs achievable for these problems to practical software\r\nsystems. Nonetheless, there are still many important, challenging\r\nproblems that remain. Research under this award will both deepen and broaden\r\nour understanding of the computational complexity of approximate\r\nproximity searching. In particular, PI will study new data\r\nstructures for polytope membership queries, polytope-based approaches to\r\napproximate nearest neighbor searching, simplification and unification\r\nof proximity data structures, dynamic data structures for proximity\r\nsearching, and software implementations of these algorithms and data\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the contributions of new algorithms and data structures,\r\nsoftware systems and libraries will be developed as part of this\r\nresearch, which will be made freely available over the Web to help\r\nscientists and engineers in other disciplines solve their own\r\napplication problems that involve nearest neighbor and range searching.\r\nThe geometric retrieval algorithms, developed as a part of this\r\nresearch, will be incorporated into a graduate-level course in\r\ncomputational geometry. Course materials will be made available over the\r\nWeb as a resource for researchers interested in learning about this\r\narea.",
