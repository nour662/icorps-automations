 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: This collaborative research project aims to advance both scientific knowledge and synthesis of molybdenum disulfide in its atomically thin form. The research will elucidate the distinctive physical characteristics of this new material, including its electronic properties (band structure and its response to doping), optical properties (absorption, photoluminescence, and photoconductivity), vibrational properties (phonon frequencies and lifetimes), and its electrical transport properties (mobility and gating in different regimes). The principal investigators aim to develop a method for the synthesis of atomically thin MoS2 layers by a sequence of sulfur-loading of a copper surface followed by exposure to molybdenum. If successful, the research project will lead to practical methods to produce large-area samples of molybdenum disulfide in its atomically thin form and with controlled doping.\r\nNon-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The research elucidates the behavior in the single-layer limit of a semiconductor (as opposed to graphene, which is a semimetal and has no energy gap), contributes to our general understanding of materials on the nanoscale, and creates the basis for future applications of this and related material systems in electronics and optoelectronics. Graduate and undergraduate students are trained in an interdisciplinary environment. The project also promotes collaboration of scientists in two academic institutions with one of them being an accredited Minority Serving Institution.",

Growth on Cu(111) taught us the use of benzenethiol as a sulfur source and we were able to create various Mo-S-based structures with different chemical affinity (Fig. 1). Based on this, we developed a method for the growth of single-layer MoS2 on SiO2/Si(111) (Fig. 2) and extended it to a variety of different substrates.\n\nTriangular islands of MoS2, MoSe2, and WS2 (and several alloys, Fig. 3) have been grown and investigated in this project;  to this end a modified CVD growth method employing liquid organic chalcogen sources has been developed. It allows the preparation of both triangular TMD islands and extended single layer films (Fig. 2).

At UCR, this project (and an AGEP supplement) provided (female) Hispanic graduate students with research and development opportunities.\n\nUndergraduate research is an important part of this research effort. In the last project year alone, more than 12 undergraduate students were trained in the growth of the single-layer films (the photo shows the total number of undergraduate researchers between August 2013 and April 2014 (9 month) in the Bartels lab). These include Hispanic individuals. For several of them, it meant a stepping stone toward graduate education ..."
