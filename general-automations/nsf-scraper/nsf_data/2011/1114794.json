 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) installed a cabled test bed and has been operating the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) since MARS became operational November 10, 2008. The purpose of this proposal is to provide continued funding for operations and maintenance costs of MARS. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts:   \r\n\r\nThe MARS cabled test bed observatory provides a deep-water facility for testing and development and is a compelling solution for many ocean science experiments. MBARI has integrated the MARS Observatory into the Monterey Bay Aquarium 'Discovering Monterey Canyon' auditorium program as well as in the new MBARI exhibit. The Monterey Bay Aquarium has over one million visitors a year, thereby providing wide exposure for MARS and OOI to the public. The EARTH Project, a science teacher outreach effort, has used MARS as a tool at over 20 presentations to high school educators.",
