The study engages both engineering faculty and experts in informal education in looking at the long term benefits of engaging in these environments. \r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be to help explore ways to develop innovative and creative engineers that can have potentially large impact on the future engineering workforce.  The model proposed, if successful, may be broadly exportable to other institutions and engage a wide spectrum of engineering students.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.",
