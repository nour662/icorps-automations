 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is an effort to investigate the mathematical theory and \r\nalgorithms associated with the symbolic evaluation of definite \r\nintegrals. The first class of functions that will be considered is \r\nthe family of hypergeometric functions. This class is characterized \r\nby satisfying a differential equation of second order with exactly \r\nthree singular points. The PI will attempt to develop an automatic \r\nprocedure based on the Barnes representation for these functions. \r\nThe natural next step is the family of Heun functions that have four \r\nsingular points.  The project also considers many topics that have risen from previous \r\ninvestigations by the PI. These include arithmetical properties of \r\nsequences coming from the iteration of integrals, questions of logconcavity \r\nof sequences appearing in the integration of rational functions and \r\ngeneral questions on the p-adic properties of naturally occurring sequences. \r\nA general theory for these valuations will be developed.  A third component \r\nof the project is the implementation and justification of a heuristic method \r\ndeveloped by the PI and his coworkers to evaluate integrals coming from \r\nFeynman diagrams. \r\n\r\nMany problems in physics and engineering require the exact \r\nevaluation of definite integrals in terms of the parameters appearing \r\nin them. These integrals come up in the study of particle physics and \r\nclassical mechanics. While it is not always possible to find such an \r\nexpression, an efficient and robust symbolic software package should \r\ngive the result in closed-form, or decide whether such expression is \r\nachievable. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms that will \r\nexpand the capabilities of existing software packages that are \r\nwidely used in industry and universities.  A second goal is to develop \r\nmathematical theories for theoretical questions that appear in the \r\ndevelopment of the previously mentioned algorithms.",
