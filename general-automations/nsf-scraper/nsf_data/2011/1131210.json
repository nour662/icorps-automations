 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pristine fluids from a typical ridge-flank hydrothermal system have never been sampled, mainly because it has not been possible to locate a site of focused discharge where representative samples could be collected. The PIs have located a small basement feature, Dorado outcrop, on 23 m.y.-old seafloor on the eastern flank of the East Pacific Rise that they plan to sample to determine the fluid composition, and to assess the rate of discharge from the outcrop, so that they can quantify the chemical impact of this hydrothermal system. They plan an 18-day expedition that combines the surveying capabilities of the AUV Sentry (bathymetric, sub-bottom sonar, photo mosaics, water column anomalies) and an ocean-class vessel capable of collecting high-quality multi-beam data and CTD samples, and supporting the survey and sampling capabilities of the ROV Jason II for collection of spring and plume fluids, heat flow data, sediment push cores, and still and video photography. These data and samples will be combined hopefully to generate the first well-constrained estimates of hydrothermal flows from Dorado outcrop. This expedition will result in the collection of samples and data from a ?fire hose? of ridge-flank, hydrothermal system, challenging the commonly held view that discharge from ridge flank hydrothermal systems occurs primarily from diffuse seeps. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nUndergraduate and graduate students and a junior faculty member will gain experience by participating in this program. Wheat and Hulme are developing hands-on science-technology packages to engage K-8 students during week-long learning opportunities that include three technology-based activities per grade level and meet national science, mathematics, and language arts standards.",

We hypothesized that this small, extinct volcano (a \"seamount\" known as Dorado Outcrop), was a location where there was massive flow of cool (10 to 20 degC) hydrothermal water existing the ocean crust and flowing into the overlying ocean, on the order of 1,000 to 10,000 L/s. This hypothesis was made based on consideration of measurements made of the surrounding seafloor, at a water depth of 3 km, which showed that most of the heat rising from deep within the Earth below this site was missing. One explanation for the missing heat was that it was carried by seawater that flowed into the ocean crust through one seamount, then flowed for 20 km or more until it encountered another seamount that would allow the fluid to flow back out to the ocean. Other evidence supporting this hypothesis included samples of sediment and rock, collected with a surface ship and conventional coring system that suggested that Dorado Outcrop was a site of rapid hydrothermal discharge.
