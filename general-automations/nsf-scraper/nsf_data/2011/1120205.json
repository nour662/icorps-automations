 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 35 years, a robust theory of plant defenses has been developed to explain why plant species vary in the toxicity and physical toughness of their vegetative tissues. Application of this theory has broadened our understanding of plant-herbivore interactions, yielding new insights into plant ecology and evolution.  This project will now extend the theory to cover defenses of seeds against fungi in the soil.  Seeds have only a limited capacity to adjust resource acquisition and allocation to track a changing environment or to combat individual threats. Fungi that attack and can kill seeds should therefore create strong selection on suites of characteristics, or seed defense syndromes. This project will quantify the chemical and physical defenses of seeds of 18 tree species that exhibit a broad range of seed traits and germination behavior in lowland tropical forest in Panama. Experiments will determine the time course of seed survival, the efficacy of defenses at different times following dispersal onto the soil, and the ways in which particular defenses correlate with others to form syndromes of seed defensive traits. The study will offer a new perspective on the ecological and evolutionary importance of seed dormancy and a first step towards formalizing seed defense syndromes for an array of ecologically important plants. \r\n\r\nThe project will provide unique, cross-disciplinary training in tropical ecology, molecular biology, and fungal biology at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral levels and will support research and publication by students from the United States and Latin America. Research protocols and data sets will be posted on a bilingual project website, and results will be disseminated through the public outreach programs of the Mycological Herbarium of the University of Arizona.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Fungal colonization of seeds has a pervasive impact on plant population dynamics and community structure. Both natural and managed terrestrial ecosystems are influenced by this network of interactions. For example, fungal diseases of our major seed crops &ndash; rice, wheat and maize &ndash; cost global agriculture $60 billion a year in lost yield, and represent a significant threat to global food security. Nonetheless, we know remarkably little about how wild and domesticated plants defend their seeds against fungi, or how anti-fungal defenses align with other properties of seeds. In this study we tested predictions that plants defend seeds in three ways: by building physically hard seeds with an impermeable barrier to fungal colonization; by chemically defending seeds that remain permeable to water and fungi; by allowing fungi into seeds, and relying on beneficial fungi to exclude pathogenic ones. We also predicted that these defense types would be associated with differences in seed dormancy and seed survival in the soil. Physically defended seeds were predicted to survive for longest in the soil and exhibit &lsquo;physical dormancy&rsquo; (seeds can germinate only after the seed coat becomes permeable); chemically defended seeds were predicted to exhibit &lsquo;physiological dormancy&rsquo; (chemical inhibitors prevent seed germination) with varying abilities to persist in the soil, while seeds that rely on beneficial fungi were predicted to be &lsquo;non-dormant&rsquo; and to survive for relatively short periods in the soil.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These predictions were tested using 18 tree species that co-occur in tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. We selected this location because tropical trees interact with diverse microbial communities that contain fungal pathogens thought to be important in regulating population densities, and because common tree species can be found that represent all three dormancy types. We buried fresh seeds of these species at five locations on BCI, and recovered them after periods ranging from one to 30 months. For each batch of seeds recovered from the soil, we tested whether seeds were viable, we cultured and sequenced any fungi that were present in the seed interior, and we measured seed permeability, physical toughness and chemical defenses. In addition, we experimentally infected fresh seeds with fungi previously isolated from seeds to determine how fungi influenced seed survival under laboratory conditions. These lab and field experiments provided training in tropical ecology, microbial ecology and molecular biology for 10 undergraduate students, 3 graduate students, 1 laboratory technician and one post-doctoral scientist from the University of Illinois, University of Arizona and University of Panama.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We found evidence to support our proposed seed dormancy-seed defense relationships. Seeds with physical dormancy were capable of surviving for multiple years in the soil where they remained impermeable, and had low rates of fungal infection and invested little in chemical defenses. Species with physiological dormancy varied both in seed survival rates and in chemical defense investment and were frequently infected by fungi. Seeds of non-dormant species were most frequently infected by fungi, yet some seeds were capable of surviving for at least a few months, and sometimes more than two years, highlighting the potentially beneficial or protective role of fungal infections.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DNA sequence data obtained from fungal cultures grown from seeds showed that different plant species, even when buried in the same locations, are frequently infected by different species of fungi. This indicates that seed fungi are only capable of infecting a subset of plant species. Furthermore, dead seeds harbored a distinct community of fungi from live seeds, providing further evidence for the existence of both pathogenic and non-lethal, or potentially beneficial, fungal infections. Finally, when seeds were experimentally inoculated with fungi from our culture collections we found that the same fungus can have contrasting effects on different host plant species &ndash; reducing seed survival in some species, increasing survival in others. Collectively, these results highlight the important role that fungi play in determining seed fate in the soil, and the traits of seeds that influence both fungal infection and seed survival. Beyond providing new insights into how fungi might help maintain species diversity in natural ecosystems, an improved understanding of seed-fungal interactions has applications for reducing seed losses to fungi in crop plants, and to regulating weed seed populations in agricultural ecosystems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;W&nbsp;Dalling</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1120205/1120205_10126515_1480517765810_PANAMA-2012_small--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1120205/1120205_10126515_1480517765810_PANAMA-2012_small--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Seed burial on BCI\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1120205/1120205_10126515_1480517765810_PANAMA-2012_small--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Seed burial on BCI\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Project postdoc Camilo Zalamea and intern Daniel Roche measure light conditions at a seed incubation site on Barro Colorado Island, Panama</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carolina Sarmiento</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;W&nbsp;Dalling</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Seed burial on BCI</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1120205/1120205_10126515_1479499335591_Cochlospermum_inoculation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1120205/1120205_10126515_1479499335591_Cochlospermum_inoculation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cochlospermum seeds\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1120205/1120205_10126515_1479499335591_Cochlospermum_inoculation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cochlospermum seeds\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Seeds of the tree Cochlospermum vitifolium experimentally inoculated with fungi to test effects on seed germination</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carolina Sarmiento</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;W&nbsp;Dalling</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cochlospermum seeds</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1120205/1120205_10126515_1479499086726_Cecropia_insignis_2-2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1120205/1120205_10126515_1479499086726_Cecropia_insignis_2-2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cecropia insignis\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1120205/1120205_10126515_1479499086726_Cecropia_insignis_2-2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cecropia insignis\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Scanning electron micrograph of the surface of a Cecropia insignis seed</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jorge Ceballos and Camilo Zalamea</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;W&nbsp;Dalling</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cecropia insignis</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
