 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kit H. Bowen, Jr. of Johns Hopkins University is supported by an award from  the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism Program of the Chemistry Division to investigate,   with his graduate, undergraduate, and high school researchers,  a broad range of chemical topics using gas-phase, anion photoelectron spectroscopy. Systems under study include negative ions of bio-molecules, diffuse excess electron states, and species formed by electron-induced proton transfer. All of these are related to fundamental questions and issues in chemistry and related fields. The synergy between these experiments and the work of  Bowen's theoretical colleagues leads to yet deeper insight into structural, dynamical, and mechanistic aspects of these problems.\r\n\r\n\tThis research expands the frontiers of knowledge in fields as diverse as mass spectrometry, oncology, electrochemistry, analytical chemistry, enzymology, and radiation chemistry/biology. It shows us how electrons interact with molecules and collections of molecules (clusters) and how the resultant anions interact with other molecules. This work contributes strongly to the education of graduate students and undergraduates. It also provides high school students with a glimpse into scientific research.",
