 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal enables selected graduate students to attend annual professional meetings of the Society for Social Studies of Science.  This society is the central meeting place and intellectual forum for those engaged in Science and Technology Studies and it is a welcoming place for graduate students: they not only see papers, they also present, and are connected with mentors who advise them on careers and intellectual matters.  The maximum award for a graduate student is $750 for a domestic flight and $1000 for international, and all must be US students flying on US carriers.  There is a competitive selection process and the students are required to provide follow-up documentation on their experience.  This is the fourth iteration of this graduate student funding request; earlier ones have brought students  into the field who are now leaders in education and innovation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the period covered by this award, 140 graduate students were provided travel funds to attend the annual meeting of the Society for Social Studies of Science.  Individual awards ranged from a low of $40 to a high of $1,000 based on need. \n\nThe funds used to assist graduate student travel were indispensible for the attendance of many of those who received an award.  Conference participation is crucial for the intellectual and professional development of graduate students as it provides them with an opportunity to learn from their peers, to receive critical feedback on their own research, and to establish connections with others that may lead to future collaborations. In addition to providing graduate students with the financial means to attend the annual meeting, a number of these same students participated in the mentorship program at the annual meeting.  As part of the mentorship program, many graduate students receiving travel awards were paired with a faculty member at the annual meeting sharing a similar set of research interests.  This program provided them the opportunity to engage in informal scientific exchange and to receive general academic and career guidance.\n\nSeveral broader impacts have been associated with the use of NSF travel funds by graduate students.  First, conference participation is essential for the professional development of junior scholars as it provides the unique opportunity to interact with colleagues from diverse backgrounds.  Second, conference participation exposes junior scholars to innovative research, providing the intellectual ferment necessary for their intellectual maturation. Third, conference participation by graduate students increases the visibility of research coming out of the United States to a diverse and international community of scholars.  Finally, the presence of junior scholars at the annual meeting benefits the Society itself as their active participation provides the increased vigor and vitality needed to prevent intellectual stagnation within the field.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Beverly Miller"
