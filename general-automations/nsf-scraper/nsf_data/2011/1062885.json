 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three year REU Site program is to provide new and exciting summer research opportunities for undergraduate students in the field of miniature robotics. Miniature robots, defined as small robots with overall sizes between 1mm and 100mm have the potential to significantly enable or enhance capabilities in manufacturing, medicine, reconnaissance, exploration, food safety, and search and rescue. Because of their size, miniature robotics offer a truly interdisciplinary systems research challenge that encompasses materials, mechanical design, control, sensors and actuators, power, and electronics. The Maryland Robotics Center and the Institute for Systems Research at the University of Maryland (UMd)has the expertise and facilities needed to provide research opportunities to undergraduates in miniature robotics.\r\n\r\nIn this REU Site program approximately 50% of participants will be women and 30% will be underrepresented minorities. This REU Site program will focus on career and academic development of undergraduate students in addition to providing a new network of role models through a diverse mentoring pool. A more diverse group of highly educated researchers will create a larger workforce to solve the nations toughest environmental, technical, and national security challenges.",
