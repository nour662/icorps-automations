 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator works in algebraic geometry, although his interests connect to other areas of mathematics, including topology, combinatorics, physics (string theory), number theory, and symplectic and differential geometry. This proposal, continuing various strands of the investigator's work, deals with moduli spaces and related notions in a variety of settings.  In particular, the proposal deals with a number of fundamental questions regarding the moduli space of curves, Geometric Invariant Theory, topology of moduli spaces, and speculative ideas coming out of theoretical physics.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry provides a powerful theory with which to define moduli spaces of interesting objects.  Once they are defined, natural compelling questions are: what do they look like?  Are they irreducible?  Connected?  Of what dimension?  Are they smooth? If not, what singularities arise? What structure is exhibited by their cohomology rings, and why should it be geometrically expected?  What are their equations?  The investigator intends to address many of these fundamental problems in a number of cases.  The investigator has a track record of sustained and serious effort both in outreach to students at all levels (high school, undergraduate, and graduate), and in building institutions in which algebraic geometry can grow.\r\nThe investigator will continue to attract graduate students into algebraic geometry, both at Stanford and elsewhere, and to continue to nurture the careers of graduate students, post-docs, and young researchers.  The investigator will continue to work with large numbers of students at the secondary and undergraduate levels, attracting students into the mathematical sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlgebraic geometry is a field of mathematics, but more generally it is part of a point of view on mathematics, originating in France in the 1960's, which has subsumed and transformed a number of fields, including number theory, topology, geometry, and more.  One of the aspects of this point of view is the recognition that when we want to study some sort of object, we naturally see all possible such objects in one collection.  As a motivating example, if we are looking to understand lines in the plane, we often write most of them as \"y=mx+b\", where y and x and coordinates on the plane.  Then m and b are coordinates on (most of) the \"space of lines\".  Without realizing it, we are discussing the \"moduli space\" of lines --- or at least the nonvertible ones.\n\nThis project, titled \"Moduli Spaces in Algebraic Geometry\", deals with many problems of this sort, in a number of contexts.  The grant supported work which substantially moved forward the field, by resolving long-standing open questions, and opening up new avenues of investigation through the discovery of new and unexpected phenomena in nature.  \n\nFor example, the simple notion of points on a line has been something science has implicitly thought about for centuries.  It turns out that the structure of the spaces of such points has a structure that becomes simpler as soon as the number of points is at least 8, and the beautiful behavior of six points on a line is an accident.\n\nOther moduli spaces considered in this grant are the space of curves; the space of loops (universal covers); a moduli space that was originally motivated by considerations in string theory (the space of maps), and more.\n\nOne of the benefits of this grant are a number of particularly outstanding graduate students, who have since received Ph.D.'s and are well on their way to becoming leaders in mathematics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ravi Vakil"
