 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twin Cities Public Television (TPT) will lead a five-year Scale Up project to support SciGirls CONNECT, an initiative to train 100 organizations in the use of SciGirls programming. Scale-up funding will allow training, support, and the ability to engage participating projects beyond the startup year and to sustain projects into the future.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: SciGirls has grown from a small, experimental, media-based outreach effort into a national demonstration project that combines video, printed activity guides and professional development for educators, all linked through dedicated websites. All of the SciGirls components focus on a singular goal: to inspire and encourage STEM learning and participation for all girls and develop their interest in STEM careers. SciGirls programming has been tested with many different types of girl-serving organizations including PBS station outreach teams, community-based organizations and science centers, and Latina-serving organizations, including Spanish translations of SciGirls resources. The approach to SciGirls training, outreach and educational materials, is based on academic research into how to best engage girls in STEM.  Strategies are applied across all the STEM disciplines in a real-world, holistic approach, linking science with technology with engineering with math. Partner organizations are provided with SciGirls videos, Activity Guides and professional development workshops, both on-site and online. The approaches to building a larger community are based in both research and in an iterative experience working with and training past SciGirls partners.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The strength of SciGirls lies in its multimedia approach, and unique videos that model authentic STEM experiences for girls, including the new PBS SciGirls TV series.  All of the SciGirls videos provide unique, real-world role models for girls. In each video, girls see their peers using science, technology, engineering and math to answer questions about their favorite activities. STEM is no longer an abstraction; it becomes real and relevant to girls? lives. The presence of the national SciGirls TV series on PBS provides unique and powerful promotion of SciGirls CONNECT. No other program dedicated to girls and STEM has the visibility of national television broadcasts to interest girls in pursuing STEM activities. SciGirls CONNECT will build on strategic partnerships with The National Girls Collaborative Project (NGCP) and the other GSE Extension Services. The work will be guided by an advisory board of leaders in STEM programming for girls, with specialties in museums, Hispanic communities and technology.  Ultimately, the key goal of SciGirls CONNECT will be to build a vibrant community of empowered, well-informed professionals devoted to encouraging more girls to take part in STEM activities and pursue STEM careers.",

A Certified<em> SciGirls</em> Trainer provides partner organizations with an in-person training in STEM education and role model strategies, to which partners&rsquo; internal staff and other community educators are invited. With a $200 stipend and free <em>SciGirls</em> resources, trained educators develop and implement STEM programs for youth (at least 60% girls). Partner organizations have full access to <em>SciGirls </em>media, activities and ongoing support via the <em>SciGirls </em>CONNECT website, monthly webinars, quarterly newsletters and staff assistance (identifying role models for example).<strong></strong></p>\n<p>Trained educators may also apply to become Certified Trainers, and empower other regional and local educators around <em>SciGirls</em> gender equity and culturally responsive strategies. The model creates a robust and growing network of <em>SciGirls</em> practitioners.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of STEM professional women have also participated in<em> SciGirls</em> programs as role models. The <em>SciGirls Role Model Strategies Guide, </em>created in partnership with Techbridge Girls, has provided the basis for training webinars.

The majority of educators:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rated the<em> SciGirls</em> STEM activities as &ldquo;very valuable,&rdquo; noting they are adaptable, interactive, motivational and applicable to co-ed settings. </li>\n<li>Reported that the program helped build girls&rsquo; confidence, deepened their understanding of the science inquiry process, increased their awareness of science careers, and showed them that science can be fun.</li>\n<li>Shared that providing resources in Spanish helped families become advocates for and communicate about STEM learning.</li>\n<li>Said that learners increased their knowledge of and interest in STEM as a result of program participation.</li>\n<li>Found training workshops &ldquo;extremely valuable,&rdquo; and said that it changed their thinking about girls in STEM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through a supplemental award, <em>SciGirls Reflect,</em> TPT convened a cohort of 30 trainers and educators to explore their use of the <em>SciGirls Seven</em> strategies. The majority of educators reported that the quality of the <em>SciGirls </em>resources was high and that enabled engaging STEM programming.

FebFems is led by SciGirls? key national partner, the National Girls Collaborative (NGC). NGC, led by Co-PI Karen Peterson, has disseminated SciGirls resources to thousands of girl-serving programs worldwide.\n\nExpanded Programming\n\nCorporate funding has enabled TPT to leverage SciGirls CONNECT to an additional 10,500 Twin Cities children, families and educators by:\n\nTraining and providing ongoing programming to informal educators at Boys and Girls Clubs, Minneapolis Beacons Clubs and the YMCA. \nImplementing community-based STEM events at the Science Museum of Minnesota, Bakken Museum and Children?s Museum, the 3M Fair, afterschool clubs, the Minnesota State Fair and Education Minnesota (state teachers? conference). \nProviding STEM activities at TPT?s monthly \"Second Saturday\" program for kids and families.\nPartnering with TPT colleagues to produce a new episode of the local series Hands-On Science, and will create and implement CONNECT-inspired family STEM activities.\n\n\nEvaluation\n\nIn 2016, Knight Williams Inc. surveyed 1,000 educators trained in the SciGirls CONNECT practices from 2013-2015. The majority of educators:\n\nRated the SciGirls STEM activities as \"very valuable,\" noting they are adaptable, interactive, motivational and applicable to co-ed settings. \nReported that the program helped build girls? confidence, deepened their understanding of the science inquiry process, increased their awareness of science careers, and showed them that science can be fun.\nShared that providing resources in Spanish helped families become advocates for and communicate about STEM learning.\nSaid that learners increased their knowledge of and interest in STEM as a result of program participation.\nFound training workshops \"extremely valuable,\" and said that it changed their thinking about girls in STEM.\n\n\nThrough a supplemental award, SciGirls Reflect, TPT convened a cohort of 30 trainers and educators to explore their use of the SciGirls Seven strategies. The majority of educators reported that the quality of the SciGirls resources was high and that enabled engaging STEM programming. Educators valued SciGirls? research-based approach and consistently incorporated them.\n\nSciGirls evaluations are available at http://www.scigirlsconnect.org/evaluations/.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe NSF-funded SciGirls CONNECT 2 project will allow TPT to conduct a literature review of the last five years of research on gender equity and cultural responsiveness and update the SciGirls Strategies (last updated in 2013). TPT will test the updated strategies with educators, and broadly disseminate findings. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/26/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rita Karl"
