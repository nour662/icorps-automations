 "awd_abstract_narration": "The forelimbs of theropods (bipedal, predatory dinosaurs) have become greatly reduced in several different lineages, each time with vastly different results. The function, development, and evolutionary history of reduced forelimbs remains a mystery. In this project, detailed analysis of the shape and bony features (osteology) and the musculature of the arms of key theropod species will allow for identification of the most important features in the evolution of highly reduced forelimbs and how reduced forelimbs were used over time. This information will be used to examine the trends in the osteology, musculature, and overall size of the forelimb across the entire theropod family tree.\r\n\r\nThis study provides an engaging backdrop for educating the public about evolution in the context of vestigialization and the transitional stages of limb reduction (something that has happened in numerous vertebrate groups). Moreover, this project will advance understanding of the fundamental functional structure of the theropod forelimb and allows for further studies of forelimb function, such as grasping, predation, and the origin (and loss) of flight. New insights into the evolution and function of dinosaur forelimbs generated by this study will be further used for reconstructions of theropods for museum displays and educational television programs.",
