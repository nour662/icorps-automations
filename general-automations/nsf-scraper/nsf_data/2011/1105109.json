These thin, understudied insects are a lot more interesting than we thought, and their guts are able to break down compounds in their leafy diet that were previously considered unimportant in their nutrition.

Of course, exploring the many sights, sounds, and tastes of Japan on the government&rsquo;s payroll was a pleasure as well, and another good reason to apply for these foreign research fellowships.
