 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores how ecological and evolutionary processes interact to maintain species diversity in natural communities.  Classic ecological theory predicts that immigration can allow species that are poor competitors for resources to persist in natural communities, thereby maintaining regional biodiversity. However, topography, moisture, forest cover, and other landscape conditions cause variation in rates of immigration among local communities.  These landscape conditions should also influence local adaptation of species by creating variation in gene flow.  Therefore, differences in adaptation and immigration within species may be as important for understanding patterns of biodiversity as differences among species.  The goal of this project is to understand how local adaptation and competitive interactions among species are affected by variation in immigration and gene flow within species. This research will test the hypothesis that species coexistence and the resulting pattern of biodiversity in complex landscapes are products of the interactive, adaptive effects of gene flow and the demographic effects of immigration. This project will focus on two species of stream salamander for which there is much prior research on their ecological interactions, but little is known about the effects of immigration and gene flow on species coexistence.  The two study species occur together throughout the Appalachian Mountains despite a large difference in competitive ability, and previous studies have documented landscape effects on immigration and gene flow in both species. \r\n\r\nThis project will create OPEnBio: Opportunities and Perspectives in Environmental Biology, a professional career exploration program that capitalizes on the diversity of people and institutions in environmental biology in New England and the Northern Rockies.  Internships will be offered in both regions to attract American Indian undergraduates, who will get to know diverse role models and engage in a variety of approaches to research, application, and outreach.  Through related coursework and links to other diversity programs, OPEnBio will increase retention of underrepresented students, show them diverse perspectives in science, and expand the use of traditional ecological knowledge in environmental biology.",

We also marked almost 3000 salamanders to assess patterns of movement along streams. We are still working with the large amount of data collected for this project, but we have made several exciting findings so far. In an earlier study, we found that salamanders who move upstream are in better condition than those that move downstream. In this study we conducted an experiment showing that those high-condition movers are also strong competitors once they settle at an upstream site, outcompeting salamanders of the same species already at that site. That finding was exciting because it showed that how strongly individuals compete with one another can depend on where those individuals came from &ndash; nearby or far away. In the same salamander, we found that individuals who move the farthest along streams have longer front legs than most individuals in a population. But, when we put those same long-legged individuals in experimental flumes, we found that they swam slower than individuals with shorter front legs. That was surprising because we expected the long-distance movers to be the fastest swimmers. Instead, our data suggest that salamanders probably move long distances by walking &ndash; both underwater and along the edge of streams &ndash; which is more efficient with longer front legs. Those results also suggest that there is a trade-off between how far a salamander can move and how fast it can move. When salamanders need to move quickly over short distances, like to escape a predator, they swim, and longer front legs can slow them down by adding drag. Many young scientists were involved in making these and other research discoveries, including 1 post-doctoral research, 2 PhD students, 6 non-student research assistants, 15 undergraduate students, and 3 high school students. I hope that this research has also helped people appreciate the ecology of headwater streams. We have had many opportunities to show people the biodiversity of headwater streams (e.g., salamanders, insects, and fish), both by bringing people to the streams we study, and by bringing our research story to classrooms, universities, and museums.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/02/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Winsor&nbsp;H&nbsp;Lowe</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
