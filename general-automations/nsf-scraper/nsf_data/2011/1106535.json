 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important objective of the proposed research is to \r\ndevelop methods for gene mapping, i.e., the identification \r\nof genomic regions containing a gene (or genes) affecting \r\na trait of interest in either humans or in experimental organisms. \r\nSearching a parameter set for the location of one or more  \r\nsignals in a noisy background arise in gene mapping where the \r\nsignals indicate the presence of a gene. Similar problems arise \r\nin brain mapping, astronomy, and bioinformatics. An important \r\npart of their solution involves the probability that a random field  \r\nexceeds a high threshold. A unified analytic approach and \r\nsequential Monte Carlo methods will be developed to evaluate \r\nthese boundary crossing probabilities. Other methodological \r\ninnovations of the proposed research are new dynamic empirical  \r\nBayes models and methods, sequential surveillance procedures, \r\nand adaptive control schemes for input-output systems that may \r\nundergo occasional abrupt structural changes. \r\n \r\nThe dynamic empirical Bayes approach under development has \r\napplications to insurance rate-making, dynamic panel data in \r\neconomics, longitudinal data in biomedical studies, and risk \r\nmanagement. Sequential surveillance and adaptive risk control \r\nare of timely relevance in the aftermath of the recent financial \r\ncrisis and oil spill disaster. Sequential Monte Carlo methods have \r\nimportant applications to nonlinear filtering and to rare event \r\nsimulation in communication networks and risk management. Gene \r\nmapping provides an important tool in the study of human diseases, \r\nand in agriculture and animal husbandry. The broader implications \r\nof the proposed research include (i) direct implications in genetics,  \r\nengineering, finance, insurance, risk management and surveillance,  \r\nand (ii) training of the next generation of scientists in academia,  \r\nindustry, and government by developing new advanced courses and  \r\ninvolving graduate students in all phases of the research.",
