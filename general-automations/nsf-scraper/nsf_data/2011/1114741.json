 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this full-scale research and development project, Oregon State University (OSU), Oregon Sea Grant (OSG) and the Hatfield Marine Science Center Visitors Center (HMSCVC) is designing, developing, implementing, researching and evaluating a cyberlaboratory in a museum setting. The cyberlaboratory will provide three earth and marine science learning experiences with research and evaluation interwoven with visitor experiences.  The research platform will focus on: 1) a climate change exhibit that will enable research on identity, values and opinion; 2) a wave tank exhibit that will enable research on group dynamics and problem solving in interactive engineering challenges; and 3) remote sensing exhibits that will enable research on visitor interactions through the use of real data and simulations.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide the informal science educaton community with a suite of tools to evaluate learning experiences with emerging technologies using an iterative process.  The team will also make available to the informal science community their answers to the following research questions: For the climate change exhibit, \"To what extent does customizing content delivery based on real-time visitor input promote learning?\" For the wave tank exhibit, \"To what extent do opportunities to reflect on and share experiences promote STEM reasoning processes at a build-and-test exhibit?\" For the data-sensing exhibit, \"Can visitors' abilities to explain or use visualizations be improved by shaping their visual searches of images?\"  Mixed-methods using interviews, surveys, behavioral instruments, and participant observations will be used to evaluate the overall program. \r\n\r\nApproximately 60-100 informal science education professionals will discuss and test the viability of the exhibit's evaluation tools. More than 150,000 visitors, along with community members and local middle and high school students, will have the opportunity to participate in the learning experiences at the HMSCVC. This work contributes to the fields of cyberlearning and informal science education. This project provides the informal science education field with important knowledge about learning, customized content delivery and evaluation tools that are used in informal science settings.",

The Cyberlab (and its parent the FCL Lab) also demonstrated the value of integrating large scale learning sciences research efforts into the daily operations of a museum in ways that benefit both research and practice. Returns on investment for research on informal learning were proven to be high with signifiant gains for researchers working with the museum and for building research partnerships with other museums and informal STEM learning environments (e.g., Maker Faires, public exhibits, tourism in marine environments), but return on investment for museum operations and programmatic advancement were relatively minor. While the project proved that a public museum can successfully employ current video-based, cyber-linked technologies to document and study learning outside of a laboratory setting, it also demonstrated that such activity is most likely beyond the budgetary and information technology capacity of most public institutions. However, the project also piloted and provided proof of concept for smaller, mobile efforts using many of the same technologies and tools in scaled-down but efficient research and evaluation efforts. As suggested, the project established that the return on investment for research (and especially building capacity in the field for future research through education of students and professionals) of such a program is very high, but that the infrastructure and IT support costs are so high as to be out of the question for almost all public STEM venues. While because of these costs, the Cyberlab has been decommissioned from its full deployment, the project demonstrated that a mobile system could do achieve many of the same results at a fraction of the (long-term) expense. The trade off between a long-term research monitoring opportunity such as the fully deployed Cyberlab represented and the scaled-down opportunities offered by mobility remains to be documented. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> In addition to the nearly 900,000 public visitors who interacted with the five exhibit platforms constructed for the project (Touch Tanks; Wave Tanks; AR Sandtable; MultitouchTable and Wall; Spherical Display System), nearly two-dozen graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and professional evaluators engaged in professional development desinged to help them create and carry out original research or evaluation projects along with Cyberlab staff and with Cyberlab tools and data.
