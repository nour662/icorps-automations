 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to investigate the hydration mechanism of activated ground granulated blast furnace slag and fly ash for designing binder systems with improved performance. The mechanism of dissolution of slag and fly ash in alkaline medium, product phase nucleation, growth and diffusion, and interdependence of hydration of individual phases will be determined using different characterization techniques. Methods for modifying reaction kinetics of the activated binders, by influencing the type and rate of product phase nucleation will also be explored. Analytical hydration models based on nucleation and growth principles, and chemical kinetics will be developed for activated binders considering the multi-phase, multi-stage nature of hydration in these systems. The educational plan in this project is strongly integrated with research component through research integrated broader curriculum development, development of K-12 outreach program integrating proposed research, and diversity initiative through minority student recruitments.  \r\n\r\nThe research is to understand the fundamental mechanism of the reaction kinetics of slag and fly ash activated systems, and the results will promote alternative sustainable construction materials with better performance, lower CO2 foot print and lower embodied energy. It is also a crucial step toward engineering this revolutionary concrete for increased acceptance in the field. The hydration model, incorporating the effect of complexities due to multi-phase/multi-stage nature of the activated systems, will be a new development. Preparing civil engineering students as tomorrow?s technological leaders is envisioned through the proposed advancement in civil engineering curriculum.",
