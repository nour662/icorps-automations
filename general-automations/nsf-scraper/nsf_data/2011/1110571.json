 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many fields of natural science suggest that organisms both respond to and also directly regulate the physical processes that structure ecosystems, in ways that have major implications for how the current loss of Earth?s biodiversity will affect our planet. A growing number of studies incorporates the influence of organisms into our understanding of biogeochemical cycles, functioning of ecosystems, and formation of habitats. Most of these studies still consider the influence of only one species at a time, ignoring the diverse array of species that might have unique impacts. The project proposed here will explicitly ask how interactions between coexisting species influence the physical process of erosion. In this project, caddisfly (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae) diversity in experimental streams will be manipulated. Caddisflies are one of the most diverse and widespread groups of insects that live in riverbeds. They construct silken nets across pore spaces between rocks to filter feed, and previous studies have shown that nets from a single species reduce sediment motion during floods. This study will test whether multiple species of caddisfly that coexist in the same stream cause a synergistic decrease in sediment motion compared to any single species alone. \r\n\r\nPredicting sediment transport has become increasingly important in light of land-use changes, altered flow regimes, and channel-restoration efforts, and this work will help develop a better understanding of one of the most important processes in ecology and geology. Although many researchers have shown that a single biological species can have a substantial impact on abiotic processes, few studies have mechanistically explored how multiple species of animals can synergistically regulate fundamental transport processes in streams. This approach will refine our ability to quantitatively predict erosion.",

Undergraduate training: To date, this project has included five undergraduate researchers. Four of these students have performed independent research projects. Two of these students will soon finish their undergraduate degrees, while one works for the Forest Service, one works for an ecological consulting firm, and one is in graduate school.\n\n2. Public education &amp; outreach: As part of the outreach component for this grant, I volunteer at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory for children\u00c6s class programs. I help students (ages 10-15) sample and identify aquatic invertebrates in Convict Creek, which runs through the SNARL property. I also organize and play Macroinvertebrate Mayhem, a game of tag, with approximately five 6th grade classes that travel to SNARL on field trips. This game teaches students about the effects of environmental stressors like pollution and high temperatures on aquatic ..."
