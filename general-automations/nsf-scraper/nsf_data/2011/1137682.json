 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through a new HBCU Research Infrastructure in Science and Engineering award, Tuskegee University (TU) proposes to elevate its Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) program to a higher level so that its impact may considerably be broadened. The project will implement a three-part program that will \r\n\r\n(a) Enhance research capability in synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications; \r\n\r\n(b) Develop a cohort of students not only at the Ph.D. level but also at the Master's level so that they can be nurtured and motivated to continue their studies in the Ph.D. program; and \r\n\r\n(c) Provide seed funds for younger faculty members to enable them to become active in research and education in MSE. \r\n\r\nThrough earlier Center for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) and other grants funded through the National Science Foundation, Tuskegee University (TU) has developed a robust research and educational program in Materials Science and Engineering and initiated its first Ph.D. program in MSE. TU has now become the largest producer of African American PhDs in MSE. In an effort to provide sustained support for and commitment to this program, the TU administration has established the Department of MSE, which is the only department at a Historically Black University.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe proposed research activities include chemical synthesis and analysis, surface analysis, processing, and performance evaluation of a variety of nanobiomaterials. The processes and knowledge developed through this research will help in fields such as drug delivery and pharmaceutical applications. These research activities are expected to generate new knowledge about the interaction of nanoparticles with biological systems and compatibility in developing new drug delivery systems. Another outcome of this research is in developing the new multifunctional polymer composites. Implementation of a Master's degree program in MSE will allow Tuskegee to serve a larger number of students who wish to complete a Master's degree in MSE before joining the Ph.D. Program. This will also enhance the quality of students entering the Ph.D. program. Offering start-up funds to junior STEM faculty and pairing them with seasoned faculty members for effective mentoring will enable them to develop their research expertise in nanobiomaterials. \r\n\r\nBroader impact \r\nThe broader impacts of this project include production of a large number of African Americans with baccalaureate through doctorate degrees with a strong background in the emerging areas of materials science and engineering. These students will be trained to have excellent communication and interpersonal skills as well. Such graduates should become role models for many young minority students in years to come. Moreover, these graduates will help bring much-needed diversity to the Nation's advanced technological workforce. The \"Start-Up Funds for Junior Faculty\" program will address the issue of shortage of minority faculty in MSE, particularly, in nanobiomaterials science and engineering. The research findings are expected to contribute significantly to the science and technology knowledge base of nanobiomaterials. Broader societal impact includes improved capabilities in biomedical and pharmaceutical fields.",
