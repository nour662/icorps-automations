 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inclusion of 33S and 36S measurements (in addition to the more traditionally measured 32S and 34S) greatly expanded our picture of early Earth environments.  These measurements further allowed for the development of new isotopic fingerprints of specific atmospheric chemistries and biological processes. However, the advancement of this field has suffered from slow and time-intensive sample throughput, and as such, the applicability of these measurements to a wider range of Earth science related questions remains unresolved. In order to overcome these limitations, new technologies are required.  \r\n\r\nThis award will support modifications on a Thermo Scientific MAT 253 gas source mass-spectrometer, the construction and implementation of a semi-automated sample preparation-fluorination system, and salary for technical support.  This system will provide higher throughput capability in addition to being semi-automated, allowing for less person-hours per sample.  Modifications to the mass spectrometer will also allow for lower backgrounds and better precisions.  \r\n\r\nTogether, these changes will allow for the generation of larger, more precise data sets, which will in turn enable us to ask a suite of exciting new scientific questions.  Among these, areas of active research include: deciphering the contribution of different microbial processes to an overall marine isotope record and using the minor sulfur isotopes as tracers in experimental (e.g., inorganic, microbial, and animal) and natural (e.g., heavy metal contaminated sites, microbial mats) systems.\r\n",

All aspects of this proposal were fully achieved and have resulted in the generation of numerous data sets (described below) that are either in print or near submission.  IN parallel, the proposal supported the research of numerous undergraduates and the training of graduate students in biology and geology.  \n\nThe first component of the Instrument Award was aid in aquiring a Thermo Finnigan MAT 253 gas source mass spectrometer configured in dual-inlet mode for the specific measurement of 33S and 36S (as 32SF5+, 33SF5+, 34SF5+, and 36SF5+).  Specifically, the award funded modifications to the instrument that allow it to make better and more precise measurements.  The other principle component of the award was to support the construction of the fluorination line, which convert geological and biological samples into SF6.  This new design facilities very high throughput relative to other lines that serve the same function.  It is fully operational and servicing projects that range very widely.\n\nThe instrument and associated prep line have generated &gt; 2000 data points.  The first batch of data was published in PNAS in 2013 and defined a rate law for the isotopic response of sulfate reducing bacterua.  At present, we have a data set (and paper) in review with Nature  describing the oxygen and sulfur cycles in oxygen minumum zones.  In early 2014, we will submit a manuscript on the first ever enzyme specific isotope effect within the sulfur cycle.  Over the next 6 months, completed data sets on porewaters, numerous micobiological experiemnts, and geological samples will be submitted (all data sets are complete).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David T Johnston"
