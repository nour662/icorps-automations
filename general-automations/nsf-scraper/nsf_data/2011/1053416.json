 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: The research component of this CAREER award aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role that chemically inert species play in the evolution of thin films and nanostructures for the heteroepitaxial deposition of the II-VI semiconductor materials. It tests the hypothesis that an inert gas is able to induce a surfactant-like effect by kinetically disrupting adatom motion such that the thermodynamically preferred island growth mode is inhibited in favor of one that proceeds in a layer-by-layer manner. It investigates, through the use of analytical techniques and device fabrication, whether these growth modes give rise to superior material properties that are of relevance to photovoltaic applications.\r\nNon-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The fundamental research, if successful, could help further development of thin-film photovoltaic materials for energy harvesting. Education and outreach activities, geared towards the implementation of engineering solutions that promote sustainability through the use of renewable energy and nanotechnologies, will provide society with engineers equipped with the knowledge, training, and social consciousness needed to realize a sustainable urban environment.",
