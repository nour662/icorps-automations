 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to prepare 20 students in engineering disciplines admitted to Auburn University, by engaging them into variety of activities needed to successfuly complete a program of study in engineering at Auburn University. This is the second summer bridge program, as the PI has conducted the first bridge program in summer of 2010. This bridge program is to provide mentoring activities, and to enhance the engineering curricula. Academic preparation is a major focus for this summer bridge program. The program provides credit hours of english and pre-calculus courses. Time management, counselor interaction's leadership and communication skills' seminars, are also provided during this 5 weeks bridge program. At least 50% of the students are females.\r\n\r\nThe students will have an opportunity to learn about college life, how to balance their academic curricula, time management, and communication skills. The students will bond together, and help each other succeed. This bridge summer program will provide them with the gate keeper courses that they need to start a successful engineering freshman year. This program will help increasing the  students' retention from the underrepresented groups that are enrolled in engineering programs.",
