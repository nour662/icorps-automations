 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research award is to develop a new methodology that uses an availability requirement as an input to the process of determining the optimal design and management of a system.  Availability is the ability of a service or a system to be functional when it is requested for use or operation. Availability depends on an item's reliability (how often it fails) and maintainability (how efficiently it can be restored when it does fail). Availability is a significant issue for many systems including: ATM machines, point-of-sale systems, medical equipment, wind farms, military systems and airlines. For these safety, mission, and infrastructure critical systems, customers are often interested in buying the availability of a system through 'availability contracts' instead of actually buying the system itself.  This research will develop a design for availability methodology applicable to single and multiple design parameters, perform model verification, integrate the model with life cycle cost analyses, and apply the model to logistics and reliability parameters, and within Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) environments. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will provide a significant new capability to: a) perform real-time pro-active availability analysis; b) determine requirements 'flow down' to supply chains; and c) perform pro-active reliability versus logistics tradeoffs, and assess the cost and resources required to deliver and support systems subject to availability contracts. Failure to maintain the availability of systems can result in enormous costs and, in the worst cases, the loss of life. Better knowledge and design methods for planning and dealing with availability requirements during system design and management will directly impact the quality of products and systems, the safety of systems everyone depends on and reduce the costs of supporting critical infrastructure. Undergraduate, graduate and industry students will also benefit from educational modules inserted into numerous university and industry short courses.",

Availability is a function of a system\u00c6s reliability (how often it fails) and maintainability (how efficiently it can be restored when it does fail).  The objective of this project was to develop new methodologies that use an availability requirement as an input to the process of determining the optimal design of a system and the optimal design of the management of a system including its supply chain (as opposed to an availability output that is a consequence of system design, management and logistics inputs). \n\nAvailability requirements are managed (and implemented) in this project within the context of system health management technologies and how they enable informed decision making in different stages of system operation (e.g., inventory management, operation management, production decision making).  System health management refers to a family of methodologies and technologies that seek to provide advanced warning of system failures.  The advanced warning can then be used to avoid failure and/or optimize the maintenance of a system.  Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), an instantiation of system health management that uses real-time data from a system to observe the state of the system (condition monitoring) and thus determine its health.  Based on the observed health and the expected future environment stresses, PHM methods provide a prognosis for future operation of the system in the form of an estimated Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and make decisions about how the system should be managed.   The application of PHM approaches to systems directly impacts the detection of future failures, the value of preventative maintenance, and the efficiency with which failures can be diagnosed and resolved when they do occur.  All of these attributes affect the availability of systems and the use of PHM in systems is expected to improve availability.  The existence and performance of PHM in a system influences the design for availability process.\n\nThe specific outcomes of this project make significant contributions to the fields of reverse time simulation, maintenance planning and outcome-based system management:\n\nDevelopment,      verification and demonstration of a single parameter design for      availability methodology using forward time discrete event      simulation.  The single parameter      methodology has been applied to the determination of critical supply chain      parameters in systems with PHM health management.\nThe      use of Petri net backward and forward reachability analysis to create a      way to evaluate systems subject to an availability requirement.  The      Petri net approach allows us to find an optimum and flexible policy to      achieve the system requirements (e.g., availability requirements). \nUsing discrete event systems as well as Petri nets allows the simulation and      verification to go beyond the study of steady state and address the      transient outcomes as well as the impact of intermittent events.\nIntegration      of inventory modeling into an existing life-cycle model and optimization      of spare parts based on an availability requirement with correlated      failures in time.\nDemonstrated      the use of convex optimization and stochastic control theory to address planning system management with availability requirements.\nDemonstration      that availability requirements can be treated as deterministic and      probabilistic requirements, and can be defined as a time-driven factor or      as a performance-based factor.\nApplication      of the availability management concepts to maintenance optimization via the      development of the \"wait to maintain\" option (implemented after an RUL for      a system is determined) and a demonstration of its usefulness in managing      turbines in wind farms.\n\n\nThese outcomes are key to enabling contract design and optimization that co..."
