 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain deep-sea species diversity including competition, predation, physical disturbance, patch mosaics, coarse-grained environmental heterogeneity, metapopulation dynamics mediated by dispersal, and a host of abiotic factors. Evidence supporting these ideas comes largely from spatio-temporal patterns of alpha- (local) diversity. This investigator and collaborators proposed an alternative explanation based on species depth ranges. Abyssal populations of mollusks do not comprise a unique assemblage, but are mainly deeper attenuated range extensions of bathyal populations. Densities of many abyssal populations are so extraordinarily low, especially for minute organisms with low mobility and separate sexes, that it is implausible they could be reproductively viable. Most have larval dispersal ability. This suggested that many abyssal populations are maintained by source-sink dynamics. They suffer chronic local extinction from vulnerabilities to Allee effects, and persist through continued immigration from more abundant bathyal source populations. Source-sink dynamics provides a broad synthetic framework within which other potential causes of diversity (above) can act. It also resolves the long-standing paradox of how abyssal diversity could be shaped by interactions when density is so low. The theory does not require that abyssal communities be ecologically structured. They may be mostly a passive consequence of dispersal.\r\n\r\nThis project will apply two tests for source-sink dynamics: 1. The investigators will perform a direct test by examining reproductive patterns in molluscan species whose bathymetric ranges span the lower bathyal zone and the abyss. Since rare abyssal populations are predicted not to be reproductively viable, they should show diminished gamete production, and no evidence of mating. 2. They will conduct an extensive new synthesis of geographic evidence for source-sink dynamics. Geographic patterns, are currently the primary evidence available on very large spatial scales, and are invaluable for identifying taxonomic and geographical scenarios for future reproductive studies. Recent advances in nested analysis allow us to determine statistically whether abyssal communities are nested subsets of bathyal communities as predicted by source-sink theory. Newly available large datasets include Pan Atlantic distributions of gastropods, bivalves, and cumaceans from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Benthic Sampling Program; mollusks, asteroids and holothurians from Southampton Oceanography Centre's sampling program in the Porcupine Seabight and Abyssal Plains, and macrofaunal taxa from Texas A&M's Deep Gulf of Mexico Benthic Program. The investigator makes specific predictions about which groups should show geographic evidence of source-sink dynamics based on their natural history and the productivity regime. This synthesis will also contribute significantly to documenting and understanding beta diversity, the most important remaining challenge in deep-sea community ecology.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. The source-sink hypothesis has the potential to unify and synthesize the large number of disparate theories of community structure in the deep-sea benthos. The research will also dramatically increase the number of computerized datasets on biogeographic distributions. The single greatest obstacle to expanding our understanding of macroecology in the deep sea is the near absence of data on species ranges. This also has vital implications for conservation and sustainable development of the deep-sea ecosystem. Without much more information on geographic ranges, it is currently impossible to gauge the extinction potential of deep-sea species.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. At UMass-Boston, students and faculty have outstanding opportunities to be directly involved in science education and public outreach at all levels. Currently, the Biology Department has an NSF-Research Experience for Undergraduates Grant, an NIH-Initiative to Maximize Student Diversity Grant, and a NIH-Bridges to Baccalaureate Grant (with Bunker Hill and Roxbury Community Colleges). The campus has an NSF GK-12 Watershed Integrated Science Partnership 2(WISP2) Grant to upgrade high school science curricula, a McNair Grant, and a Lewis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation Grant, all oriented toward assisting underrepresented minorities. Undergraduates, graduate students and teachers will be recruited into this research program, and topics in deep-sea biology will be incorporated into university and high school curricula.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n      The deep sea (&gt;200 m in depth) is the largest ecosystem on Earth, and harbors a highly diverse unique bottom fauna. However, much of the deep ocean remains unexplored, and our understanding of the structure and function of its communities is recent and incomplete.  The deepest and most remote regions of the deep sea are the vast abyssal plains below 4000 m. Where food supply is low, abyssal plains show depressed animal abundance and species diversity. In this case, the abyssal fauna is largely a subset of the shallower bathyal fauna (&lt;4000 m) that has larval dispersal ability.  There is little abyssal endemism. We hypothesized that these impoverished abyssal assemblages were sinks maintained by source-sink dynamics; constituent species were too sparsely distributed to be reproductively viable, and were maintained by continued larval dispersal from larger bathyal source populations.  Where food supply is higher, abyssal assemblages should be more species rich and show higher endemism through adaptation to abyssal conditions.  This proposal was designed to test this by comparing species makeup and life histories of bathyal and abyssal assemblages among basins that varied in food supply from particulate organic carbon flux to the seafloor.\n\n      Our findings supported the hypothesis.  As predicted, predatory gastropods in the abyss form an ordered subset of bathyal species assemblages, and the degree of nestedness is a significant function of the proportion of species with dispersing larvae, reflecting immigration, and faunal density, reflecting extinction potential in the abyss.  In the eastern North Atlantic, where food supply and diversity remain relatively high compared to the western Atlantic, the abyssal fauna is highly endemic.  In the west, abyssal diversity is depressed and the bivalve abyssal fauna is largely a subset of the bathyal fauna.  Similarly, echinoderms in the eastern North Atlantic show high abyssal diversity and endemism.  Most compelling, polychaete worms in the impoverished western Gulf of Mexico show reduced abyssal diversity and little endemism.\n\n      The significance of these findings is that faunal diversity and composition in the deep sea are modulated by food supply.  The effect of food supply on species diversity has been recognized for some time.  The discovery that food supply also affects faunal makeup in predictable ways may lead to a more unified theory of deep-sea biodiversity.  The findings also have important implications for conservation of deep-sea species diversity and projections of future faunal change due to climate change since species diversity and composition vary with food supply.  We hope that the success of these analyses will inspire similar studies on other taxa and ocean basins to determine the generality of these biogeographic patterns.\n\n\nAll data for this study have been deposited in the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office Website (http://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/565318)\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael A Rex"
