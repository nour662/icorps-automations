The scholarships funded with this grant, coupled with student development structures that emphasize mentorship and accountability, produce students who are poised to pursue graduate programs and subsequent full-time employment. This program capitalizes on an existing graduate level program with significant industrial support. Mentoring from a diverse group of faculty and alumni promotes participation by traditionally underrepresented groups. Scholarships and degree plans reduce the time to degree completion and improve scholastic performance by increasing focus on school work. Dissemination of program outcomes of this project is to facilitate wide-spread development of similar programs.",
