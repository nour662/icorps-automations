This proposal requests funds to support 10 graduate students in the United States to attend this conference. Participated students will have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of other leading researchers in the field. This is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience. The support provided enables the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend DySPAN 2011. The project will also promote diversity by encouraging and enabling women and underrepresented minorities to participate.",
