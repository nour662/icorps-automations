Even higher resolution data are proposed for key intervals to assist in precisely defining the phasing of abrupt climate change between the hemispheres. Concurrent analysis of a suit of samples from both the WAIS Divide and GISP-2 cores throughout the last 110,000 years is also proposed, to establish the interpolar methan (CH4) gradient that will be used to identify geographic areas responsible for the climate related methane emission changes. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is that it will provide chronological control needed to examine the timing of changes in climate proxies, and critical chronological ties to the Greenland ice core records via methane variations. One main objective is to understand the interpolar timing of millennial-scale climate change. This is an important scientific goal relevant to understanding climate change mechanisms in general. The proposed work will help establish a chronological framework for addressing these issues. In addition, this proposal addresses the question of what methane sources were active during the ice age, through the work on the interpolar methane gradient. This work is directed at the fundamental question of what part of the biosphere controlled past methane variations, and is important for developing more sophisticated understanding of those variations. The broader impacts of the work are that the ultra-high resolution CH4 record will directly benefit all ice core paleoclimate research and the chronological refinements will impact paleoclimate studies that rely on ice core timescales for correlation purposes. The project will support both graduate and undergraduate students and the PIs will participate in outreach to the public.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Between 2006 an 2011, the US drilled a 3405m  (~2 miles) ice core through the West Antarctic ice sheet.  The project was sponsored by the US National Science Foundation yielding the longest U.S. ice core to date. The 12.2-centimeter (4.8-inch) diameter cylinders of ice that make up the ice core contain uniquely detailed information on past environmental conditions during the last 68,000 years.  Records such as the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, surface air temperature, wind patterns, the extent of sea ice around Antarctica are being constructed from this core with unprecedented resolution due to the high snow accumulation rate at this site.\nWorking together with Ed Brook and his colleagues at Oregon State University, we constructed the highest resolution record of atmospheric methane (CH4) covering the last 66,000 years.  Highlights from this work include the first decadal scale CH4 record covering the last 2,000 years that was used to assess the anthropogenic impact on the atmospheric CH4 budget.  Our results suggest that the broad scale CH4 increase recorded over this time is only partly due to anthropogenic activities with the majority of the signal related to climate driven changes in wetland emissions (Mitchell et al. 2013).\nOn longer timescales our CH4 record was the backbone for constructing the ice core chronology beyond 30,000 years where annual layers could be picked up in the ice core chemical records (Buizert et al. 2015).  Our CH4 record was tied to the temperature record from Greenland and the isotopic composition of Chinese cave spelothem records that were dated using radioactive decay of uranium/thorium series nuclides.  Once these three climate archives were matched in time, we were able to establish the timing of changes in the global ocean thermohaline circulation associated with the millennial scale climate oscillations that permeate the last glacial period.  Our results suggest the northern hemisphere warming and cooling episodes tend to preceed their counterparts in the southern hemisphere by ~200 years (WAIS-Divide-Project-Members and Christo Buizert* Accpeted).  This results suggests the trigger for these abrupt climate events probably has its origins in the northern hemisphere. \n \n\n \n\n \nBuizert, C., K. M. Cuffey, J. P. Severinghaus, D. Baggenstos, T.
