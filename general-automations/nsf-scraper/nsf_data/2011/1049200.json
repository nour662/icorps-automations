 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intelectual Merit. The development and application of an integrated technology-driven earth system model for community use will provide a realistic assessment of the effects of global changes on air quality, water stress, and forest carbon sequestration and nitrogen uptake during 2046-2055 relative to 2001-2010 over global, regional, and urban domains.  Results from this project has potential to help policy makers to assess current and future multiple-pollutant emission control strategies for co-benefits of climate change mitigation, air quality control, and agro-eco management.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact. The integrated earth system model will benefit the scientific community, U.S. federal and state governmental agencies, and other stakeholders and end users for both scientific research and regulatory decision analyses. Such a system has potential for far-reaching consequences for issues ranging from forecasting climate and economy change and climate change adaptation and mitigation at all scales to the promotion of global sustainable development.  The interdisciplinary nature of the research will provide a significant opportunity to train post-docs and students and broaden the pool for future scientists at the interface of energy, atmospheric chemistry, meteorology, climate, hydrology, ecology, and computer sciences.",
