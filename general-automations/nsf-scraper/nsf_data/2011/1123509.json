This project examines social-scientific journal\r\narticles, books, doctoral dissertations, and disciplinary awards to see how often each world region has\r\nbeen studied over the past half-century. The dataset that this project generates will allow us to track the\r\ntrends in scholarly attention to various parts of the world, and to test theories in the sociology of social\r\nscience about how researchers select subjects for study.\r\n\r\nThe patterns that emerge from this research will help to inform social scientists and educational policymakers about trends and possible gaps in scholarly attention to different regions of the world. The\r\ninternationalization of American higher education has been a longstanding concern in academia and in\r\npolicy circles; this work moves the debate beyond the overall level of internationalization to a more\r\ndetailed break-out of internationalization by region. The project includes a dissemination phase in order to\r\npresent the results of this research to annual meetings of national professional organizations, in order to\r\nspur discussion of the research findings and explore educational policy responses.",
