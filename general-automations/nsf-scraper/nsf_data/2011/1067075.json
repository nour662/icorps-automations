It is employed in aquaculture as a fungicide.  Permanganate reportedly dehalogenates some organic substrates, but this capability is not yet utilized in practice.  Permanganate oxidations can involve six manganese oxidation states: +II, +III, +IV, +V, +VI, +VII.  Manganese speciation and reactivity in response to ambient chemistry govern rates of substrate consumption and the identities of oxidation products.  Many permanganate oxidations are autocatalytic; an intermediate or product catalyzes forward reaction.  Better understanding of the effects of ambient chemistry on the speciation, pathways, rates, and products of permanganate oxidations would enable us to (i) accelerate permanganate oxidations, thereby improving effectiveness, and (ii) anticipate and avoid situations where oxidation products might be toxic or otherwise problematic.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research to provide the scientific/technical basis for improving the performance of permanganate oxidations.  Emerging contaminants that possess both classical sites of permanganate oxidation (e.g. alkene groups) and nonclassical sites (oxygen and nitrogen heterocycles) will be included as representative substrates.  Small changes in functional group identity and molecular structure will enable us to probe reaction mechanisms and develop structure-reactivity relationships.  Capillary electrophoresis with UV detection, and HPLC with both UV and ESI-MS/MS detection, will be used to identify and quantify reaction intermediates and products.  Autocatalysis may arise from (i) heightened substrate reactivity upon adsorption to hydrous manganese oxides (HMOs), (ii) disproportionation reactions between permanganate and lower Mn oxidation states (+II, +III, +IV) that boost Mn(V) and Mn(VI) concentrations, (iii) permanganate-substrate reactions that generate novel oxidants on surfaces or in solution.  Reagent probes, as well as exploration of pH and major ion composition effects will help resolve among possible mechanisms.  High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), combined with selective area electron diffraction (SAED) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), will be used to characterize manganese (hydr)oxide solids generated by permanganate oxidations. They will explore the intermediate oxidation state manganese species identified and quantified using capillary electrophoresis.\r\n\r\nThe unique combination of expertise in the PI's lab, i.e. inorganic reaction mechanisms, organic reaction mechanisms, and heterogeneous speciation determination, is needed to address the scientific/technical issues posed.  By improving the efficiency of permanganate oxidations, and by shedding light on permanganate oxidation product identity and yields, the proposed work will make a significant contribution to the field of water quality.\r\n\r\nThe PI's laboratory has developed several key concepts and tools in the area of metal-organic interactions in water.  Nine women and five men have completed their Ph.D. training in the PI's laboratory, including eight currently holding tenure track appointments.  The PI has helped organize outreach activities at the Rawlings Conservatory in Baltimore, and leads monthly \"Science Demonstrations\" at the Conservatory.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPermanganate is a selective oxidant deployed in one-third of U.S. water supply plants to remove iron(II) and manganese(II), taste- and odor-causing organic compounds, and cyanobacterial toxins, along with pharmaceuticals and personal care products present in treated wastewaters intended for reuse.  Permanganate use generates hydrous manganese oxide (HMO) particles that possess useful adsorption and oxidant properties.  Permanganate and HMO also oxidize natural organic matter (NOM), another common constituent of source waters.  Permanganate is usually deployed during coagulation/sedimentation, involving the creation of iron- and aluminum-containing flocs that remove pathogens and NOM as they settle.  This water treatment stage is completed within three hours, so permanganate and HMO reactions must be fast. \n\n \n\nWe have investigated about two dozen low molecular weight organic compounds that have structures representative of NOM and water constituents with undesirable properties.  For the first time a novel analytical tool, capillary electrophoresis, has been used to monitor the oxidation of these compounds by permanganate and HMO.  The ability of capillary electrophoresis to distinguish between different ionized aqueous species and quantify them is unprecedented.  A typical analysis is complete within five minutes, fast enough to capture key water treatment reactions.  For a number of our representative compounds we have managed to monitor and quantify all known oxidation products.\n\n \n\nWe have determined that very small changes in organic compound functional groups and structure can have an enormous impact on rates of reaction and the identity and yields of reaction products.  Permanganate oxidations can generate undesirable chemicals, alpha-ketocarboxylic acids and aldehydes, from benign chemicals, alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids.  Changes in water chemistry and longer contact times can, however, promote the conversion of these undesirable chemicals to innocuous carboxylic acids.\n\n \n\nOur work confirms that the dissolved redox-active metal ions iron(II) and manganese(II) can accelerate permanganate oxidations.  For the first time, dissolved aluminum(III), known to be redox inert, has been found to accelerate permanganate oxidations of some of our representative organic compounds.  This is an important finding, since aluminum salts are commonly used water treatment chemicals.\n\n \n\nResults from this work lead the way towards actively managing permanganate and HMO oxidations within water chemistry constraints of coagulation/sedimentation operations.  Structural changes to organic molecules brought about by permanganate and HMO oxidations may have consequences for downstream reactions with chlorine, chloramine, ozone, and other disinfectants.  Deployment and management of permanganate and HMO may affect which disinfection byproducts (DBPs) arrive at the tap.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan T Stone"
