 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will construct a wireless network of animal-borne embedded devices that will be deployed and tested in a biologically-relevant application. The networked devices will provide not only geo-location data, but also execute cooperative strategies that save battery-life by selectively recording bandwidth-intensive audio and high-definition video footage of occurrences of animal group behavior of interest, such as predation. \r\nThis project comprises three concurrent and interdependent research themes. The first is the investigation of methods to design and analyze the performance of distributed algorithms that implement autonomous decisions at the mobile agents, subject to communication and computational constraints. The second will pursue data-driven fundamental research on the modeling of animal group motion and will promote a formal understanding of the mechanisms of social interaction. The third is centered on the investigation of methods for hardware integration to build distributed networks of embedded devices that are capable of executing the newly developed algorithms, subject to power and weight constraints. \r\nThe results and experience gained in this project will guide the development of effective autonomous systems for the monitoring and protection of endangered species. This project will create undergraduate and graduate research opportunities at all participating institutions, expanding on an existing collaboration between the University of Maryland, Princeton University, and the National Geographic Society. There is the potential for using wide-reaching media resources to disseminate the results of this project to a broad audience. This may contribute to attracting more students to engineering and science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the last half-century, the use of animal-borne devices to study wildlife behavior and ecology has expanded immensely.  Despite impressive advances in technology, animal instrumentation remains challenging and there is a persistent demand for improvement from the research community. There is always a need for more kinds of data, better data and longer duration of data collection.  There are two key operational elements that most heavily affect these goals: available power and data collection procedures.  These  factors are strongly interconnected: ex. taking more frequent GPS readings gives fine detail of an animal?s movements but also drains the battery faster, which reduces overall tracking duration.  ?Smarter? systems can help navigate this paradox.  If the device recorded GPS fixes at a fast rate when the animal is moving and at a slower rate when it wasn?t moving, power can be conserved while collecting detailed data only when that level of detail is valuable.  The National Geographic Crittercams pose a particular challenge of this sort.  The Crittercams are animal-borne devices that combine video recording with environmental sensors.  The video provides extremely detailed behavioral and ecological information that other sensors cannot.  It also requires a great deal more power than other sensors, so being efficient with power use and determining only the ?best? time to collect this type of data is crucial. \n\nThe mesh-networking Crittercams created in this project collect more types of data than previous models but also uses these new information sources to improve operational efficiency.  Developing algorithms to process real-time data inside the animal-borne device, utilizing cutting-edge models of animal behavior, we pursued the approach of making the devices ?smarter? &ndash; to collect the data in an intelligent way and make better use the power available.  The integrated radios allow the devices to form a wireless network communicating among the devices.  With that capability, the internal decision-making processes can exploit not just what each device can sense about its own condition but also information from devices worn by other animals.  While the radio link also creates the additional capability for researchers to connect to the devices while they are on the animal &ndash; to check status, modify the settings, or pass data from distant individuals through the network to a base &ndash; the primary motivation for this feature was to enhance the internal decision making and enable more effective autonomous operations.\n\nWe also wanted to be sure our theoretical and lab-tested devices and software would work in ?real world? conditions, so ultimately the devices were put to the test by deploying them on wild animals, as part of an ongoing research program in Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique.  The Gorongosa tests resulted in significant GPS, motion and video data, as well as demonstrating that the wireless networking could function effectively under field research conditions.

Even the average distance is likely sufficient for many wildlife studies, but as this was achieved with the radios on their lowest power setting and only a tiny, internal antenna, that range could be extended if required. The data collected by the devices will be used by the researchers working there and ultimately inform the Park?s conservation and management efforts. We are already fielding requests and making plans to utilize these devices on other wildlife research projects as well as pursuing further refinement of our Crittercams based on this experience.\n\nIn this collaborative project with the University of Maryland and Princeton University, we pursued immediate, concrete applications while using the challenges of these to drive more theoretical and further-reaching developments.  While devices for studying animals may seem unrelated on the surface, the core need for sophisticated, autonomous management of power and information in these devices are shared by many other types of technology people use every day.  Feedback between animal movement models and data collected by the devices during deployments supported improvements in both.   A better understanding group animal movements &ndash; how they respond to diverse and unpredictable factors &ndash; not only improves our ability to manage and conserve these species but can also provide lessons for humans to manage our increasingly complex civilization (ex. traffic management, crowd flow).\n\nBy taking on these common challenges in an uncommon scenario, we aimed to inspire novel approaches that could apply in more human-oriented applications as well.  We?ll share these products through publication in engineering and wildlife journals that will make them available globally to those respective communities. In the process we involved more than a dozen young engineers of various specialties, providing unique and stimulating challenges to bolster their professional development.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kyler Abernathy"
