 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for Dr. Ben Cuker at Hampton University and Dr. Roger Levine of American Institutes for Research (AIR) to evaluate results of the American Society of Limnology and Oceanograhy Minority Program (ASLOMP), a program designed to increase the numbers of under-represented minorities electing careers in aquatic sciences.  The program targets minority students, faculty and professionals interested in aquatic sciences, as well as faculty working at Historically Minority Colleges and Universities (HMCU).  Participants received a free membership in ASLO and support to attend the annual meetings and special pre-meeting workshops.  \r\n\r\nAlthough results of the ASLOMP program are reported annually, this evaluation will focus on outcomes of the program over a 20 year period. Data collected by Dr. Cuker in 2010 indicates that between 1990 and 2009 there have been 1,109 student participations, comprised of 704 different students (the difference being made up by students who participated in more than one meeting). Typically 65 students participated each year. Some 80% of the students first entered the program as undergraduates, with many returning as graduate students. Overall, 232 students participated at the graduate level and 546 as undergraduates. Over the course of the program females comprised 65% of the participants but in recent years over 80%. While informal and antidotal data suggest that the program produced many excellent participants that have gone on for advanced studies and careers in the aquatic or related sciences, it is important to determine its overall  effectiveness. The longevity of the ASLOMP presents a unique opportunity to gauge its impact on the diversity of the aquatic science community. Such a study will also point to those aspects of the program that appear most important in retaining and advancing the participants in the field. Its findings will also inform others interested in advancing diversity in the sciences in general.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe National Science Foundation has supported the ASLO Multicultural Program since 1990.  ASLO is the key scientific society that deals with the sciences of limnology (freshwater) and oceanography (saltwater).  It used to stand for the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, but in 2012 changed its name to the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.  \n\nThe ASLO multicultural program was started in partnership with Hampton University with goal of improving the diversity of aquatic (water) scientists i the US.  Over 800 students haver particpated since 1990.  \n\nThis report describes the findings of a specail study supported by NSF to examine the effectiveness of ASLOMP.   The funds were used to pay for a study of participants in the program from 1990 - 2008.  The study was conducted by the American Institutes for Research.  \n\nEvaluation Findings\n\nWhat are the short-term outcomes for ASLOMP participants?\n\nParticipants felt that ASLOMP was important for increasing their self-efficacy, sense of community, professional skills, interest in aquatic sciences, knowledge about aquatic sciences, and knowledge about education and careers. Participants reported that ASLOMP was less important for increasing their knowledge about education and careers than for other short-term outcomes. \n\nWhat are the education (intermediate) and employment (long-term) outcomes of ASLOMP participants?\n\nAlmost all participants (94 percent) had earned at least a bachelor\u00c6s degree and more than half had earned a graduate degree. The majority of students had earned their highest degree in aquatic sciences or STEM fields. In addition, 26 percent of participants were in school at the time of the survey, primarily pursuing graduate degrees.Excluding current students, 92 percent of ASLOMP participants were employed and almost three quarters (73 percent) of employed participants were working in aquatic sciences or STEM fields.
