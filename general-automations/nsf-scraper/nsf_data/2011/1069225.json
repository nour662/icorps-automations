 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns free boundary surfaces, interfaces that minimize some kind of energy or cost. Two examples are the surface of least area dividing a solid into two halves of equal volume and the first nodal set, the surface where the lowest energy eigenfunction changes sign. The project considers at the same time abrupt transitions from one phase or material to another and more gradual transitions. A main goal is to study the interaction of all levels of the transition and to establish that the transition happens in the simplest possible way. The proposal suggests large-scale geometric mechanisms that cause optimizing level surfaces to resemble parallel planes at smaller scales. A second aspect of the project is to study the fluctuations of a lattice growth model known as internal diffusion-limited aggregation (internal DLA). In the limit, as the lattice size tends to zero, this process approaches a continuum free boundary evolution known as Hele-Shaw flow. In a first, key step, the principal investigator and his coauthors, Lionel Levine and Scott Sheffield, have shown that the fluctuations are closely related to the Gaussian Free Field, a random distribution in two or more dimensions that is analogous to Brownian motion in one dimension.\r\n\r\nThe interfaces treated in this proposal arise as profiles of wakes and jets, as the boundary surface between oil and water or between ice and water, and in other phase transitions in physics.  In each of those cases, the optimal shape is dictated by a physical principle. There are, moreover, examples of interfaces governed by economic principles, such as the surface where an insulating material meets the outside air, optimized to minimize the total cost of the insulating material and the energy needed to maintain a desired temperature. The probabilistic lattice model mentioned above was proposed in the 1980s by chemists Paul Meakin and John M. Deutch to describe the movement of molecules in industrial chemical processes such as electropolishing, etching, and corrosion. The fluctuations studied in this project are the very issue of concern to chemists, who want to estimate the roughness of metal surfaces at the molecular scale. In addition to conducting his own research, the principal investigator organizes and supervises graduate student mentors of undergraduates and high school students in two MIT summer programs, one of which is the internationally recognized Research Science Institute (RSI).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFree boundaries, level surfaces, and stochastic growth\n\nThis project concerned the shape of solutions to partial differential\nequations, with a focus on special level curves and level surfaces of\nthe solutions known as free boundaries.  One example of a free\nboundary is the contour of the wake of a boat; another is the\ninterface between plasma and its surroundings.\n\n\nThe PI bounded the curvature of energy-minimizing free boundary\nsurfaces, deepening the profound connection with the theory of\narea-minimizing surfaces.  He also studied free boundaries that don't\nminimize energy, including the case of plasma, and described instances\nin which the curvature tends to infinity.\n\n\nThe PI resolved a longstanding problem concerning a stochastic growth\nmodel known as internal diffusion-limited aggregation.  The model was\nproposed by chemists to describe how corrosive fluid dissolves a\nmetal.  The PI discovered how smooth the evolving metal surface is, at\nthe molecular level, and introduced a new framework for predicting\nmolecular fluctuations based on the Gaussian Free Field.\n\n\nIn previous work, the PI's collaborators discovered how to predict\nmany localized modes of vibration of a metal plate using one special\nmeasurement, namely, the response to uniform pressure.  They called\nthis response the landscape.  This project explained why the landscape\nfinds the localized modes, using energy wells and quantum tunneling.\nMoreover, the PI suggested that the landscape can also be used to find\na good approximation to the distribution of frequencies of localized\nvibrations.  This idea has been implemented by others in the design of\nLEDs.  It shortens from a day to a minute the computer time needed to\nsimulate performance of a quantum solid state model for the LED.\n\n\nThe grant supported three MIT graduate students, Nikola Kamburov,\nChenjie Fan, and Ben Yang.  The PI served as mentor and consultant to\nThomas Beck, a PhD student at Princeton University.  He supervised one\nNSF postdoctoral fellow, Eric Baer.  In the summers of 2014 and 2015,\nthe PI served as faculty advisor to over 20 research projects by\nundergraduates and over 20 projects by high school students.  He was\nprincipal designer of a MOOC in one variable calculus offered through\nEdX and MITx starting in June 2015.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David S Jerison"
