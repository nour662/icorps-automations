 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electrocaloric effect is a physical behavior where the temperature of a material changes due to the application of an electric field.  Recently it has been discovered that some ferroelectric materials exhibit a very large electrocaloric response, or \"giant\" electrocaloric effect.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop computational modeling and simulation tools to study the electrocaloric effect in ferroelectric ceramic materials. These tools will then be used to study the thermal, mechanical and electrical fields in ferroelectric materials, and to predict the performance and efficiency of cooling devices made from these materials.\r\n\r\nThe societal benefits of the proposed research stem from the fact that virtually all of the world's cooling and refrigeration technology is based upon the vapor-compression cycle of a refrigerant.  Refrigeration systems based upon the vapor-compression cycle are generally bulky given that the coolant expands into a gaseous state, require moving parts in the compressor, and in some cases have a less than optimal environmental impact.  The relatively recent discovery of the giant electrocaloric effect in ferroelectric ceramics may lead to new solid state cooling technologies that are energy efficient, reliable, portable, and environmentally friendly.  Thin film devices that utilize the electrocaloric effect could have a significant impact on refrigeration, heat pumps, air conditioning, energy scavenging, and computer cooling. The computational simulation tools developed in the proposed research program will facilitate the understanding of the fundamental thermo-electrical behavior of ferroelectrics and will aid in the design of solid state cooling devices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFerroelelectric materials have a range of novel material behaviors that respond to electrical, mechanical, and thermal stimuli.  One of the behaviors that has been investigated in this research program is what is called the giant electrocaloric effect.  This effect is linked to a phase change in the material from what is called the paraelectric phase at high temperature to the ferroelectric phase at low temperature.  Just as when liquid water freezes to ice, there is a release of latent heat as this paraelectric to ferroelectric phase change occurs.  In ferroelectric materials this phase change temperature is called the Curie temperature.  Again, just like the freezing point of water is dependent on atmospheric pressure, the Curie temperature in ferroelectric materials is also dependent on other environmental factors including mechanical stresses and applied electrical fields. \n\n \n\nThis research program is concerned with the development of theoretical models in the form of mathematical partial differential equations, and computational tools called finite element methods to simulate the complex and strongly coupled thermo-electro-mechanical behaviors in these materials.  The included figure shows the result of one such computation.  Frame (b) illustrates the phase (green = paraelectric, red/blue = ferroelectric) and domain (red = electrical polarization up, blue = electrical polarization down) structures that occur near the Curie temperature.  These calculations also allow us to interrogate the other quantities involved in the simulation, including the stresses, electric fields, and importantly the heat input/output associated with the movement of the phase boundary.\n\n \n\nIn addition to the study of the electrocaloric effect in these ferroelectric materials, the methods and techniques that have been developed in this program are also applicable to other \"smart\" materials including hydrogels (polymer networks that absorb water and swell), and shape memory alloys (metals that are deformable but \"remember\" their original shape upon heating).  Some work on these material systems was also performed during this program.  These types of field-coupled smart materials have a wide range of existing and potential applications including medical stents, sensors, actuators, energy absorption, energy harvesting, and solid state cooling devices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Chad M Landis"
