 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Barrett Lectures in Mathematics are a well known and highly regarded annual lecture series with a distinguished list of speakers over many years. The 2011 Barrett Lectures are entitled \"Recent Developments in Mathematical Relativity.\" The four-day conference is organized by the University of Tennessee's differential geometry group comprised of Professors Fernando Schwartz,  Alexandre Freire and Conrad Plaut.  During the first three days, distinguished researchers Igor Rodnianski, Richard Schoen and Robert Wald, will each deliver three hour-long survey lectures representing the three main mathematical approaches to the subject. Additionally, there will be two hour-long plenary lectures per day. During the fourth day there will be twelve half-hour talks by early-career researchers.\r\n\r\nMathematical relativity is a vast field, which has experienced major developments over the past 30 years in both its analytical and geometric aspects. These developments have had important implications for both the mathematics and physics communities.  Recent PhD recipients and graduate students are a particularly important part of the audience, and every effort will be made to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary audience.",
