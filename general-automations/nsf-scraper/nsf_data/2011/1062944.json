 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a distributed Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by K. C. Russell at Northern Kentucky University.  Besides, Northern Kentucky University, the site also includes senior researchers and their undergraduate students at Colby College, Trinity University, Macalester College, Grand Valley State University and the University of San Diego. The research projects supported in this site are focused on the study of \"theoretically interesting molecules.\"  Undergraduates will be recruited to this site primarily from local two-year colleges and other institutions without significant opportunities for undergraduate research.  The site will continue a fruitful collaboration with students and faculty from Central Connecticut State University.  The site will support twelve undergraduate research students per summer in a ten week program.  A sample of the projects that researchers will work on include:  (1)  the study of an interesting family of antiaromatic dications and dianions (Prof. Nancy Mills, Trinity University); (2)  the synthesis and characterization of push-pull [14]-annulene compounds (Prof. K. C. Russell, Northern Kentucky University) ; (3)  the synthesis and study of oxacalixarenes and poly (meta-phenelene oxides) (Prof. Jeffrey Katz, Colby College); (4) the synthesis nad characterization of hetero-boroxines and novel boroxine containing macrocycles (Prof. Peter Iovine, University of San Diego); (5) the study of Cu-catalyzed azide/alkyne click chemistry for the synthesis of novel fluorophores (Prof. Ronald Brisbois, Macalester College); and (6) the development of new multidentate chelators of Gd(III) for potential use in MRI contrast agents (Shannon Biros, Grand Valley State University).   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities.\r\n\r\nYoung scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide students without significant research experience a chance to conduct cutting-edge research in the chemical sciences with close, individual supervision by dedicated faculty mentors at these primarily undergraduate institutions.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for further study in the chemical sciences, and graduate school, with eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.",
