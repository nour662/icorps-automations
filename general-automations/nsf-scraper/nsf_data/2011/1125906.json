 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the participation of U.S.-based early career scientists and Ph.D. students at the Householder Symposium XVIII on Numerical Linear Algebra, June 12-17, 2011, at the Granlibakken Conference Center in Tahoe City, California.  The Symposium is very informal, with the intermingling of early career and established researchers a high priority. Participants are expected to attend the entire meeting. The  Householder Prize for the best thesis in numerical linear algebra since January 1, 2008 is awarded at the  meeting.  Numerical linear algebra plays a central role in scientific computing.  For the 2011 Symposium the Householder Program Committee aims for a healthy balance of theoretical, computational and applied presentations.  There is an emphasis on broad relevance, in contrast to results that are of interest only in  a narrow subfield.  Since abstract submission is only 6 months in advance of the meeting date, the Symposium always features hot research topics and emerging areas.  The organizers anticipate a large number of  submissions on the following topics: Nonlinear eigenvalue problems, tensor algorithms and analysis, domain decomposition and multilevel methods, Krylov space methods for linear systems and eigenvalue problems, algorithms for structured matrices, computation of matrix functions, randomized algorithms, as well as application to optimization, differential equations, signal and image processing, control, electronic structure calculations, data analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, and structural, mechanical and aerospace engineering. \r\n\r\nThe support of this project ensures the attendance at the meeting of well qualified applied mathematics U.S. Ph.D. students from U.S. institutions, as well as early U.S. career scientists who received their Ph.D.'s after January 1, 2008.  Support of this group will have a positive impact on the continued strong competitiveness of the U.S. in this crucial discipline, with its connections to a large number of scientific computing topics. Individual benefits for early career researchers who have attended a Householder Symposium include: career advice from established researchers, enhanced visibility in the community, ideas for REU programs, and several NSF funded research projects that arose directly from collaborations established or advice received at the Householder Symposium. Funding for participants takes into consideration the participant diversity at the meeting.",
