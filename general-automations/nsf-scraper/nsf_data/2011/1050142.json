 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit:\r\nRNA synthesis, or transcription, is the main target for regulation of gene expression in all three kingdoms of life. The RNA polymerases of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, which are responsible for RNA synthesis, are strikingly similar in structure. The aim of this research program is to gain a detailed understanding of how the RNA polymerase from the bacterium, Escherichia coli, forms a transcription-competent complex at promoter DNA, the site of initiation of RNA synthesis. Such information is vital to our detailed understanding of RNA polymerase's mechanism of action and in turn, how gene expression is regulated. In view of the similarities of their RNA polymerases, this information will be relevant to all bacteria, including pathogens.\r\n \r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThis research program affords the opportunity to maintain a strong representation of women and underrepresented minorities. To extend this to undergraduate students as well, students are recruited through the Summer Program in Undergraduate Research (SPUR) at Case Western Reserve University. This program makes it possible for students to spend ten weeks working in a research laboratory under the direction of a faculty member, culminating in the presentation of a poster in the final week. The students are provided a stipend to defray the costs of their participation.",
