The research and program activities part of this REU site are designed to help participants have a positive research and social experience, and to encourage them to pursue graduate studies and research careers. Participants are mentored by faculty from a diverse set of departments (Materials Science and Engineering, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, BioEngineering, Chemistry and Mechanical Engineering) on projects that focus on exploring the role of interfaces and surfaces on system response.\r\n\r\nAll REU students participate in two different workshop series designed to enhance their laboratory experience by focusing on (1) technical skills, specifically, materials characterization techniques and (2) professional skills and knowledge: navigation of scientific literature, laboratory documentation, and career path options. At the end of each summer program, participants will present their research results at a joint poster symposium hosted in conjunction with other Clemson REU programs.",
