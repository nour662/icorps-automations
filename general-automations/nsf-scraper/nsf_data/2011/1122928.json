Organized by Dr. Gunther Uhlmann of the Department of Mathematics at the University of California-Irvine, California, the institute will focus on leading edge techniques used in the study of inverse coefficient problems and control problems for partial differential equations (PDE).  Inverse Problems and PDE control have significant impacts on applied science and engineering including applications to stabilization, identification and design of physical systems (e.g. quantum control), image processing, mathematical finance, astronomy, geosciences, medical imaging and non-destructive evaluation of materials, among others.\r\n\r\nThis PASI will introduce students to many important techniques in the above subjects.  In addition to the exposure and mentoring of young scientists to state-of-the-art methods in inverse problems and PDE control, this PASI will foster international collaboration among researchers from the US and different countries in the Americas.  Further, cross-disciplinary efforts will be encouraged between scientists and mathematicians both from the U.S. and abroad.  The results from the PASI will be disseminated through a website where all the lectures will be available for downloading.",
