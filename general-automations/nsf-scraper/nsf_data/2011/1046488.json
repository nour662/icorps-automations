 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores advanced technologies to develop a transformative miniature batteryless wireless impedance sensor that is suitable for endoscopic implantation through the mouth and esophagus for the comfort and convenience of patients in the diagnosis and prognosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). An implantable miniature batteryless wireless device that does not require externally tethered connections and has the ability to detect acid and nonacid episodes is preferred for esophageal reflux monitoring by both patients and doctors. The proposed system consists of a miniature nanowire-based sensor which can be attached on esophagus wall for a long period of time and an external wearable reader. The impedance variations from the sensor can indicate episodes of reflux that are both acidic and non-acidic in nature. The intellectual merits in this project include the optimization of wireless power transfer efficiency for human implant applications, low-power circuitry design and miniature device fabrication/packaging, sensor surface modification with silicon nanowires, and characterization of the entire wireless sensor system.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enhance greatly the scientific and technological understanding of passive wireless communication for miniature medical implants, improve healthcare procedures, reduce healthcare costs, and enable accurate measurements for regular screening methods to prevent the occurrence of incurable esophageal cancers. The proposed system provides an innovative and practical solution for gastroesophageal reflux monitoring with advantages of batteryless operation, portable wireless communication, impedance sensing method, and miniature size enabling comfortable endoscopic implantation. With these advantages, clinicians can precisely diagnose reflux with electronic records showing quantitative data with cost-effective and out-patient procedures that can be used for large population and potentially periodic screening. With 19 million adults who have consistent reflux symptoms in US and the global aging population, the proposed system for diagnosis and prognosis will have a significant impact on healthcare procedures and costs. With improved comfort level and accuracy, the system will enable regular screening procedures in clinics which in return offer a great commercial potential with a sustainable market size. The technology development also addresses commercial potentials for applications and manufacturing of semiconductor chips in miniature medical implants and portable wireless electronics in body sensor networking",
