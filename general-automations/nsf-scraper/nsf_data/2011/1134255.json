 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Hansen, Steven and Wood, Byard D.\r\nProposal Number: 1134255\r\n\r\nState University's Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering (MAE) Senior Capstone Design Course that will design and provide innovative assistive technology solutions for the needs of persons with disabilities related to aging and that will also benefit persons of any age with disabilities. Four overarching goals drive the project's activities:\r\n1. Engage students from engineering, business, and special education & rehabilitation in developing innovative design solutions that provide assistive technologies to aging persons with disabilities\r\n2. Provide a valuable, practical, real-world capstone design experience for senior mechanical engineering students and students from other disciplines that participate\r\n3. Give students experience with the multiple design processes required to get a creative design solution from concept to the marketplace (e.g., prototype levels, human interface design and usability, manufacturability, market constraints, business plan, etc.)\r\n4. Develop a sustainable capstone design project program that extends beyond grant funding\r\nIntellectual Merit EDAAP will use MAE's Capstone Design Course to develop assistive technology devices and, ultimately, prepare them for the market place incorporating a process cycle of three one-year (two semester) development phases that include an Engineering Prototype Phase, a Manufacturing Prototype Phase, and a Market-ready Prototype Phase.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe EDAAP project will focus on creative and innovative design solutions that will enable the independence, mobility, and a level of activity to persons with the onset of progressively disabling circumstances due to the aging process. Senior engineering design students will design, build, evaluate, and prepare assistive devices for market that focus on 1) enabling independence in the home, 2) helping get people and items in/out of cars, 3) providing mobility assistance for performing tasks outdoors and in public places, and 4) providing mobility options for access to recreational activity. The project will begin with a list of 12 adaptive device student design projects submitted by EDAAP collaborators.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nKey to project success will be the integration of collaboration and multidisciplinary support from across the university as well as local and regional stakeholders including senior centers, assisted living centers, county governments, and disabilities outreach and support organizations. Academics, care providers, and users/customers of such adaptive devices will consult with student design teams and assist with both lab and in-situ testing throughout the design phases. As design projects proceed through the three phases, students from the College of Business and the College of Education and Human Services will join the design teams to evaluate products, prepare market analyses and business plans, and help ready products to proceed to the Technology Commercialization Office and manufacturers. The commercialization process will occur by licensing the right to use the IP in products or by spinning off small manufacturing companies owned in part by the university and the inventors.\r\n\r\nOutreach and Dissemination efforts grow out of the project's larger goals and focus on presentations to and activities with multidisciplinary student organizations and regional schools (including those with large Native American populations) to incorporate engineering design and assistive technologies into the classroom to create student interest and broaden student's scientific and technical foundation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "NSF Outcome Report\n\nThe Engineering Design to Aid Aging Persons (EDAAP) project was proposed to develop a formal educational design program for mechanical engineering students which focused on developing innovative assistive technology solutions for the needs of persons with disabilities related to aging.   The objectives of this project were to improve the design pedagogy used in rehabilitation engineering, create a cadre of engineering students experienced in assistive technology, and design, build and deliver innovative products to the aged population.\nThe specific objective of this project was to provide a program where significant number of engineering students real-world design projects to assist the elderly and disabled by:\n\nidentifying the product needs of the elderly and disabled on multiple projects;\nteach a design process from concept to prototype to marketplace;\nprovide a real-world capstone design experience focusing on team design;\ncreate a sustainable capstone design program which continues to address issues related to the elderly and the disabled.\n\n\nA team design procedure based on a formal review process used by NASA, the US Air Force and other organizations was implemented.   This procedure emphasizes the importance of identifying and quantifying the needs of the disabled prior to any design.  The process continues with multiple program reviews by all stakeholders, including faculty, peers, the disabled, assistive technology experts and rehabilitation experts.  The designs were built, and the prototypes were tested and evaluated based on their ability to meet the quantified needs of the disabled.\n\nThe students were divided into teams of three to eight, depending on the complexity of the problem.  A total of 24 projects focusing on projects to aid the elderly were completed by a total of 126 engineering students over a 6-year period.   The projects were completed in two semesters (34 weeks), with each student spending approximately 12 to 15 hours per week on the project.\n\nA majority of the projects focused on improving mobility.  \n\n6 projects focused on improving or expanding the performance of wheelchairs.  \n7 projects addressed mobility issues within the home, especially in rural areas.\n5 projects involved improving access to and driving automobiles.\n6 projects focused on medical rehabilitation machines or devices.\n\n\nAn example of one student project is included in the attached document.\n\nIn all cases, a product design was taken from concept to prototype, working under the joint supervision of the Mechanical Engineering (ME) department and the Center for Persons with Disabilities (CPD).  The students worked directly with either the elderly customers or with local industries supporting the disabled.  In most cases, a completed device was delivered for the use of one or more disabled or elderly customer.  Continuing support for this equipment will be provided by the CPD.\nThe results of these projects were displayed and presented at the following conferences:\n\nDevelopers Showcase, 2015 Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America (RESNA) annual conference.\nThe 2016 Assistive Technology Industry (ATIA) annual conference.  \nThe 2017 Annual ATIA conference.\nThe 2017 Annual RESNA conference.\n\nFurther, the resulting prototypes developed as part of the design program.  Of those projects:\n\n8 prototypes were delivered to a specific elderly or disabled user.\n4 prototypes will be further evaluated for future commercial development.\n5 prototypes have been developed to organizations which support activities for the disabled,\n7 projects were not continued.\n\n\nThe original proposal presented a three-year design-to-market strategy for products for the elderly and disabled.  The first year, representing a concept-to-prototype worked well.  Taking an engineering prototype to manufacturing prototype to marketable product was shown to be academically unworkable. The inability of this program to develop market-ready products resulted from:\n\ndifficulty in gaining acceptance for device funding from Medicare and Insurance companies;\nmany projects were user specific;\nlegal product liability acceptance;\na lack of manufacturing infrastructure for transition of designs from university to industry;\na lack of student entrepreneurial interest.\n\n\nAs part of this project, the entire mechanical engineering capstone design program at Utah State was successfully renovated.
