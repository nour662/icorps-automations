They will then investigate how to split traffic over harvested spectral bands to\r\nbalance the risk and reward, how to optimally utilize the spectral resource by jointly\r\ndesigning frequency allocation and routing while supporting traffic demands, and how to\r\nmaximize the throughput by joint link scheduling and routing. The proposed research\r\noutcome will lay the solid foundation for practical implementation of CRNs, which could \r\npotentially revolutionizes the way how cognitive radios should be more effectively used.\r\n\r\nThe research outcome will significantly advance the state of the art in CRNs, opening a\r\nnew avenue to designing smart living environments for public safety, disaster rescue,\r\nmobile healthcare and online social networks to improve peoples quality of life.\r\nResearch findings will be disseminated through publications and talks, and in classroom\r\nteaching. This project will also actively recruit and train minority students for future\r\nworkforce and mentor junior faculty.",
