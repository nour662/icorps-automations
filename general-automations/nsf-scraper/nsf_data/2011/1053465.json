 "awd_abstract_narration": "The combined Alleghanian-Hercynian-Variscan orogeny (approximately 300 million years ago) marks the culmination of Earth?s most recent example of the formation and dispersal of a supercontinent (Pangea). The southern Appalachian Mountains record a critical zone in the formation of Pangea because they mark the collision of the precursors of three modern continents (North America, South America, and Africa). Pangea's subsequent rupture produced these three continents and continues with the expansion of the Atlantic Ocean. The research team of faculty and students from the University of Florida and Mississippi State University are conducting detailed geochemical investigations into the spatial distribution, ages, and geochemical compositions of a suite of granitic igneous bodies that intruded crystalline rocks that formed up to one billion years earlier in the roots of the mountain belt and are now in Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and South Carolina. These granitic bodies are the only known magmatic manifestation of the destruction of two ancient oceans (Iapetus and Rheic). Understanding the age and origin of the granitic bodies is critical to understanding the growth of continents in general and, particularly, how continental crust was exchanged during the Pangean supercontinent cycle. In particular, they are focusing on identifying the boundary and the operative tectonic and magmatic processes that characterized convergence of the continents that ultimately formed Pangea. The convergent boundary has tentatively been identified on the basis of geophysical data to occur in a zone known as the Suwannee suture; the proposed suture lies sub-parallel to the Florida-Georgia border. A new boundary was established after the rupture of Pangea, which produced the modern Atlantic Ocean and the African, South American, and North American continents. The location of this rupture is not known, but is being further constrained by this project.\r\n\r\nFaculty and students (graduate and undergraduate) involved in this project are sampling the granitic rocks derived from melting of the lower continental crust as part of an integrated geochronologic, thermochronologic, and geochemical study of the spatial and temporal relationships between Alleghanian tectonism and magmatism. These data will provide unique constraints on lithospheric structure and evolution in the Pangean collision zone. The region chosen contains numerous Alleghanian magmatic rocks that intrude a range of pre-Alleghanian terranes typically considered part of ancient North America, as well as some considered to be fundamentally Gondwanan or peri-Gondwanan (e.g., African or South American). The uranium-lead zircon geochronology and isotopic composition of the granitic bodies are being used to geochemically image both sides of the proposed Suwannee suture to better understand the juxtaposition of the different continental fragments in 4-D. This \"geochemical imaging\" of lithospheric structure is: 1) providing a critical complement to on-going geophysical studies in this region that are integral to the mission of the EarthScope Program in North America, 2) providing important insight into the global tectonic enigma of largely amagmatic ocean closures, and 3) contributing to our understanding of the basement architecture of the eastern Gulf of Mexico petroleum province. The project supports an important regional scientific collaboration between researchers at the University of Florida and Mississippi State University. It is contributing to the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a STEM discipline. Because of the demographics of the student populations at both universities, it has the potential to contribute to the broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in the geosciences. The ongoing results of this research are being communicated in guidebooks, professional meeting symposia, and refereed scientific publications.\r\n\r\nThis project is being supported by the NSF Tectonics and EarthScope Programs",

Zircons (~0.1% of each sample) analyzed individually using a laser ablation system that extracted U and Pb from one or more 20-micrometer diameter spots on each crystal; the ablated material was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  A minimum of 30 zircons from each sample was analyzed.  The results define a spectrum of ages from ~295 to ~340 million years ago.  Although there was no coherent relationship between location and age, the time span of igneous activity, places an important constraint on the length of the collisional process (~45 million years).\n\n3. Whole-rock isotopic compositions of Nd and Pb were determined along with the Hf isotopic compositions of individual zircons; the Hf measurements were also made by laser ablation adjacent to the U-Pb ablation sites.  The results from all three systems were conformable, indicating that the source(s) of the granitic melts across the ~50 million year interval was in Mesoproterozoic lower continental crust, which likely formed during the Grenville orogeny ~1100 million years ago.  Previous proposals that this crust was of South American origin are not supported by our data because the pre-magmatic zircons entrained in the magmas did not produce a crustal age-profile ages that matched South American crust.\n\n4.  The thermal history of the granites was determined using 40Ar/39Ar analyses of biotite, muscovite, and hornblende.

Results from this research have been presented at numerous professional meetings by both the PIs and students.  In addition, one formal scientific report has been published and others will continue to be written as our interpretations warrant.\n\nOverall the research met its aims by determining the span of time of the granitic magmatism, that the source of the magmas was likely pre-existing North American crust, and that this North American crust was likely buried beneath African and/or South American crust as a result of the collision.  This burial was sufficiently deep that the pre-existing crust melted in some areas leading to the generation of the granites.  The distribution of deformed and undeformed rocks strongly suggests that the Pangean collision was not orthogonal, but had a significant strike-slip component (right-lateral transpressional geodynamics).\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul A Mueller"
