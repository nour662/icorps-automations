 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study nitrogen cycling in two paired, forested watersheds of the northeastern U.S.  Scientists will experimentally increase the abundance of the rare, naturally occurring, stable isotope of nitrogen (15N) to track the movement of nitrogen from precipitation through trees, microbes, soils, soil solutions and finally into streams.  This research will be carried out in two adjacent forested watersheds at the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine.  One watershed has been treated with nitrogen fertilizer for 22 years to mimic air-pollution effects on forests and streams - one of the longest studies of its kind in the world. \r\n \r\nNitrogen dynamics in forested watersheds are of intense scientific interest because nitrogen is typically the most limiting plant nutrient in land-based ecosystems.  And yet, during the last half of the 20th century, emissions of nitrogen and sulfur from fossil-fuel combustion and other sources created \"acid rain,\" causing the leaching of soil calcium and aluminum. These emissions also resulted in excess nitrogen inputs to forested watersheds, a condition referred to as nitrogen saturation, which yields increased amounts of nitrogen in streams draining forests. In the 21st century, nitrogen dynamics altered by climatic change will also influence forest health and downstream ecosystems.",

For over 25 years, one of two watersheds at BBWM (West Bear) has been treated with nitrogen and sulfur by helicopter every two months to study the effects of acid deposition and a changing climate on watershed processes. This grant supported the experimental addition of a stable isotope, 15-N, to both the reference (East Bear) and treated watersheds as a tool to study nitrogen cycling in these side-by-side watersheds, one with decades of experimental chemical manipulation resulting in ecosystem acidification and greater nitrogen. This research is critical to study ecosystem changes on multi-decadal time scales in response to a changing chemical and physical climate. The emerging findings enhance our understanding of the implications for acid rain, early recovery from declining air pollutant deposition, and a changing climate as it relates to forested landscapes and their surface waters in the northeastern U.S.</p>\n<p>In June of 2012, a team of faculty, technicians, and both graduate and undergraduate students spent 8 days applying a one-time treatment to the two forested watersheds with backpack sprayers. We added a tiny amount of total nitrogen that contained a relatively large amount of the 15-N tracer compared to what is found in nature, over a total of about 25 acres. Researchers then began to study the movement of the stable isotope form of nitrogen into soils, ground vegetation, tree components, and eventually to streams. Research is showing that there are differences in the characteristics of soils, soil organic matter and microbial communities as a result of the long-term treatments to West Bear that is influencing the movement of the tracer through the ecosystem. Research is showing where the 15-N is within the suite of organic matter molecules that will allow us to better predict the fate of added nitrogen to forest soils, information that is of relevance to various pollution concerns. These findings also include evidence of changing limitations to microbial processes due to carbon, nitrogen, or phosphorus depending on the forest type, soils, and nitrogen status. Most of the 15-N was initially taken up in the forest floor and herbaceous plants, but over time we are measuring its movement through all ecosystems components, a process that now will emerge over decades. Initial evidence is showing that the two watersheds are cycling nitrogen in different ways, and the relative differences vary depending on the ecosystem component being studied. There is a general trend for faster movement of nitrogen in the treated watershed compared to the reference watershed, in some cases opposite of our original hypotheses. The project also included phosphorus fertilization of small plots, which provided evidence for phosphorus limitations on nitrogen cycling.
