Over the four-year grant period, 30 need-based scholarships are provided to qualified science, mathematics, and technology students at Louisiana State University.  The students are participating in a variety of activities, including academic advising and mentoring, Individual Development Plans, academic and professional development activities, academic enhancement program, and research training activities provided by the faculty mentors in the sciences and math disciplines.  The project increases the number of well-prepared undergraduates, including woman and minorities, entering graduate school or industry. The project also promotes inter-cultural participation among non-minority and minority students and faculty members.",
