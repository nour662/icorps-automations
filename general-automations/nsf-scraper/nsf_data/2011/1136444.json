 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans (SACNAS), a non-profit organization, has been instrumental in improving and expanding opportunities for underrepresented groups in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce.   At the core of the SACNAS' mission is the organization's marked focus on encouraging students to pursue advanced degrees in STEM through mentoring, exposure to cutting edge science, and professional development training offered at the SACNAS National Conference.  In addition to attending scientific symposia, receiving information on various graduate and internship programs, student participants have the opportunity to submit abstracts on and present their academic research at poster sessions, which are judged by professional research scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nFunds will be utilized to support the attendance of students and post-doc in NSF-supported disciplines to attend the National conference as a vehicle to increase the diverse participation of students in STEM, particularly in the fields of the biological sciences, geosciences, mathematics, chemistry, physics, computer science,engineering and the social and behavioral sciences.  The activity creates a unique opportunity for the National Science Foundation, in partnership with SACNAS, to meet goals aligned with the America Competes Act, as well as to assist in the development of the intellectual capital of young professionals in the quest to achieve excellence in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded by contributions from the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Directorate for Engineering, Directorate of Mathematics and Physical Sciences, Division of Earth Sciences, the Division of Human Resource Development, and the Office of Integrative Activities.",
