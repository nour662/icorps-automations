This technology encompasses a range of practices from the research and development of non-toxic, eco-friendly materials to the reduction of waste and elimination of pollution through changing patterns of production and consumption.  The major activities of this project include enhancing five core courses through Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry-Learning, creating student research projects, updating the plastics laboratory, and placing students in cooperative education positions. The project team is making efforts to attract women and minorities to the manufacturing program by incorporating GPMT into the program and focusing on its social benefits.  The project team is also making efforts to reach out to secondary school students to stimulate their interests in eco-friendly technology and its environmental impacts.",
