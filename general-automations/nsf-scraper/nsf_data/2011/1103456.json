During her tenure at Darmouth, Dr. Csoba-DeHass would work closely with the Sugpiaq communities in the Lower Kenai Region of Alaska to compile an ethnohistory of the Sugpiaq that would include an analysis of their epistemological views of on their own cultural history.   In addition, Dr. Csoba-DeHass would create K-12 educational materials for use in local schools.  While at Dartmouth University she has been invited to participate as a visiting fellow in the Institute of Arctic Studies, which will give Dr. Csoba-DeHass the opportunity to participate in IAS activities that highlight Arctic scholars and their research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Sugpiaq Ethnohistory project came about as a response to the concerns of many Elders and culture bearers in the Native village of Nanwalek, Alaska. When community members thought about their traditional lifeways, they often expressed that they were \"at the verge of losing everything,\" because there was no information or proper documentation available to use for educational, cultural, and historical projects. Many in Nanwalek wished that local children would learn more about their ancestors\u00c6 history and values, so that they can \"get grounded\" in their Sugpiaq way of life.\n\nBuilding on her previous work with Nanwalek, Medea Csoba DeHass compiled an ethnohistorical account of the Lower Kenai Sugpiaq cultural area and the Alaska Native people inhabiting the region as an NSF postdoctoral fellow based at Dartmouth College. She specifically focused on \"places that count\" such as currently uninhabited village sites, subsistence areas, seasonal camps and culturally significant landscapes. Csoba DeHass designed and completed this research in collaboration with the Nanwalek Indian Reorganization Act Council (IRA) and the people of Nanwalek as active participants.\n\nTo achieve these goals, Csoba DeHass spent six months in Nanwalek working with Elders to collect oral histories and personal historical accounts. These audio-visual materials reflect Sugpiaq epistemological views on the local landscape\u00c6s history and \"what is worth knowing\" about Sugpiaq past on the lower Kenai Peninsula. Additional research activities at archives and museums in Alaska, Berlin, and London revealed relevant documents, artifacts, and information that were new to scholarly discourse and were previously unknown to Native collaborators. \n\nFor instance, the lower Kenai Peninsula items from the Jacobsen collection at the Ethnologisches Museum in Berlin have never been explored before this study. The collection\u00c6s Sugpiaq material is currently accessible to the public through this project\u00c6s research website in an effort to create an opportunity for virtual repatriation and to initiate conversation between museum personnel caring for these items and people in origin communities whose ancestors\u00c6 created them. Likewise, a review of the archival material in the Alaska Commercial Company collection unearthed documents that correlated with oral historical accounts and helped people better understand their past. Therefore, through these project activities, the study\u00c6s intellectual merit was to contribute to the greater scientific understanding of how people continually use adaptive historical reinterpretation to reframe their past from their current point of view, and the ways these cultural specific representations shape people\u00c6s outlook on their futures. \n\nConsequently, the goal of the project was to synthesize these various kinds of sources and information in one comprehensive publication through a collaborative process. The manuscript is under way, and the project website provides a platform for virtual repatriation and community input. It also contributes to the general progress towards innovative venues for synergistic research practice based on successful collaboration between scholars and indigenous Arctic communities. \n\nOn nanwalekhistory.com community members and the public can engage with museum collections located at different parts of the world, read about archival collections, and listen to audio-visual oral history interviews. In addition to learning about these items, people can also actively re-connect with them as part of their heritage. Through this process Sugpiaq people are reintegrating cultural items, which were removed from their communities at one point during the past three hundred years, into their contemporary cultural realities. \n\nWhile the project is completed, it leaves an active legacy behind. Community members continue to reflect on museum pieces, archival information, photographs, and interviews that go beyond the original broader impacts ..."
