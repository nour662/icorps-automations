 "awd_abstract_narration": "We use language not only to communicate about what immediately surrounds us and what actually takes place, but also to entertain possibilities and to describe what may happen or what is likely to occur, to recount what is desirable and what is necessary. Modal expressions such as 'permissible', 'probability', 'may', 'able', and 'likely' allow us to linguistically enter the realm of the non-actual. In the past forty years linguists and philosophers have made great strides in understanding the meaning of modal expressions. One aspect of that meaning that is poorly understood, however, is the gradability of modal meaning: Possibilities can be ranked in terms of their likelihood, their desirability, or their permissibility, and the degrees of likelihood, desirability, or permissibility can often be measured. We can say not only \"It may snow,\" but also \"There is a high probability that it'll snow,\" \"There is a 60% probability that it'll snow,\" or \"It is more likely to snow than to rain.\" \r\n\r\nThis project aims to offer an integrated theory of modality that accounts in a systematic way for the meaning of gradable modal expressions, understanding both the meaning of basic modal expressions as well as how that meaning is modulated by context. The researchers will make use of formal models as well as modern corpus-based methods to investigate the complex interactions between context and content in the interpretation of gradable modal meaning. By firmly grounding our understanding of the language of gradable modality and by integrating this understanding into contemporary work on uncertain inference, this research promises to have important applications to automatic reasoning under partial information and to risk management.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThrough the use of language, humans are able to communicate and reason not merely about what is actually the case, but also about merely possible or hypothetical situations.  This feature of language, known as \"modality\", is seen in the fact that we can talk about whether an event which has not yet occurred is possible, likely, or certain;  modality is also manifest when we plan, talk about right and wrong, or describe an agent's abilities.  It has long been a focus of research in linguistics to develop precise, formal models of modal meanings and theories of the grammatical tools with which we express them.\nThe basis for this project is the observation that modal meanings are gradable.  Gradability is easy to see in the meanings of concrete words like \"tall\" and \"full\".  The gradability of \"tall\"  is observed when when we go beyond saying  whether someone is tall or not, but rather compare one individual's height to another's;  gradability is also present when we measure height, saying that someone is 6' tall.  Many modal words are gradable, as we see with expressions like \"more likely\" or \"quite important\", or \"100% certain\".  Thus, from within the discipline of linguistics, the project requires us to incorporate insights from both theories of modality and theories of gradability.\nThe project had two main aims: (1) to produce a computer-searchable corpus of texts annotated for features of modal meaning, and (2) to develop a precise formal model of gradable modal expressions building on existing theories in linguistics.  The annotated corpus will allow researchers to uncover patterns in the grammar and usage of modal language and we plan use it to develop and test automatic systems for extracting information in texts concerning modal features like the probability of hypothetical events.  The formal model which we have developed expands upon existing theories of gradability in the modal domain, but it does not simply apply previous theories.  We incorporate into the model the kind of contextual, subjective information which would lead someone to judge an event as likely, as opposed to possible, objectively  probable, or absolutely certain.   NSF support was essential in the success of the project.  It allowed us to train students and support a postdoctoral fellow;  both the students and the postdoc made essential contributions to the corpus and the theoretical investigations.  These individuals will be valuable contributors to the next generation of research in semantics and computational linguistics.\nIt is important to understand gradable modality for both a theoretical and practical reasons.  Within linguistics, we aim to understand the cognitive and social factors which allow humans to communicate as they do using language.  Modality is quite obviously a sophisticated feature of language, since it is based on our powerful ability to conceive of and then reason about situations which might or might not occur, and the fact that we can talk about such situations in a graded way (not merely what is likely, but what is more likely) makes this capacity even more powerful.  Moreover, if we are to apply natural language processing technologies to linguistic data with a level of understanding approaching that which humans naturally have, we will need both accurate descriptions of how modal language is used and precise theories of the semantic information encoded by them.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul Portner"
