 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a one year renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the Rice Quantum Institute at William Marsh Rice University.   The award will support students for ten weeks of summer research in topics potentially including chemistry, physics, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, materials science, and bioengineering.   Each student becomes involved in cutting-edge research by joining an individual research group and working with graduate students, postdocs and faculty supervisors.   The students will form a cohesive group through joint housing, weekly interdisciplinary scientific seminars, and weekly social activities. These activities also include laboratory safety training and participation in an online course in ethical and responsible scientific conduct. In mid-session, the students will present brief computer presentations of their work to each other and the PI. In the seventh week, students will construct abstracts for their projects. During the last week students will turn in written reports, design and assemble poster presentations on their research, then present their posters alongside the other undergraduate participants in an extremely well-attended session of the Annual RQI Colloquium.   There will also be a lunch meeting with faculty from various disciplines to discuss strategies for graduate school, the admissions process, and other professional/technical career options.   This award is co-funded by the Division of Physics and the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",
