 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis research is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program of the NSF Division of Materials Research.  This project will investigate the synthesis of new intermetallics, Zintl phases, and complex salts from metal fluxes comprised of two elements.  Synthesis in metal flux allows reactions to take place in a molten solution; this liquid state method enables crystal growth and the formation of unusual new metastable phases.  Combining two different metals to act as a mixed solvent allows for lower reaction temperatures due to eutectic formation, and improved solubility of a wider range of reactants.  Two areas will be explored:  the synthesis of magnetic intermetallic phases in lanthanide/transition metal (Ln/T) eutectic fluxes, and the synthesis of lightweight Zintl phases and complex salt-like compounds in alkaline earth-rich (AE) flux mixtures.  The Ln/T flux syntheses will yield new compounds with complex crystal structures and magnetic properties stemming from magnetic moments of both the lanthanide and the transition metal element.  Possible magnetic behavior that may arise includes magnetic ordering, spin glass behavior, superconductivity, magnetoresistive behavior, mixed valence and heavy fermion behavior.  Reactions in alkaline earth rich fluxes will produce a wide range of classes of materials, depending on the flux metals used.  Fluxes rich in highly electropositive Ca, Sr, or Ba will strongly reduce main group elements to form new Zintl phases and complex salts.  These include new complex hydride phases which may be of interest for hydrogen storage.  Using Mg-rich fluxes will yield more borderline products which do not exhibit complete charge transfer and may as a result show metal-to-insulator transitions. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe Solid State and Materials Chemistry program of the NSF Division of Materials Research supports exploration of unusual synthetic methods which may lead to discovery of new compounds with useful properties.  The metal flux technique uses molten metals as solvents for synthesis and crystal growth of alloys and intermetallics.  Magnetic compounds are being sought by carrying out reactions of a variety of elements in flux mixtures of two magnetic metals (a lanthanide metal and a transition metal).  Light weight alloys for hydrogen storage and potential aerospace applications are being sought from reactions of elements in flux mixtures comprised of lightweight metals such as Li, Mg, and Ca.  Flux growth often yields products in the form of large crystals; this allows for use of a large suite of characterization techniques which will lead to a better understanding of how magnetic and electronic properties are derived from the structure and composition of the compounds.  This research will educate undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers in materials chemistry, which will strengthen the developing program in materials science at Florida State University.  This highly interdisciplinary project involves collaboration with scientists in a variety of areas (such as chemistry, physics, and engineering); this will allow the participants to understand the increasingly complex nature of modern science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project explores the use of metal flux synthesis for the discovery of new inorganic materials.  Flux reactions use an excess of a low-melting reactant that acts as a solvent when heated above its melting point.  Reactions of various elements in low-melting flux metals such as Ga, Sn, or Bi yield complex intermetallic phases; slow cooling of these reactions allows for products to form as large crystals.  Our research has greatly expanded this technique by using mixtures of two metals as the flux, and exploring metals that are not often used as flux components.  Mixed metal solvents allow for lowered reaction temperatures which can promote formation of metastable or kinetically stable products. \n\nIntellectual merit:\n\nOur synthetic efforts have focused on three metal flux systems:  lanthanide/transition metal eutectic mixtures for growth of magnetic intermetallics, calcium/lithium mixtures for discovery of new metal carbide, hydride, and nitride phases, and magnesium/aluminum flux for the synthesis of complex silicides.  In addition to discovery of new materials, we are also looking for reactivity trends and common structural building blocks in products to enable better understanding and prediction of the outcomes of flux reactions.\n\n1.  Lanthanide / transition metal flux reactions  \n\nMagnetic alloys are targeted by carrying out reactions in low melting mixtures of early lanthanides (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) and late transition metals (T = Fe, Co, Ni).  For instance a mixture of 64% Nd and 36% Co has a melting point of 566 &ordm;C.  Main group elements (M) react readily in these Ln/T melts, promoting the formation of Ln/T/M/M\u00c6 intermetallic phases with complex structures containing clusters, chains, layers, and networks of transition metals capped with light elements.  The magnetic properties of the transition metal species in these compounds depend on the extent of T-T bonding.  Figure 1 shows examples of two products; the study of their properties may allow for better understanding and control over magnetic behavior.\n\n2.  Calcium / lithium metal flux reactions  \n\nA 1:1 mole ratio mixture of Ca/Li melts at 300&deg;C. This combination of strongly reducing metals is highly reactive toward main group elements, and has proven to be an excellent solvent for synthesis of complex metal carbides, hydrides, and nitrides.  Traditional synthesis of such compounds often requires high temperatures and pressures; the flux technique is far more convenient.  Some of the flux reaction products are charge-balanced and salt-like semiconductors. These include Ca11Sn3C8, LiCa3As2H, and Ca6Te3N2.  On the other hand, Ca54In13H27 and Ca12InC13-x are not charge-balanced and their structure contains ionic hydride and carbide regions surrounded by metallic Ca/In alloy regions, which may lead to unusual electronic properties.\n\n3.  Magnesium / aluminum flux reactions  \n\nA 1:1 mixture of Mg and Al melts at around 450&deg;C and is highly reactive toward silicon, allowing for discovery and crystal growth of complex metal silicides.  These include magnetic intermetallics such as Ln3FeAl4-xMgxSi2 for Ln = Dy, Yb and Ln5Fe4(MgxAl1-x)5(SixAl1-x)18  for Ln = Gd, Dy, Y.  If lanthanide reactants are replaced by alkaline earth metals (AE = Ca, Sr, Ba), charge-balanced semiconducting or semi-metallic silicides are produced, such as CaMgSi, Ba1.9Ca2.4Mg9.7Si7 and Ba8-xMg15+xSi13. In these compounds, Mg2+ and AE2+ cations balance the charge of the Si4- silicide anions.  Transport measurements on CaMgSi and Ba1.9Ca2.4Mg9.7Si7  indicate that these compounds are promising as thermoelectric materials (data for the latter shown in figure 2).\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThis grant has contributed to the support and scientific training of 7 graduate students, 1 postdoctoral researcher, and 3 undergraduate students. This work has produced 15 publications with several more in preparation; results have also been presented at national and international conferences. \n\nIn the process of car..."
