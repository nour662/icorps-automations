 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Energy storage is the enabling key to the environmentally-friendly transportation and the economic deployment of renewable energy sources. All electrochemical energy storage and conversion materials function as 'living' systems (batteries, pseudocapacitors and fuel cells), within which electrons and ions are moving during charge and discharge. These electronic and ionic motions often trigger defect generation and phase transformations, and consequently result in significant changes in energy density and rate capability of the materials. Establishing the fundamental basis for these dynamical mechanisms during electrochemical processes will accelerate the creation of new synthetic materials with superior energy storage and conversion properties. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This research targets the systematic synthesis, structural characterization and properties evaluation of a series of transition metal oxides xA2MnO3(1-x)Ay(NiMn)O2 (A=Li+, Na+ the mobile species) that are capable of storing energy reversibly. These oxides have intriguing and complex features including nanometer-scale phase separation upon cycling and dynamic cation redistribution at various state of charge, that significantly affect the mobility of the guest species. The reduction-oxidation processes that occur upon releasing the guest species, not only may alter the cation distributions, but also modify the solid-solid interfaces within the material, which are critical to the transport properties as well as the structural stability of the electrodes. The developed framework can be applied as the basis for controlling the dynamic phenomena in solid-state materials for energy storage; such knowledge is critical and transformational to design and develop new materials that will allow higher and faster energy storage and longer lifetime in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems. The broader impacts of this grant are integrated with the research objectives. The PI's education efforts include a). Vertically integrating precollegiate, undergraduate and graduate education and training through tools, practical examples and hands-on laboratory experiences b). Fostering a strong awareness and appreciation for diversity of cultural and educational backgrounds and experience and research approaches among the students to directly impact the diversity on UCSD campus, and c). Engaging in teaching and research in an international science and engineering environment, including organizing an annual international workshop and research-focused exchange program.",

This process converts chemical energy into electrical energy. For the past two decades, lithium has been the dominant chemistry; however, rapid depletion of lithium causes researchers to search for alternative chemistries. Sodium ion batteries are the answer as sodium is low cost, earth abundant, widely distributed, and has similar chemical properties to lithium. Yet sodium ion batteries have not reached their full potential; therefore, it is imperative that high energy and power density materials are developed to further improve the technology. The success of sodium ion batteries can reduce the cost of the grid power storage system, enabling and propelling the use of alternative energy storage systems. With the support of NSF, PI Meng's Laboratory for Energy Storage and Conversion (LESC) at UC San Diego has made several advancements in creating new cathode and anode materials for sodium ion batteries. On the cathode aspect, the combination of experimental in-situ characterization techniques coupled with first principles computation have improved the material design of various layered oxide materials. The research group is able to diagnose the problems of capacity fading and poor kinetics in the previous known compounds and work out solutions that enable new materials with better structure stability and energy storage properties. Meanwhile, breakthroughs have been made on the anode side where proper material was rarely found previously. We are the first group to probe and understand the working mechanism of tin sulfide/reduced-graphene oxide composite material, obtaining one of the highest capacity anode materials with minimal capacity fade in the literature. This allows LESC to be one of the few groups in the world that are able to synthesize both anode and cathode materials to assemble a full sodium ion battery in the lab.

PI Meng has hosted over 30 Latino high school students in 2015 (in Figure 2). For the last three years, we also have had the honor in participating in the ENLACE program at UC San Diego.
