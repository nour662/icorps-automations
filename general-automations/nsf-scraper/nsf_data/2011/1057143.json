 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Sarah E. Reisman of the California Institute of Technology. The goal of Professor Reisman's proposed research is to develop new methods and strategies for the total synthesis of propellane natural products. The first objective of this research is to develop new synthetic methods to prepare chiral amines, such as 4-aminocyclohexadienones. The second objective is to utilize this methodology to prepare by chemical synthesis the propellane natural products periglaucine A, periglaucine B, duaricumine, and acutumine. These molecules have been targeted because they exhibit promising biological properties, including antiviral and anti-amnesic activity, and yet their biological mechanisms of action is not well understood.  This research is expected to deepen our understanding of the chemistry and biology of aza-propellane natural products, and to provide new opportunities for fundamental research toward the development of new chemical reactions. \r\n\r\nProfessor Reisman will also initiate a new program that seeks to provide mentors to young women in the Pasadena Unified School District (PUSD) interested in pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Studies have shown that good mentoring is critical to the persistence and success of women in STEM fields. Female high school students in the PUSD will be recommended to the program by teachers involved in the Caltech Classroom Connections program. Each student will be \"matched\" with a female graduate student mentor from Caltech. Because 84% of students in the PUSD are of Hispanic, African American and other minority populations, this program also provides mentors to students in these underrepresented groups. By engaging female high school students directly with mentors from Caltech, this outreach program strives to increase diversity in STEM disciplines by providing mentors and role models for a future generation of women and minority scientists and engineers.",

Their complex molecular structures provide a fertile setting for discovery of new chemical reactions. Endeavors in natural product synthesis drive advances in the state-of-the-art in organic chemistry, and in so doing, impact a variety of research areas that integrate synthetic tools, from catalysis and materials science to biology and medicine. Support from this NSF Career award has allowed us to complete chemical syntheses of the following biologically active natural products: (&ndash;)-trichorabdal A, (&shy;&ndash;)-longikaurin E, (+)-psiguadial B, (&ndash;)-8-demethoxyrunanine and cepharatines A, C, and D, and (+)-salvileucalin B. These efforts involved conceptualizing a synthetic strategy&mdash;or molecular blueprint&mdash;and then validating this blueprint experimentally in the laboratory. Now that we know how to prepare these molecules synthetically, we also have the ability to make precise molecular edits to their structure, which can enable their further development as probes to study biological pathways, or potentially as medicines. In addition to developing syntheses for several natural products, we also discovered new chemical reactions that allow us to increase the efficiency with which we make molecules with complex structures. These new chemical reactions expand the synthetic toolbox, and include: 1) Rh- and Cu-catalyzed arene cyclopropantion reactions of a-diazo-b-ketonitriles; 2) Pd-catalyzed Fukuyama cross-coupling reactions of secondary organozinc reagents; 3) Diasteroselective 1,2-addition reactions to quinone-derived tert-butanesulfinamides; 4) Tandem Wolff rearrangement/asymmetric ketene addition reactions. To achieve our scientific objectives, nine chemistry PhD students and one postdoctoral fellow obtained training in the theory and practice of synthetic organic chemistry. In addition, we have been actively engaged in scientific outreach aimed at improving the diversity of the scientific workplace. These outreach activities have targeted female and under-represented minority (URM) high school students in the Pasadena Unified School District, with the objective of increasing their participation in STEM related careers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sarah&nbsp;E&nbsp;Reisman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1057143/1057143_10118071_1477855104550_NSF_Outcomes_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1057143/1057143_10118071_1477855104550_NSF_Outcomes_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Natural Products\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1057143/1057143_10118071_1477855104550_NSF_Outcomes_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Natural Products\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The molecular structures of natural products that were synthesized in the laboratory as a result of this award.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sarah Reisman</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sarah&nbsp;E&nbsp;Reisman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Natural Products</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
