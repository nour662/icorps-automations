 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award is to develop a versatile, multifunctional coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) imaging system that will be capable of nondestructive and noninvasive measurement for nanoscience, biology, and medical research with 3D confocality and nanoscale resolutions. The project will integrate morphology characterization, microscale CARS-based multimodal nonlinear optical imaging and tip-enhanced CARS imaging capabilities in a single system. Deliverables include a multi-functional CARS system, documentation of research results, and engineering student education.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this project will create a key equipment in a core facility that serves as a cross-disciplinary and multi-organization research and education platform in the region. The instrument will support education for graduate and undergraduate students for a diverse group of people, including women and underrepresented minority students. The successful development of this instrument will open many research opportunities in nanoscience/technology, material science, cellular biology and other fields in the United States. Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit through involvement in the research and classroom instruction. The engagement of K-12 students and teachers in this project will also establish new partnerships between the University and K-12 schools.",
