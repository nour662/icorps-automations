Various\r\ncorrespondences or dualities arising from physics have had a\r\ngreat impact on mathematics. One of these correspondences is the\r\nLandau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence. This proposal offers a\r\ncomprehensive program to establish this correspondence in\r\nmathematics with mathematical rigor.  There is a wide range of\r\napplications such as global mirror symmetry, the computation of\r\nGromov-Witten invariants of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, and to\r\nmodular forms.\r\n\r\nSince the era of Newton, mathematics has been a key tool in\r\nhelping us to comprehend the universe.  An example is\r\ndifferential geometry via Einstein's theory of general\r\nrelativity. During the last twenty years there has been a great\r\ndeal of activity in building so-called string-theoretic models of\r\nthe universe. The string-theoretic model of the universe is\r\nten-dimensional, our usual 4-dimensional space-time togeher with\r\na very small 6-dimensional space called a Calabi-Yau manifold.\r\nSuch a small internal space will affect our space-time through\r\ncertain mathematical quantities such as Gromov-Witten\r\ninvariants. The computation of these invariants has been a\r\ncentral problem in geometry and physics.  This is the area in\r\nwhich mathematical tools can be very useful.  The current\r\nproposal envisages a theoretical framework as well as developing\r\ntechnical tools to compute Gromov-Witten invariants",
