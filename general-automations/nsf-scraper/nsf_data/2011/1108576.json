In Japan, people tend to see themselves as interdependent and connected to others; a person cannot be understood without understanding his or her relationship with others. In the United States, people tend to see themselves very differently. There the emphasis is on being an individual, separate from others. A person is understood through his or her internal traits, attributes, and goals. We expect to find then that academic failure in Japan and the United States will be experienced very differently. In Japan, we expect that students will be more likely to consider how a failure may affect those people with whom they are interconnected (e.g., family, classmates), while in the United States we expect that students will be more likely to consider what the failure means about their personal selves. In the survey for Japan, we present undergraduate participants with a vignette prompt in which we describe a student who is experiencing a difficulty and ask participants to imagine that they are in the student&rsquo;s position. Participants then answer a series of questions aimed at measuring the extent to which they are considering others after the difficult academic experience or themselves. We also plan to run a version of this study in the United States. We expect to find that Japanese students will be more likely to consider others after the academic failure compared to the European American students.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/04/2012<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alyssa&nbsp;Fu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
