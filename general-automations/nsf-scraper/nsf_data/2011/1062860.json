The specific program objectives are to : 1) ensure diversity of participants - at least 60% of REU participants will be from the underrepresented groups (females and ethnic minorities); 2) design and implement a 10-week research program that clearly articulates REU participants? research activities and facilitates their interactions with interdisciplinary research groups; 3) facilitate opportunities for professional development and interdisciplinary cohort experience through weekly seminars, field trips and discussion forums; 4) collaborate with external experts on assessment and engineering education research to evaluate effectiveness of the program; 5) disseminate research and program assessment results through an end of program research proceedings and at various conferences and journal publications; and 6) facilitate opportunities for social interactions that will enhance personal and professional bonding among REU participants. A group of experienced faculty will direct REU participants' research and two external experts will assist in assessment and recruitment activities. \r\n\r\nThe site will expand the pool of future researchers in water sciences who will help in addressing one of Grand Challenges of the National Academy of Engineering. A well-conceived plan to disseminate research and assessment results widely is proposed. This REU program will provide significant opportunities for underrepresented groups to be engaged in water sciences research.\r\n\r\nThis site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
