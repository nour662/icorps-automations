 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the role of fund flows and fees in portfolio\r\nchoice and asset pricing. The main focus is on (i) understanding how\r\nthese aspects fit in the existing theory, (ii) developing theoretical\r\ntools that make them tractable, and (iii) evaluating the departures from\r\nclassical results due to flows and fees. Central issues are the\r\nextension of duality theory, and the development of asymptotic\r\ntechniques in the long-horizon and small-fees limits.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to incorporate fund flows and fees - two central\r\naspects of financial intermediation - in mathematical models of\r\nfinancial markets, to understand their agency effects on asset\r\nallocation, and their implications for welfare and pricing. This project\r\nwill help understand the role of financial intermediaries, the\r\nincentives created by their fee-based contracts, and their interaction\r\nwith investors' response through flows, that is subscriptions and\r\nredemptions.",
