 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided to the PI who will use observations and analyses of coastal stratigraphy and geomorphology, paleobathymetric models, geochemical proxies, and a physical oceanographic model to understand Holocene responses of a coastal system in North Carolina to changes in climate, geomorphology, and hydrodynamics. The modern estuarine system has a microtidal range of approximately 0.1 m, due in part to the existence of the Outer Banks barrier islands. They hypothesize that barrier island segmentation during two intervals of Holocene time resulted in an astronomical tidal component substantially in excess of the modern system. To understand the response of the system to geomorphic changes brought on by climate and sea-level conditions, they propose to develop paleoenvironmental and paleobathymetric models of this system at specific time slices, and model the tidal effects (amplitude, currents, sediment transport, salinity). Geochemical proxies will be used to understand the regional climate changes before, during, and following these two events. These data will facilitate a better understanding of the past coastal system response to climate conditions, and the potential for future changes. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This investigation will support two masters students and one undergraduate student at ECU. Sea-level rise and its effects are of high societal relevance all along the US East Coast.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overarching outcome of this project is an improved understanding of the relationship between barrier island morphology and estuarine processes, as they respond to sea-level rise and storm patterns.  These results will advance the ability to forecast coastal changes in response to future scenarios of sea-level rise and hurricane impacts. \n\nFundamental findings include the recognition that the Outer Banks barrier islands of North Carolina exhibit extreme dynamic behavior, ranging from highly fragmented to nearly continuous, on time scales of centuries to millennia.  Barrier island fragmentation occurred at 4000-3500 calendar years before present (cal yr BP) and at 1200-500 cal yr BP.  The first event occurred in response to the interaction of sea-level rise with the antecedent topography (i.e., the flooded landscape).  Overtopping of interstream divides produced a much larger basin, increasing fetch and tidal prism, leading to barrier fragmentation.  The second event occurred in response to climate conditions that control storm patterns (i.e., hurricane paths, frequency and intensity).  An increase in hurricane impacts on this section of the Atlantic coast during the Medieval Climate Anomaly increased inlet number and size, creating a positive feedback that (based on hydrodynamic modeling) amplified the tides, currents, and wave energy within the back-barrier estuary.  This amplification of energy is proposed to have maintained a more fragmented barrier chain until the frequency of storm impacts was reduced, or until extensive flood-tide delta formation (the Hatteras Flats, behind the barrier islands) acted to reduce flow through the inlets via friction and reduced basin volume.  Hydrodynamic modeling using the reconstructed morphology corresponding to the fragmentation episodes suggests that tidal range within the Pamlico Sound may have been 30 to 40 cm, in comparison to the modern range of ca 10 cm.  Additionally, tidal current velocities, suspended sediment load, and salinity increased within portions of the estuary.  These findings are consistent with sedimentological results, and paleo-salinity changes based on foraminiferal analyses.  The largest modeled impacts likely occurred in northern Pamlico Sound, and toward the head of the drowned river valley estuaries.  Modeling also suggests that deepening of the Sound had the effect of increasing the magnitude of storm surge within the basin.  These reconstructions of the geomorphology, paleoenvironments, and hydrodynamics of the NC coastal region provide insight into expected future changes in response to accelerated sea-level rise and/or an increase in hurricane frequency or intensity.  Information has been shared with the NC Division of Coastal Management to improve policy decision-making.  \n\nA further important outcome of this project has been the impact on student learning.  Several undergraduate and graduate courses included field trips and data gathering which were used in the research.  Approximately forty undergraduate students were exposed to this project and contributed to sedimentological analyses of core material for their Sedimentology class.  Graduate students in Marine Geology (GEOL5350) participated in microfossil analyses of core material.  Data were used in the teaching of graduate level courses including The Geology of Coastal Processes, Marine Geology, and Stratigraphic Analysis.  Seven graduate students used project resources to complete their thesis research projects.       \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David J Mallinson"
