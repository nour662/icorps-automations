 "awd_abstract_narration": "Even the cold of outer space is hot in comparison to ultracold atoms and molecules. By using a combination of red-detuned, circularly polarized laser light and magnetic fields - the magneto-optical trap (MOT) - room-temperature atoms can be cooled to just above absolute zero (~100 microK) and trapped in a volume a few millimeter in diameter. These ultracold gases allow precision studies of atomic energy levels, leading to deeper insight into quantum mechanics, the theory that describes the world of the very small. \r\n\r\nIn Dr. Kleinert's lab at Willamette University, ultracold gases of rubidium and calcium are trapped together and combined to form molecular dimers, RbCa, a molecule that has never before been formed or studied. These novel molecules are attractive systems to study due to their non-vanishing electric and magnetic dipole moments. By carefully tailoring the internal quantum state of the molecules and utilizing the permanent dipole moments through interactions with external electric and magnetic fields, these molecules find applications in quantum information processing, studies of fundamental symmetries and high-precision spectroscopy. \r\n\r\nThe project is used to train undergraduates considering careers in research, to enrich the research environment of the physics department and Willamette University as a whole, and to further enhance integration of teaching and research on campus. Specifically, Kleinert is including undergraduate researchers in all aspects of her project, from initial experimental assembly, testing, data collection, and analysis to dissemination through publications and conference presentations. This exposure to all aspects of a state-of-the art research project together with close faculty mentoring and peer-teaching prepares students well and inspires them to continue higher education. \r\n\r\nIn addition to work on campus, Kleinert also actively participates in outreach programs to foster scientific curiosity in young children and interested adults alike. The NSF award allows her to include students from under-represented groups in her research project through collaboration with the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, and to invite experts to campus to give research talks and to act as mentors and role models.",

RbCa does not exist in nature, and is only stable at very low temperatures (about a thousand times colder than outer space). To form these cold molecules, we individually cool rubidium and calcium atoms using a workhorse in atomic physics, the magneto-optical trap, or MOT. In a MOT, atoms are bathed from all directions in near-resonant laser light, which slows them from thousands of meters per second at room temperature to just a few inches per second. The addition of a magnetic field pushes these cold atoms toward the center of an ultra-high vacuum chamber where they can be observed. On average, about a million atoms at temperatures of close to absolute zero are trapped that way. Ultracold rubidium and calcium atoms can then be forced to form the heteronuclear dimer RbCa by providing them with a photon, a light particle, of just the right color.

Most cold quantum objects to date have only one or the other. It is possible to design experiments in which one uses one of the dipole moments to pin down the molecules in space, and the other to do physics with them. For example, having a magnetic dipole moment means that these molecules are small bar magnets, and just as bar magnets can be positioned on a table with their north poles pointing either up or down, these molecules can be aligned with their dipole moments pointing either up or down. A sequence of aligned molecules can then be used to encode information if one assigns 'up' the bit '1' and 'down' the bit '0'.
