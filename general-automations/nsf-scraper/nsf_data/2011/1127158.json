 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed AIR project will commercialize a new technological breakthrough, the Interactive Web-Enabled Research System (IWERS-TDP), for the delivery and evaluation of a new online prevention application, TeenDrivingPlan, and will determine and implement adaptations of IWERS-TDP for its use as a general-purpose platform (IWERS-GENERAL) for large scale evaluation of diverse applications. The IWERS concept applies methodologies that bring rigor and required privacy and security of FDA-monitored clinical research trials to the evaluation of online applications. Year 1 will involve developing the Ecosystem, commercializing TeenDrivingPlan and the IWERS-TDP evaluation system, and designing market-driven modifications of IWERS-TDP. Year 2 will focus on growing the Ecosystem and implementing required software adaptations to evolve IWERS-TDP into the IWERS-GENERAL platform, in partnership with industry collaborators and new investors. \r\n\r\nThe proposed Ecosystem will support two national goals: (1) to strengthen the US innovation ecosystem (for technology to promote health and wellness) and (2) to create a society in which all people live long, healthy lives. Through accelerated commercialization of evaluated, commercially viable online applications in injury prevention, health promotion and disease management that are broadly available through the Web, the Ecosystem will reduce disparities in access to high quality health resources. Experiential training in entrepreneurship will prepare diverse students for careers in e-Health through work on IWERS development, research and commercialization. Jobs will be created as the Ecosystem is established and evolves into a regional hub-and-spoke technology cluster in Health and Wellness in the Greater Philadelphia Region. The woman-led Ecosystem will promote diverse faculty participation.",
