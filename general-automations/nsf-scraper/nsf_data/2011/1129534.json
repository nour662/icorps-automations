 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this SFS Capacity Building project, the Center for Information and Systems Assurance (CISA) at Kansas State University, which is a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Research (CAE-R), is collaborating with the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College (CGSC) and Manhattan Area Technical College (MATC) to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity/information assurance curriculum appropriate for the different student bodies at the three institutions. Kansas State University is a public land-grant university with a high level of research activity. CGSC's mission is to educate military officers to support the Army's operational requirements. MATC is a two-year public institution of higher education.\r\n\r\nFour courses constitute the overall curriculum being developed: Introduction to Information Assurance and Cybersecurity, Emerging Threats in Cyberspace, Advanced Cyber-Offense and -Defense Technologies, and Cyber-Warfare.\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes of the project are:\r\n\r\n* a comprehensive cybersecurity curriculum that addresses the challenge of educating and providing hands-on training to students of broad academic backgrounds;\r\n\r\n* courses with innovative modules and lesson plans based on lab exercises, warfare, and cyber-threat scenarios that can seamlessly integrate security education content throughout different parts of existing information technology curricula;\r\n\r\n* detailed instructional manuals to accompany each course module; and\r\n\r\n* enhancement of faculty expertise in cybersecurity at the partnering institutions.\r\n\r\nCourse materials are being created, piloted, and evaluated at the three institutions, and are being made available to a wider audience via the Web. The investigators are also using connections with other regional colleges and leveraging other initiatives at Kansas State -- e.g., Research Experiences for Teachers (RET), GK-12 STEM Fellows, Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), and Girls Researching Our World (GROW) -- to extend the reach of the curriculum.",
