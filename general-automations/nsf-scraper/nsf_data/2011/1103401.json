 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project tests the ability to reconstruct climate during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3) using sediments, pollen, and radioisotopic analysis of tree macrofossils recovered from a debris flow site in Oregon.  Additionally, the researchers aim to explore the potential to use such logs that have measurable Carbon-14 to establish a floating chronological sequence to around 50,000 years.\r\n\r\nThe primary broader impacts involve extending radiocarbon dating back more than 12,000 years in fossil logs containing tree rings for climatic analyses. The research would be done in close collaboration with the Oregon Department of Transportation and its contractors, resulting in a strong interaction between the scientists and technical and engineering experts, although it was not clear how this would advance science and engineering in the next generation.  Science results would become part of an outreach effort at the university and an Oregon state exposition. Graduate students from two universities (University of Arizona and California State University at Fresno) would be part of the research.",

Realignment of U.S. highway 20 between Corvallis OR across the Oregon Coast Range onto Newport OR uncovered significant organic deposits at depth that include the boles of large trees. Radiocarbon dates on subsurface organic material from the project area range from 17,850 &plusmn; 100 to infinite ages &gt;50 thousand years old (radiocarbon dates B.P.). Five large trees were recovered from one of an eventual seven road-cuts with the largest individual bole &gt;1.2 meters (48 inches) in diameter.  The sedimentary deposits are interpreted as paleo-translational landslides involving the movement along slip planes of sediments of the  Tyee Formation.  Preservation of the wood material and associated macrofossils is excellent, indicating that the deposits were sealed from any oxygen during their deposition.\n\nThe first recovered bole (identified as Western Red Cedar; Thuja plicata) shows excellent preservation of late-wood rings with the early wood showing a high percentage of ghost tracheids.  Ring counts from a portion of this bole, a four inch block of outer rings, contained between 120 to 130 rings of annual growth with good sensitivity for climate reconstruction.  Eleven additional trees were discovered in a deposit together partially upright and they have all been identified as Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).  These trees are more whole and larger in diameter than the recovered Western Red Cedar tree.  A total of 11 trees were eventually recovered from this deposit and have all been identified as Douglas-fir. \n\nThe tree rings were measured and correlated between the different boles.  There were a total of more than 300 individual rings that cross correlated.  The wood was in very good conditions and in most cases included pith and sapwood.
