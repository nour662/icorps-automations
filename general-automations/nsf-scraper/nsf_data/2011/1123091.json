 "awd_abstract_narration": "Archaeological survey and excavation at the ancient Swahili stonetown of Songo Mnara will enable the exploration of aspects of ancient urban planning in coastal East Africa. Dr Jeffrey Fleisher (Rice University) and Dr Stephanie Wynne-Jones (University of York) will lead an international team of specialists from the U.S., U.K., and Tanzania in the investigation of economic and ritual activities at Songo Mnara and of how they related to planned and unplanned parts of the town. Support from the National Science Foundation in collaboration with the Arts and Humanities Research Council in the United Kingdom, allows for three seasons of fieldwork at this site on the southern Tanzanian coast. Swahili stonetowns, found along the eastern African coast, were the home to an indigenous and cosmopolitan form of urbanism that linked Africa with the Indian Ocean world system from AD 700 to 1500. A World Heritage Site, Songo Mnara is recognized as the most impressive of all Swahili townscapes, including more than 40 coral-built houses and room-blocks, 5 mosques and multiple cemeteries.  Occupation of the site was brief, from the 14th to 16th centuries AD, coinciding with the golden age of Swahili towns along the coast, and particularly at its neighboring site of Kilwa Kisiwani.\r\nThis work will contribute substantially to discussions of organizational principles in ancient town plans more generally, and to research on aspects of town layouts that were formed by movement, activity and use, rather than formal planning from above.  By exploring the way the actions of people both shaped and were shaped by town plans, this study will provide a holistic case study that addresses current concerns with the plans and spatial practices of ancient complex societies.  \r\nThe fieldwork will explore the urban space of Songo Mnara at four interlinked scales: (1) household activities through excavations within and around buildings; (2) public and communal practices in the open areas and monuments of the site; (3) the site plan will be accurately plotted; and (4) the site will be positioned within its broader island landscape. \r\nThe exceptional preservation at Songo Mnara allows the construction of a robust dataset to explore how Swahili towns were both planned and unplanned.  This will offer insight into the multiple ways that towns plans emerged - through the efforts of powerful people, but also through the more basic and daily acts of those living in and moving through the town.  \r\nBroader impacts of the project include important training for American, British, and Tanzanian students, both graduate and undergraduate.  Additionally, the project contributes to the preservation and conservation of Songo Mnara, which remains an \"endangered\" World Heritage Site.  A long term commitment to archaeological research at the site will provide important opportunities for community involvement, and educational opportunities to demonstrate the unique role that archaeology can play in its preservation and documentation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF/AHRC funded project \"Swahili Town Planning: The Songo Mnara Urban Landscape\" was completed in 2017 by co-PIs Jeffrey Fleisher (Rice University) and Stephanie Wynne-Jones (University of York).  A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Songo Mnara is recognized as the most impressive of all ancient Swahili townscapes, including more than 40 coral-built houses and room-blocks, six mosques and multiple cemeteries, dating to the 14th-16th centuries AD.  As such, it provided a perfect site to examine archaeologically the social, economic, political and religious forces that created its town plan.  With an international team of specialists from the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, South Africa, and Tanzania, the project completed three seasons of fieldwork in 2011, 2013 and 2016. \n\nOur explicit goal was to investigate how economic and ritual activities related to planned and unplanned parts of Songo Mnara, and how this contributed to the way its town plan emerged.  The findings from this research have provided ample evidence for the way both top-down and  bottom up activities served to shape and structure urban space.  Although the efforts of powerful people and families structured important buildings and spaces at Songo Mnara (such as elite houses and the vistas they afforded) we recovered ample evidence of the ways that non-elite residents also shaped the town plan, through the construction of earthen houses, public spaces, and the daily activities that they carried out in the town.  This research therefore offers an important example of the way that ancient urban places were formed by movement, activity and use, rather than simply through formal planning from town leaders.  This study also demonstrates the way that the actions of people both shaped and were shaped by town plans, providing a holistic case study that contributes to current concerns with the plans and spatial practices of ancient complex societies.  These results will have an impact within archaeology, urging archaeologists to move beyond examinations of prominent monuments and houses, to more prosaic parts of urban areas, including the houses of non-elites as well as public and ancillary spaces.  As part of this research, we developed new techniques to investigate public spaces and houses, using the analysis of soil chemistry in conjunction with other lines of evidence (artifacts, survey data, and geophysical surveys).  By demonstrating the utility of these techniques, this project paves the way for future comparative studies in other ancient urban settings.\n\nThis project also served as a venue for training for graduate and undergraduate students.  Three PhD dissertations were based on data from this research, and other graduate students were able to broaden their field experience in the service of their own research careers.  For undergraduate students, this project provided a first experience of fieldwork, and an entry to the field of archaeology.  A number of these students moved on to graduate work in archaeology and other related fields.  Of particular note is the training of many undergraduate women on this project (18 of 23 undergraduates who participated in the project were women), helping to broaden their representation in the discipline.\n\nFinally, this project contributed to the conservation and preservation of Songo Mnara itself.  Songo Mnara is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and when we began the project, the site had been put on the Endangered List due to conservation issues.  Our project worked closely with conservators to help guide conservation efforts and to preserve archaeological deposits for the future.  In 2014, the site was removed from the Endangered List.  This ensures that this remarkable site will be available for future visitors and tourists; our extensive research at the site has transformed the way the story of this site, and its role in the broader Swahili and Indian Ocean world, is told.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey B Fleisher"
