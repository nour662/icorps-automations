 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to continue a very successful program of monitoring the 15 GHz flux densities of blazars and radio galaxies on the 40m radio telescope at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. Blazars are highly luminous and highly active sources of radio, optical, x-ray, and &#947;-ray radiation powered by massive black holes in galactic nuclei. By comparing the radio light curves with simultaneous &#947;-ray light curves from NASA's Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope the project will help to elucidate the emission mechanisms, energy sources, and jet collimation processes in these objects. In particular, measurement of time-delays between radio and &#947;-ray flares can tie down the location of the radiation sources and determine whether they are associated with the jets or accretion disks around the black holes.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students.  The awardees will continue their educational outreach program in collaboration with colleagues at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and with the Goldstone Apple Valley Radio Telescope and the Lewis Center for Educational Research to bring teachers from US and international schools to California to learn astronomy and modern scientific methods via hands-on experience with radio telescopes. The teachers will take their knowledge and tools back to their schools and apply them in high-school teaching programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nQuasars were discovered in 1964.  They are extremely powerful very compact sources of radiation in the nuclei of some galaxies, which outshine the combined radiation from all the stars in the galaxy.  We now know that quasars are powered by spinning black holes with masses that can be as high as ten billion times the mass of the sun.  Some quasars have jets along their spin axes along which material is ejected at speeds very close to the speed of light.  The Fermi-GST provided for the first time an opportunity to study a large number of \"blazars\" &ndash; quasars in which the jet axis is aligned close to the line of sight &ndash; in gamma-rays.  Two theories had been suggested for the origin of the gamma-ray emission in blazars &ndash; in one the gamma-rays originate close to the black hole, whereas in the other the gamma-rays originate far out along the jet.  We monitored a large number (~1830) of blazars at radio wavelengths with the 40 m Telescope of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory and compared the radio emission with the gamma-ray emission seen with Fermi-GST. We observed these sources twice a week for  years. In about one hundred blazars the gamma-ray emission is bright enough to measure it with high accuracy in less than a week at gamma-ray energies.  The variations in radio and gamma-ray emission in these objects were compared and it was found that the radio and gamma-ray emission is definitely correlated and that in about 10% of the objects it is clear that the gamma-ray emission precedes the radio emission by 1 year -10 years (in the rest frame of the object), depending on the object.  This provides strong support for the theory in which the gamma-ray emission originates closer to the black hole than the radio emission.  In addition the ~1830 blazar light curves provide an unprecedented data set for testing theories and simulations of relativistic jets.  These data are all available on a public website http://www.astro.caltech.edu/ovroblazars/ with name \"guest\" and no password so that they can be easily accessed and use by the astronomical community. This work produced three PhDs and supported four post-doctoral fellows and three undergraduates. The broader impacts of this work can be seen in the fact that astronomy captures the lay public\u00c6s imagination and reminds us that the world is a very small place in a vast universe.  It continually re-awakens one\u00c6s sense of wonder at nature - bringing humility and caution in its wake.  In this era of climate change this is very important and astronomy provides a direct channel of communication with people of all ages and all nations, illustrating the enormous importance of a technically literate society.  The production of relativistic jets by supermassive black holes in the heart of active galaxies is an extraordinary phenomenon that immediately grabs peoples\u00c6 attention.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anthony C.
