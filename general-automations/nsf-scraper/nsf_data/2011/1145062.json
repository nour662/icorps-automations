 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award provides funding to develop an innovative 3-D additive manufacturing process capable of producing uniform metal and polymer features with nanometer resolution for applications in optics, photonics, biomaterials and other areas. Here, we propose to combine the patterning resolution and scaling benefits provided by the recently developed optical trap assisted nanopatterning method with the 3-D additive capabilities of ultrafast multiphoton polymerization processing. However in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to attain a deeper understanding of these processes and demonstrate the feasibility of such a combined approach. To this end, this proposal will focus on experimentally and numerically probing fundamental proof?]of?]principle questions related to the compatibility of ultrafast laser processing and polymer precursor solutions with optically trapped microspheres, and the ability to polymerize precursor solutions in the vicinity of microspheres without contamination or redeposition. Numerical studies will include finite difference time domain simulations for optical propagation through the liquid solution and polystyrene microspheres. Whereas, experiments will use both in situ imaging during laser processing and ex situ characterization to identify the material response.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will have a profound impact on a number of diverse application areas where multiscale and multifunctional 3-D architectures are needed to advance functionality, such as in photonic materials, optoelectronics, microfluidics, tissue engineering, etc. Broad dissemination in these areas through publications and international presentations will ensure researchers gain widespread benefit from our studies. But perhaps more importantly, the success of this research will provide a demonstration of feasibility that is necessary to secure funding through traditional vehicles in order to further develop this potentially transformative materials processing approach. Finally, we envision this research as a seed for an international collaboration between researchers at Princeton and University of Erlangen-Nurenberg, School of Advanced Optical Technologies (UEN-SAOT) in Germany for 3-D laser based manufacturing. To this end, funds have been allocated to support the travel to UEN-SAOT where the PIs will help train other researchers and students in this developing technology.",

However this method, which uses optically trapped and manipulated polystyrene beads as near field focusing objectives, was originally developed for us in 2D systems and our goal is to assess the opportunities and limitations in scaling this basic technology to 3D.  To this end, our project was quite successful as it provided a number of important proofs of principle.  These include demonstrating that the OTAN process can be used to create uniform nanoscale structures on non-planar surfaces, bead manipulation and positioning can be done in polymer precursor solutions, and parallel patterning on multi-level surfaces is possible.  These results have been published in leading scientific journals and disseminated to the greater research community.  But more importantly, these initial results establish potential for OTAN as a unique and viable 3D additive processing method.\n\n \n\nThe broader impact of this work is that it has not only laid the groundwork for further scientific and technological development in the nanotechnology arena, but it has initiated a number of student and outreach opportunities that have continued beyond the end of this project.
