 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to fundamentally advance the development of affordable, high-power phased-array antenna technology. The approach is to use the recent advances in the areas of microwave metamaterials and microfluidics to develop a new class of high-power-capable, tunable, true-time-delay microwave lenses.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The fundamental tradeoffs that exist between cost, power handling capability, thermal management, and efficiency have hindered the development of high-power, affordable phased-array antenna technology. This project seeks to address these fundamental shortcomings using a previously unexplored interdisciplinary approach. A new class of metamaterials will be used to develop true-time-delay microwave lenses capable of handling very high power levels. A microfluidic mechanism will be used to rapidly reconfigure the lens response and achieve dynamic beam steering in lens-based phased arrays.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project is expected to positively impact the society and the economy by proliferating the use of phased-array technology in future wireless systems that aim at addressing grand societal and economic challenges, including efficient access to the radio spectrum and economically viable solar power transmission. Educational goals of this work are intimately linked to the research objectives and include involvement of underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in research activities, integration of research into the teaching of engineering at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and development and broad dissemination of research-based educational materials. The research findings of this work will be integrated with existing University of Wisconsin-Madison courses to enhance the undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula.",
