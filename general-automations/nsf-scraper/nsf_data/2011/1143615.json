 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the Doctoral Consortium held in conjunction with the IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics to be held on October 11-13, 2011. Attendees of the Doctoral Consortium include graduate students nearing completion of their dissertations who have been accepted to the consortium. Each recent Ph.D. graduate or soon to be graduate chosen to participate in the consortium is paired with a senior researcher who will serve as their mentor during the conference. The goal of this consortium is to provide talented young researchers the opportunity to discuss their work formally and informally with both their peers and senior researchers. These interactions with others coming from different research labs with different viewpoints typically strengthen young researchers ability to communicate the value of their own work and to set their work more clearly in the broader context of the research field as a whole.",
