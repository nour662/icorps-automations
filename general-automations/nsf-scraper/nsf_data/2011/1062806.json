 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year REU Site program at Stony Brook University will engage eight undergraduate students in multidisciplinary nanotechnology research experiences involving four departments in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (Materials Science and Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering,) and will be administered by the University's Center for Inclusive Education (CIE). Providing real research experiences for undergraduates is a critical need for the successful education of the next generation of engineers and scientists. The research experiences and laboratories involved will provide research experiences for REU interns in all aspects of nanotechnology and nanomaterials development, including polymeric nanostructures for medical applications, computational nanostructure design, creation of catalytic surfaces for energy and environmental remediation, and development of nanostructured sensors. This collaboration will encourage the participation of students from underrepresented groups in research and graduate education opportunities and will also leverage the resources and networks of multiple departments effectively. The REU Site program includes both an Ethics Component and a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)component.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator will actively recruit students from a diversity of academic backgrounds with a significant number coming from institutions other than Stony Brook; promote recruitment at small regional colleges with limited research opportunities; and continue to take advantage of the contacts at historically black colleges and from universities in Puerto Rico to recruit students from underrepresented groups. This program provides a truly multidisciplinary experience which fully integrates research and education, an approach shown to enhance learning and motivation, as well as enhance recruitment and retention of students from a diverse background. Weekly journal clubs, research methods instruction, academic counseling and community building events promise to integrate these students into the scientific community with meaningful exposure also to the university/departmental culture of support that exists. Research results will be disseminated to the campus and local community, and to other scientists in the U.S. and worldwide.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in Nanotechnology for Health, Energy and the Environment (NSF-EEC 1062806), through its first three years, has directly supported the research of 24 students, and an additional 10 through matching support obtained by the P.I.  This project stems from the need to implement an effective model for research-oriented undergraduate education which meets the needs of both students and their eventual employers in the emerging nanotechnology sector.  In a broader sense, it responds to the need to recruit students from diverse populations for enhancing diversity in STEM fields, and the need to enhance engineering education with a focus on emerging technology systems in the context of applications and societal impact.  We accomplish this through an approach which supports self-efficacy, multidisciplinary team-building, understanding broader impacts of technology, and building the skills necessary for research and life-long learning  through a program of  faculty-mentored multidisciplinary research, professional development, and exposure to real-world issues which reflect the impact of nanotechnology on society, the business community, human health and the environment.\n\nIntellectual Merit: Through this program, REU fellows have become an integral part of mentor\u00c6s research teams,  helping the students to develop their careers using their skills in  science and engineering.  In addition, oir assessment of participants have shown thaty fellows gain belief in their ability to fully participate in the research enterprise, contribute to the community of scholars, and excel in nanotechnology and related fields.In addition, REU fellows reported that they learned about ethical issues in carrying out and reporting research and gained practical insights that inform their thinking and planning about further education, graduate school, and careers.\n\nBroader Impact:  The program achieved its goals in recruiting participants from groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines (see figure), including more than 35% from underrepresented minorities and over 30% female students. The REU program also has provided supplemental support for five secondary school teachers to participate in the summer research activities, using these experiences to enhance high school curricula and build research programs for their students.  These teachers have developed research courses in thier school districts, incorporated nanotechnology and nanoscience concepts int heri coursework, and have placed a number of students into University and national laboratory research opportunities.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/17/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary P Halada"
