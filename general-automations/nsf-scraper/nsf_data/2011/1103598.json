 "awd_abstract_narration": "1103598 \r\n\t\r\nThis project supports a cooperative research project by Dr. Kevin Powers, University of Florida, Gainesville and Dr. Mohamed M. Rashad, Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute (CMRDI), Helwan, Egypt.  They plan to study a novel approach for fabrication technology of mullite nanoparticles from industrial wastes for advanced applications.  The objective is to develop advanced technologies to recycle and process silica effluents disposed from aluminum manufacturing in Egypt, silica fume from Ferro-silicon Alloys Company, Al dross from Egyptian Aluminum Company and aluminum effluents disposed from Egyptalum Company for the production of mullite nanoparticles 3Al2O3.2SiO2 used in refractory, electronic and optical applications. The technology to be developed is equally applicable to the U.S. industry centered in the Virginia/North Carolina and Georgia mining districts and has implications for the U.S. steelmaking industry. The technology depends on the formation of soluble solutions of sodium aluminate NaAlO2 and sodium silicate Na2SiO3 chemically treated under specified conditions. The effect of synthesis conditions, temperature, time, pH, molar ratio and the crystal modifiers on the crystal structure, size and microstructure will be studied and the optimum conditions determined. Moreover, the changes in the surface area SBET, DC resistivity, optical and mechanical properties will be measured. The research has the potential to transform undesirable by-products generated under current production methods into a high value added product for the mullite manufacturing industry. The educational aspects of the proposed work focus on the training of young Egyptian scientists in advanced characterization techniques and young U.S. scientists in the use of technological advances to improve the efficiency and sustainability of traditional mineral production practices. This project also brings together the international expertise of particles in USA (PERC) with the particle technology experts in Egypt (CMRDI). \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The dramatic increase in worldwide demand for steel and other industrial products brings with it a concurrent increased demand for mineral resources such as Kyanite, Andalusite, Sillimanite and Mullite used for refractories, glass, white wares and other ceramic products. The mining, refining and processing of these diminishing resources is intensive in energy and water use. The advanced methods investigated herein will lead to a greater understanding, greater efficiency and potential new uses for recycled industrial wastes and valuable end products. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Recycling what once was industrial waste into a marketable product is a natural avenue toward achieving sustainable energy and water use practices in both emerging and advanced industrialized countries. The techniques and processes developed under this proposal can be implemented in emerging economies and used to revitalize U.S. domestic production and practices in an environmentally responsible and economically feasible manner. The project will help educate Egyptian scientists in advanced characterization techniques and re-introduce traditional mineral engineering principles to a new generation of U.S. engineering students.\r\nThis proposal is supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program where NSF supports the US side and the Government of Egypt funds the Egyptian side.",

Millions of tons of these solid wastes are routinely discarded causing serious adverse effects to the environment. The aluminum and ferrosilicon alloy industries are no exception in this respect. In this project, US and Egyptian scientists have collaborated in exploring the use of hydrothermal techniques to produce mullite, with the ultimate goal of using waste products from the aluminum industry (aluminum dross) and the ferrosilican industry (silica fume).  Mullite is widely used commercially as a refractory material for the steel industry and as an optical or electronic material in hi tech ceramics.  A second major goal of this research was to encourage both  scientific and cultural exchange between the participants in Egypt and in the US.  Towards this end, the Particle Engineering Research Center at the University of Florida hosted an Egyptian graduate student for an extended exchange in addition to visits by Egyptian faculty.  In turn, US faculty visited Egypt to participate in program reviews and as a keynote speaker at the First International Conference on Advanced, Basic and Applied Sciences in November 2012.  The scientific outcomes include a greater understanding on the hydrothermal processing of mullite from silica and alumina precursors along with the potential use of these techniques for the synthesis of other ceramic materials. Due largely to the success of this program, the Egyptian Government has funded a continued exchange of Egyptian scientists to pursue this research further.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/14/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin Powers"
