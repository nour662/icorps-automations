 "awd_abstract_narration": "The college is enrolling cohorts of ten low-income students per year from groups historically underrepresented in science in this project entitled the \"Future Chemists Scholarships and Support\" (FoCuS) program. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The college has designed a curriculum, social activities and an advising infrastructure that support FoCuS scholars throughout their college careers. These efforts are designed to improve retention of the FoCuS scholars and all students in the chemical sciences beyond the first year of college. As FoCuS students matriculate, these students who are majoring in chemistry or biochemistry are being supported through several key activities: 1) scholarships; 2) a Summer Chemistry Bridge program; 3) intensive mentoring and advising; 4) cohort support systems and social activities; 5) leadership opportunities; 6) career exploration; 7) research opportunities and 8) an innovative chemistry curriculum.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: In order to fill the growing gap in the scientific workforce, the college is recruiting from groups currently underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematic (STEM) fields. This project is increasing retention of students majoring in the chemical sciences and has the potential to increase the diversity of students in the STEM workforce. The college has a long-standing interest in advising and mentoring students through cohort programs and is committed to improving diversity and providing access to education for financially needy students. For each of four years FoCuS is enrolling cohorts of 10 high achieving students from groups historically underrepresented in science. Thus, at least forty students are receiving direct funding and support, but all students enrolled in the chemistry major are benefiting from the redesigned chemistry major and support infrastructure. Results are being disseminated at conferences and through a publicly accessible website.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe College of St. Benedict/St. John?s University (CSB/SJU) Chemistry Department was funded to initiate an S-STEM program to enroll four cohorts of 10-15 low-income students from groups historically underrepresented in science in our program.  Our program, Future Chemists Scholarships and Support (FoCuS), began recruiting and enrolled the first cohort in the summer of 2012.  FoCuS scholars received scholarships and financial aid equivalent to an Honors Merit Scholarship as well as extra academic support, career exploration, leadership opportunities, and research support.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit \n\nThe CSB/SJU Chemistry Department designed a curriculum, social activities and an advising infrastructure to support FoCuS scholars (and all of our majors) throughout their college careers.  Students were supported through several key activities: 1) Scholarships; 2) Summer Chemistry Bridge program; 3) intensive mentoring and advising; 4) cohort support systems, outreach, and social activities; 5) leadership opportunities; 6) career exploration; 7) research opportunities and 8) our innovative chemistry curriculum.   \n\nThe FoCuS program yielded a 90% retention of the FoCuS scholars and we gained several insights into educational infrastructure that can support student retention.  As a result of this grant, we developed an extensive tutoring program that provided leadership opportunities for FoCuS students and supported all students enrolled in chemistry courses.  We are currently investigating the aspects of tutoring that can improve self-efficacy and identity as a scientist.  In addition, we created a scaffolded career development curriculum that includes early career exploration, intrusive advising, a new introduction to research methods course, and a graduate fellowship workshop.  These courses were developed for FoCuS students but all chemistry majors were allowed to participate.  These experiences have tremendously increased early access to research with approximately 75% of FoCuS students completing at least one summer internship and 50% obtaining a position after their first year.   Many of these students have continued on to present their work at regional and national conferences.  These practices have become institutionalized and will persist with the end of funding.\n\nThe PIs have presented our results at national conferences and published a paper in theJournal of Chemical Education on the aspects of our program that improved early entry to research, an activity shown to improve retention.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nIn order to fill the growing gap in the scientific workforce, we decided that we need to improve the scientific training of students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields.\n\nTo date, the FoCuS program has enrolled six cohorts of financially needy students with wide representation of women, first-generation and non-white students.  CSB/SJU has continued to fund two extra cohorts beyond the original NSF funded program.  All of these students received direct funding and support.     \n\nDue to the FoCuS program, we have successfully increased the number of majors in our department and we are also seeing an increase in numbers of women and students from underrepresented groups. This recruitment made a significant impact on the number of majors in our department and we are also seeing an increase in numbers of women and students from underrepresented groups.   For students who applied to the CSB/SJU chemistry or biochemistry major in the last three spring semesters, 50% were women for the first time ever.   In addition, 25% of applicants were non-white (above the campus average of 17%).\n\nOf the first three cohorts, 25 students have graduated from the FoCuS program and almost all have plans for graduate training or entry into the scientific workforce.  There are currently thirty-seven FoCuS scholars who will continue in the program in the upcoming years.\n\nThis project accomplished the goals of improving the recruitment and retention of students majoring in the chemical sciences at our school and these students are also contributing to the increase of diversity of students in the STEM workforce.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/02/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kate J Graham"
