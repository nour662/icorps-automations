The forum focuses on the costs of space weather impacts and the benefits of improved space weather services with an emphasis on the anticipated needs of the user community from 2011 to 2020. Space weather scientists and service providers seek to better understand and serve society's needs for space weather information. The desired outcome is actionable information to drive improved space weather science, products, services, and applications to serve a broad user community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSpace Weather Enterprise Forum 2011 theme:\nSolar Maximum:  Can We Weather the Storm?\nAs we approach the next peak of solar activity expected in 2013, our nation faces many uncertainties resulting from our increasing reliance on space weather-affected technologies for communication, navigation, security, and other activities, many of which underpin our national infrastructure and economy.  We also face increasing exposure to space weather-driven human health risk as trans-polar flights and space activities, including space tourism and space commercialization, increase. \nThe conference focused on sharing information and raising awareness for new users, decision makers, and policymakers in the following areas:New research resultsNew transitions of research into operationsNew products and servicesIntegrated, unified space weather operational capabilitiesInternational activities and cooperationCommercial space weather users and providersIntegration of social science into space weather services\nAttendees identified effective approaches to build resilience across society, particularly in critical infrastructure protection and support.  They also collected information to support a new National Space Weather Program Implementation Plan.\nThe Space Weather Enterprise Forum brought together the space weather community to share information and ideas among policymakers, senior government leaders, researchers, service- provider agencies, private-sector service providers, space weather information users, media, and legislators and staff from Capitol Hill to raise awareness of space weather and its effects on society.  The focus of the 2011 Space Weather Enterprise Forum was critical infrastructure protection, with the necessary underpinnings of research, improved products and services, and applications to serve a broad and growing user community.  The ultimate goal of the Space Weather Enterprise Forum is to improve the Nation\u00c6s ability to prepare for, avoid, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the potentially devastating impacts of space weather events on health, economy, and national security.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/11/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Meg Austin\nThe 2011 Space Weather Enterprise Forum (SWEF) was held in Washington, D.C., on June 21, 2011. The workshop was attended by approximately 220 representatives of the research and academic communities, industry, international stakeholder agencies, media, the Federal government and the military. Attendees collected information to support a new National Space Weather Program Implementation Plan.\n\nThe workshop included four sessions dedicated to the following topics:\n\n1. Critical infrastructure vulnerability to space weather\n\n2. Human safety and response preparedness\n\n3. Space weather warnings and prediction services\n\n4. Strategic communications, education, and outreach\n\nKey speakers included: Mr. Samuel P. Williamson, Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research; The Honorable Yvette D.

The results and findings from the 2011 SWEF will serve as input to the new National Space Weather Program Implementation Plan. Findings included the following:\n1. Due to our heavy reliance on a technological and space-enabled infrastructure, there is virtually no aspect of our lives that is not potentially affected by space weather.\n2. Significant impacts can occur any time during the solar cycle, not just at solar maximum. It is important to not overemphasize t..."
