 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Travis J. Williams of the University of Southern California is supported by the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop bifunctional homogeneous catalytic systems featuring a Lewis acid that functions primarily as a directing element to impart selectivity to hydride transfer reactions and a second metal as the hydride transfer catalyst.  The project includes mechanistic studies on the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane adduct and on the catalytic hydrogenation of spent ammonia borane.  Plans are outlined to study C-H functionalization reactions and to develop other Ru (II) and Fe (II) borates that might exhibit interesting catalytic chemistry.  \r\nIf successful, the project will facilitate the chemical transformation of hydrides with bifunctional catalytic systems.  The ability to manipulate hydride groups may significantly impact organic synthesis in general and hydrogen energy storage in particular.  A number of courses and hands-on training of graduate and undergraduate students in NMR spectroscopy will be developed and NMR spectroscopy will be introduced to local PUIs and high schools through a cyber-enabled NMR facility.",
