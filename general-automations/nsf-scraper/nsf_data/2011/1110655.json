 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many animals migrate during specific periods of the year, moving between wintering and breeding locations. Specifically this research will test the role of overwintering habitat quality in the timing of migration initiation, duration of migration and arrival at the breeding area, as well as ability of Black-and-white-warblers to compensate for the quality of the overwintering habitat while stopping at refugia to refuel during migration. This research will link the timing and distance of migration to subsequent reproductive success during the breeding period and ability to successfully survive the winter using the presence of stable isotopes in feathers and amount of plasma metabolites to quantify an individual's condition.  Information about the activity at the stopover areas will allow assessment of the carry-over of nutrients and condition between breeding, migration and overwintering and the integration of all phases of the annual life history cycle. These data will enhance our understanding of how the different phases of an individual's life cycle influence each other. In addition, the project will also provide cross-disciplinary biological training for graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMigration is a fundamental characteristic of the life history of many organisms allowing individuals to take advantage of different habitats as environments change seasonally.  Over two-thirds of all landbirds that breed in temperate North America fly thousands of kilometers to nonbreeding areas in Central and South America.
