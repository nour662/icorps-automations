Generally both copies are expressed equally but a small subset of genes is differentially expressed, with a dominant expression from one parent. These maternally or paternally silenced genes are called imprinted genes. Imprinted genes in plants are suggested to influence seed size and quality. To date, imprinting is only found in embryo and endosperm of plants, the two main components of a seed. These tissues are formed through double fertilization.

Genetic and molecular studies in plants have shown that presence or lost of DNA methylation regulates imprinted genes. DNA methylation is a well studied epigenetic mark that is associated with repression of genes and transposons without changing the underlying nucleotide sequences. Recently, we generated comprehensive single nucleotide maps of cytosine methylation and gene expression profiles in rice endosperm and embryo. In this study, we have identified a number of candidate imprinted genes. However, the mechanism by which these genes are selectively expressed in rice endosperm is still elusive. It has been suggested that imprinting is established in gametes and results in mono-allelic gene expression in endosperm and embryo after fertilization. Moreover, techniques to isolate gametes have been developed and optimized in many crop plants such as maize and rice. In order to unravel the question, I proposed to investigate DNA methylation in rice gametes. Through the EAPSI program, I have had an opportunity to collaborate with Dr. Takashi Okamoto, who is an expert in rice gamete isolation, in Tokyo Metropolitan University. The Okamoto lab has well established techniques for egg and sperm cell isolation.

Over 200 eggs and sperm cells and over 50 central cells were collected manually during the EAPSI program. The genomic DNA from these cells will be treated with sodium bisulfite and sequenced to generate a map of DNA methylation at single-nucleotide resolution at UC Berkeley. The generated dataset will be analyzed to identify the mechanism of imprinting in rice seeds.
