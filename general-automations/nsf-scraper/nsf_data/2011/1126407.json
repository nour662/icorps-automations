 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding will enable Clemson University to acquire a spectral confocal /multiphoton\r\nmicroscope equipped with a widefield spectral imaging system. The new system will be housed\r\nin the Jordan Hall Imaging Facility (JHIF), which is the advanced light microscopy core imaging\r\nfacility at Clemson University. The primary goal of the JHIF is to acquire and maintain advanced\r\nlight imaging equipment necessary for conducting leading edge research, thus, providing the\r\nClemson research community access to the tools necessary to compete with other top research\r\ninstitutions. As a core facility, the JHIF is dedicated to the training of investigators at all levels\r\nfrom undergraduate and graduate students to postdoctoral researchers. In keeping with the MRI\r\nNSF vision, this shared equipment would improve the quality and expand the scope of research\r\nat Clemson. The multiphoton capabilities will be utilized by Clemson researchers who work with\r\nlive cells and whole organisms, such as chick embryos, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans,\r\nas this technique provides high resolution image acquisition with less phototoxity and deeper\r\nresolution than conventional confocal microscopy. The widefield hyperspectral capabilities of\r\nthis instrument will benefit Clemson researchers currently engaged in nanoparticle studies,\r\nallowing them to not only visualize uptake of nanoparticles by cells in real time, but to also\r\nidentify chemical characteristics of these nanoparticles. The addition of these capabilities will\r\nsignificantly influence the quality of research in the fields of biological science, bioengineering,\r\n\r\nThe Clemson Jordan Hall Imaging Facility is dedicated to the training of undergraduate and\r\ngraduate researchers in advanced light microscopy techniques. In addition, the JHIF manager\r\nintroduces high school teachers to advanced light microscopy through SCLife summer courses,\r\ngiving them an opportunity to work with these techniques. To attract and assist underrepresented\r\ngroups in the sciences, the JHIF offers a minigrant program for up to 10 hours of beam time on\r\nthe instruments. The increased research scope that this microscope will bring to Clemson\r\nresearchers could result in enormous benefits to society, including protecting the environment,\r\nfood safety, new drug delivery systems, and safety from bioterrorism threats.",
