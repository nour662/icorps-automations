 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and test a novel media to remove phosphorus from waste water, a growing problem where new technology is needed.  Early test results of the proposed approach are promising; showing three times more capacity and longer life than alternatives used today, while being less expensive.  The media is a highly porous geoceramic containing nano-iron.  Early results show a distinctly different phosphorus removal pattern than other media.  This program will evaluate media performance and different filtration configurations.  Mechanisms for phosphorous capture will be examined in order to enhance removal rates and media life. Modeling will predict performance requirements and designs will be developed for field testing to be conducted under follow-on work.  Preliminary evaluations will be done for phosphorous recovery and regeneration of the media.\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are to provide effective approaches to address phosphorus water contamination problems that are a major cause of degradation of water in streams and lakes.  High phosphorous creates problems, such as toxic algae growth in lakes and degradation of natural areas, such as the Florida everglades.  Phosphorous comes from on-site wastewater systems and water runoff from agricultural and other locations.  Efficient, low maintenance technologies are needed to reduce discharge levels.  Media with a higher capacity and longer life can provide an economic alternative to mitigate the negative effects that phosphorous has on the environment, while possibly leading to ways of recovering the economic value of the phosphorous.",

Phosphorous comes from many sources, such as fertilizer used on lawns and by farmers to grow crops, food and animal wastes, and industrial sources.  When it accumulates in water, it often leads to excessive growth of algae that can make lake and ponds unsafe for swimming and boating and can lower oxygen in water, which kills fish.  \nCurrent technology to remove or control phosphorus is ineffective or cost-prohibitive for treating many water sources.  This SBIR project was successful in developing a unique porous ceramic media that uses nanomaterials to capture phosphorus.  This new material absorbs more phosphorous per pound and does it faster than other media.  Testing showed it to be at least 3 times better.  The media has a long life and once it stops removing phosphorous, a method was developed to regenerate the media so it can be used again.  Working with Michigan State University, testing was done using water from septic systems and from other sources that shows the high performance of this new media.   Applications are widespread, ranging from control of phosphorous in waste treatment water and removal from ponds and lakes. It can be used to take phosphorous from animal and agricultural waste water, stormwater runoff, and industrial sources.  \nFunding from the National Science Foundation has led to a new economically affordable environmental media for removing phosphorous from water with much higher capacity and longer life.  This media can mitigate the negative effects on the environment and offer ways of recovering the economic value of the phosphorous.  Further improvements in the product are feasible and testing for many of the possible applications is needed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard Helferich"
