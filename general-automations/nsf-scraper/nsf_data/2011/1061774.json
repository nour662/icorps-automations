 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's request funding to build, test and implement an instrument (Submersible Incubation Device-In Situ Microbial Sampler (SID-ISMS) that will satisfy the current requirements for water column sampling for studies in molecular microbial ecology & biogeochemical element cycling in the marine environment. This instrumentation will make possible autonomous in situ, time series measurements of critical microbially-driven rate processes in conjunction with contemporaneous sampling (in situ sample preservation) of the environment at the same location to allow association of measured activities with the identity and function of the catalyzing organisms. New developments will include a 2L incubation chamber for tracer rate measurements, a new Fixation Filter Unit allowing in situ chemical preservation of filtered samples without need for external electromechanical support for preservative delivery & incorporation of a SDSL data.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:     \r\n\r\nGrad-students and post-docs will likely have the experience to work with this new technology and the samples it collects during the sea trials will contribute to graduate theses. It's quite likely that this technology will recover genetic material that is new to science and produce revised rate measurements for the entire range of biogeochemical measurements that could be conducted in the SID module. The use of WHOI and CMORE outreach programs to promote the new sampling/collection technology will ensure exposure to other underrepresented groups with an interest in pursuing careers in science. This new tool should enable scientists to move to the next level of understanding aquatic ecosystems and not simply 'settle' for the available technology, which currently limits scientific creativity.",
