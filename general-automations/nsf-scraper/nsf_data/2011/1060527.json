The project aims to improve educational opportunities for STEM students, increase the retention of STEM students to degree achievement and/or transfer, and enhance student support programs for STEM students. The scholarship recipients are working with faculty mentors, student services advisors specific to scholarship recipients, and fellow students to engage in a variety of program activities designed to provide academic, professional and personal growth opportunities. The project helps the scholarship recipients, including first-generation students and underrepresented minority students, complete an AS degree and/or transfer to a baccalaureate degree-granting institution. The resulting S-STEM education model is being disseminated to and shared with other community colleges and post-secondary schools in the Denver region.",
