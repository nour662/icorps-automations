 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Stanford University facilitates scientific research using the large new computational resource named Blue Waters scheduled to be deployed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \r\n\r\nThe PI will investigate membrane fusion, the process by which neuronal exocytosis and infection by enveloped viruses occur.  This mechanism has been notoriously difficult to characterize at a molecular level. Part of the problem is that the underlying reaction that fusion proteins catalyze is not fully understood. The development of robust predictive models for the mechanism of lipid membrane fusion and its catalysis by viral fusion proteins will greatly aid in the understanding of the underlying physical process and how to effectively target it with antiviral agents.  Simulations on Blue Waters will be performed using the Gromacs software package.\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute substantially to the development of peta-scale molecular dynamics simulation software, the integration of tightly-coupled supercomputers with distributed computing, and our understanding of membrane fusion. Molecular dynamics is poised on the edge of a seminal expansion in its capability to make computational predictions of chemical kinetics and mechanism for biomolecules. This project aims to realize the vision of making such predictions for complex systems of physiological relevance. Such entails not merely scaling to systems of larger size but developing analytic methodology for complex reactions. The collaborative team includes developers of both the GROMACS simulation software and the Folding@Home simulation and analysis platform. Simulation and analysis methodology developed as part of this project will be shared with the scientific community in the form of improvements to the publicly available GROMACS software and the open-source software packages on the SimTK website.",
