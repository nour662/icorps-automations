 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year renewal REU Site program at Northwestern University(NU)in Nanoscale Science and Engineering will support a diverse group of ten undergraduates from colleges and universities around the country in meaningful hands-on nanoscale science and engineering focused research for a 9 week period over the summer. The program will be enhanced by educationl activities including technical writing and professional speaking workshops, an ethics seminar,weekly meetings/seminars,and a field trip to Argonne National Laboratory. At the close of the program, participants will have opportunities; to their enhanced skills to use at the Closing Symposium,and by writing and submitting a paper for possible publication in Nanoscape: The Journal for Undergraduate Research in Nanoscience or professional technical journals. The site program builds upon nine years of experience developing and providing meaningful hands-on research and educational opportunities for undergraduates from around the country through the NU Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center(NSEC).\r\n\r\nThe program will empower a diverse group of students, enable them to complete a summer research project and prepare them for graduate education. Recruitment efforts will target underrepresented minorities and women.  Already established partnerships, which have resulted in a highly diverse participant population in the past, will be continued for this program.  These partnerships include, the Illinois Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP), Chicago State University, and Harold Washington College.  Additional program recruitment efforts include attendance at annual recruitment fairs and society conferences (e.g., The National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), direct mailing of promotional posters to a list of 114 historically Black colleges around the country, and disseminating internet program announcements through the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans (SACNAS), the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES), the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), NSBE, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), Mexican-American Engineers Society (MAES), and the Association for Women in Science (AWIS). Results will be disseminated broadly through the Nanoscape journal and other professional publications.  The inclusion of undergraduates in the nanoscience and engineering research at NU will help to advance the research to applications that have the potential to significantly benefit society.",

Hersam, Northwestern University \n \nOutcome:        The NU REU Site advanced the knowledge and research skills of undergraduate researchers.  The significance of the program is clear when examining the program exit survey results.  A majority of students reported that the program had expanded their knowledge of scientific fields, enhanced their readiness for demanding research, and improved their laboratory techniques and communication skills.\n \nImpact/Benefit:  Overall, the NU REU Site encouraged students to consider careers in science and engineering by emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of nanoscale science, chemistry, materials science, and medicine, and enabling access to world-class research opportunities in Nanoscale Science and Engineering.\n \nExplanation:      There is a critical need for the creation of a strong workforce of world-class scientists, engineers, and educators with competencies in interdisciplinary nanoscience and nanotechnology research.  The REU Site in Nanoscale Science and Engineering at Northwestern University (NU) program uniquely equipped undergraduate students with hands-on, interdisciplinary research opportunities to broaden participation in nanoscale research.  The NU REU Site supported 30 undergraduate students, from colleges and universities around the country, in a diverse array of meaningful nanoscale science and engineering research projects. \n\n\nNU REU participants were a demographically diverse group.  47% of participants were female, and 53% were underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities.  A broad range of educational institutions were also represented, with 37% of the participating students from smaller schools with limited research opportunities.\n \nFrom 2011-2013 during the nine week summer program, each participant was assigned a research project under the careful guidance of a faculty advisor, and graduate student or postdoctoral associate mentor, who was actively involved in the daily supervision and mentoring of their assigned undergraduates. The program included a full-day public speaking workshop, a series of writing workshops to build communication skills, an ethics seminar, field trip, and a graduate school panel discussion to encourage interest in continuing education.  Participants presented final project results at a formal Closing Symposium, and final papers were submitted for potential publication in a peer-reviewed journal, Nanoscape: The Journal of Undergraduate Research in Nanotechnology and other publications.  \n\n\nStudents describe the NU REU Site as a life-changing experience.  One student\u00c6s exit survey comments stated: \"I would describe this experience as being fulfilling.  There were many cases in which I was surprised by the breadth of this program.\" Another student said: \"Everything I learned is applicable to life in grad school and beyond.  I wouldn\u00c6t trade this experience for anything.\" Finally, another undergraduate commented: \"Amazing.  I couldn\u00c6t have asked for a better experience.  Any student interested in graduate research should apply to a program like this one.\"\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/01/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark C Hersam"
