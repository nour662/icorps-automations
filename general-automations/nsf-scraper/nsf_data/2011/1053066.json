The instrumentation combination will be used to assess electrical resistivity, microgravity, and conductivity to assess geologic unit structure. Additional structural information will be gathered by ground penetrating radar. Failure surfaces, giving way to landslides will be assessed using the refraction micotremor device. Void detection in subsurface karst systems will be another major research thrust for the new instrumentation. Collaborative efforts in site characterizations, archaeological site surveys, groundwater delineations and other environmental subsurface studies will also make use of the new instrumentation. The geophysical instrumentation will be integrated into the Physics, Geology and Engineering Technologies Department curricula to foster undergraduate research opportunities and applied hands-on job related experience. This instrumentation will offer educational training for eventual graduate research and/or the job market and support underrepresented groups. Stratigraphy, Environmental Geology, Groundwater, Soil Science, and Geomorphology are a few of the envisioned disciplines which will be enhanced with this equipment. The geophysical instrumentation will be used in classes to expose students to modern techniques and equipment uncommon in primary undergraduate institutions. \r\n\r\n***",
