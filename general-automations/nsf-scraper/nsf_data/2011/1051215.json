 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Geraldine Richmond of the University of Oregon. Prof. Richmond and her research group will employ non-linear optical methods in combination with supporting particle size and zeta potential measurements and molecular dynamic simulations to is to provide molecular level insights into absorptive and reactive processes at the interface of aqueous solutions in contact with oils, gases, and macromolecular systems. The studies focus on: i) understanding the behavior of surfactants, polymers and dispersants at planar and particle interfaces between water and an organic liquid (oil); and ii) understanding the adsorption, solvation and reactivity of gases and small organic molecules on the surface of aqueous solutions. \r\n\r\nMolecular level understanding of the water/oil interface will enable better assessment and prediction of environmental damage due to oil spills like the 2010 Deep Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The study will provide excellent training opportunities to students and postgraduates who seek training in the area of environmental interface chemistry. Prof. Richmond and her students will carry out extensive outreach activities to explain the importance of their research to the general public and continue their on-going activities to broaden participation of women and minorities in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:  Aqueous surfaces are ubiquitous on our planet and play a key role in many environmentally relevant processes of concern today.  These surfaces serve as platforms for both reactive and non-reactive interactions, driving interest in interfacial chemistry in the atmosphere and also for how to disperse and clean-up oil spills. This research at air/water interfaces has provided new molecular insights into how several important atmospheric gases such as sulfur dioxide, and low molecular weight organics such as diacids adsorb and react at water surfaces relevant to atmospheric processes.  The studies of the interface between an oily liquid and an aqueous solution have shown how several common surfactants similar to those used in oil remediation, adsorb and assemble at this interface and how metal ions affect this adsorption.  The studies have employed a combination of experimental vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS) and theoretical molecular dynamic simulations and ab initio calculations to provide a thorough molecular picture of interfacial phenomena. \n\n \n\nBroader Impact:  There are many ways in which this research effort has had an impact beyond the Richmond laboratory.  The research results have been presented at institutions across the U.S. and have also been part of Richmond\u00c6s effort to increase the research capacity in many developing countries in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia.  In particular, the research involving water has become part of two different projects; (1)  to bring women scientists from the U.S. and Latin America around the issue of water as it relates to natural disasters and (2) to develop collaborations between women scientists in the U.S. and countries in Africa around the topic of water resources and security.  This later project entitled Partnership for Women in Water in Engineering and Research (POWWER) has allowed U.S. women scientists to develop international collaborations while also getting a better understanding of problems that will likely be facing the U.S. in the future. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/21/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Geraldine L Richmond"
