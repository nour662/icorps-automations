 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human-induced global change is altering most ecosystems on Earth. Highly diverse ecosystems may be better buffered against change, maintaining key functions even as the physical environment changes. How ecosystems respond will likely depend on their biodiversity, but how different components of biological diversity determine ecosystem responses to global change are still poorly understood. Genetic diversity enhances the ability of populations to adapt to change and functional diversity allows different species to carry out key ecosystem functions, but little is known about how these components of diversity will interact with each other and with the number of species present in a changing environment. Sixty years of existing ecological data, field sampling, genetic analyses, experiments, and  mathematical models will be used by an interdisciplinary team of researchers to examine multiple aspects of biodiversity in the largest, oldest and most biologically diverse lake in the world, Lake Baikal in Siberia. A major goal of the project will be to develop the ability to predict how this ecosystem will respond to rising temperatures and other stressors. Holding 20% of world's unfrozen fresh water, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is recognized internationally as a globally important freshwater resource, a treasure trove of biodiversity, and a unique natural laboratory in which to study evolution. With an unprecedented diversity of endemic species found nowhere else, Lake Baikal serves as a model for ecosystems with highly unique biota and cold aquatic environments undergoing rapid warming.\r\n\r\nResearchers and students will engage in an interdisciplinary international collaborative research program. Funding will support graduate training in both applied and basic areas of science, including molecular biology, ecology, and informatics. Data collected by this project will be publicly available so that they can be used by other scientists and educators. Project results will be communicated to environmental organizations in Russia and the US and to a US-based film team planning an IMAX movie about Baikal and freshwater conservation. School teachers from Michigan, Texas and Tennessee will participate in the project and, together with researchers, develop educational activities on aquatic ecology, biological diversity and global change.",

Located in a remote region in Siberia, almost half of the plants and animals in the lake are endemic - found nowhere else in the world - and many are adapted to a very cold life. This collaborative project set out to characterize how biodiversity in Lake Baikal would be affected by the rapid warming now occurring in the lake, by studying the genetic, functional and taxonomic diversity of the plankton at the base of the food web, in partnership with Russian researchers. Will the cold-loving endemic plankton have enough genetic diversity, and are their tolerances to temperature broad enough to allow them to persist in warming waters, or will the plankton become dominated by the most common types of plankton that are found elsewhere in the world? While Michigan State University, Eastern Tennessee State University, University of Texas at Austin, and Wellesley College led various aspects of molecular, field and laboratory work focused on genetic and functional diversity, at University of California Santa Barbara, researchers led the analysis of a 60-year plankton data set that provides insight into long-term dynamics of endemic and non-endemic plankton species. This data set was collected by researchers at Irkutsk State University in Russia, at a single research station in the Southern basin of the lake, and it demonstrates that plankton populations have changed with rising temperatures over this time period. As summers get warmer, some cold-adapted endemic plankton are moving lower in the water and as winter ice cover gets shorter, the timing of the under-ice blooms of endemic plankton is getting later, both of which could change the food web over time. The role of winter weather conditions in creating ice that is clear enough for large plankton blooms to occur under ice was also elucidated; if the weather is not calm and very cold when ice formation begins, ice may be cloudier, reducing light available for the big blooms of ice-adapted endemic plankton that feed organisms under ice. Collaboration with Wellesley College and Siberian partners on the first analysis of a separate 25-year Russian plankton data set that spans the entire lake during the summer revealed that analyses of the 60-year data set are representative of the Southern basin in this enormous inland sea, but may be underestimating the change occurring with warming across the Central and Northern basins of the lake. Lakewide summer temperatures have increased more rapidly than previously reported, with concurrent increases in the abundance of plankton that are not endemic to Lake Baikal. The increasing occurrence of non-endemic species in Lake Baikal could precipitate food web changes as the lake continues to warm. These non-endemic plankton species are functionally different from endemic species; for example, non-endemic zooplankton have different food preferences and temperature tolerances than those of endemic zooplankton. As warming increases in Siberia, shifts in the balance of endemic and non-endemic species may be expected to continue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/01/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stephanie&nbsp;E&nbsp;Hampton</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1136637/1136637_10136316_1454338501857_baikalstillbow--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1136637/1136637_10136316_1454338501857_baikalstillbow--rgov-800width...",
