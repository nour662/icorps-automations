 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use in vitro three-dimensional (3D) cell culturing enabled by the magnetic levitation method (MLM) as an improved tool for toxicity testing. This work will probe the effects of common agents on the lung, liver and kidney, three organs that play a central role in drug metabolism and are predisposed to toxic injury. 2D cell culture, commonly utilized for testing the cytotoxic effects of drugs, displays limited accuracy in predicting toxicity in vivo due to fundamental differences in the cellular microenvironment. While better representations of the 3D architecture of in vivo tissue are provided by animal models, they fail to accurately reflect whether or not drugs will cause cellular damage in humans as a result of biological differences between species. Our preliminary data shows that magnetic levitation maintains cells in culture in an arrangement that allows the cells to develop and communicate in a manner that is much closer to the in vivo environment than other in vitro systems.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are to improve assessment of drug toxicity and chemical hazards, reduce the use of animals, and advance the fields of in vitro toxicology testing and drug discovery. Commercial potential includes expansion of the device into high-throughput screening, generation of a prototype of a gas delivery system with capabilities to perform live cell microscopy, and development of a label-free viability assay for drug discovery and toxicity testing.",

The motivation for this project was the lack of in vitro cell culture models in toxicology that could accurately predict human in vivo responses. Toxicity has until recently been screened with animal models, as they can closely mimic human responses. However, animal testing is low-throughput, costly, and because they are a different species, may not adequately represent human responses. Additionally, there have been recent pushes to reduce animal testing, such as the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) and the NTP Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Testing Methods (NICEATM) by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).</p>\n<p>As a result, researchers have increasingly looked towards in vitro alternatives. Most in vitro models utilize 2D cell monolayers on stiff substrates that poorly represent native tissue environments. 3D models have recently gained prominence as they can recreate tissue structure and function in vitro. However, these still novel platforms suffer from technical limitations in speed and handling that have so far prevented their widespread adoption. Thus, there exists a demand for a 3D cell culture platform that accurately models in vivo toxicity, and is rapid and easy to handle for toxicity screening.</p>\n<p>Towards that end, this SBIR focused on developing 3D cell culture platforms to overcome these hurdles, magnetic levitation and magnetic 3D bioprinting (Fig.1). The core principle behind these platforms is the magnetization of cells, then aggregation and direction of these cells with magnetic forces. Magnetization is accomplished by the incubation of cells with NanoShuttleTM (NS), a biocompatible nanoparticle assembly consisting of gold, iron oxide, and poly-L-lysine (PLL). NS magnetizes cells by electrostatically attaching to cell membranes via PLL. Once magnetized, cells can be aggregated into 3D structures in two ways: magnetic levitation, where a magnet above a multiwell plate pulls cells off the stiff substrate to aggregate in levitation; or magnetic 3D bioprinting, where a multiwell plate of magnetized cells is placed atop an array of magnets that pull magnetized cells down to aggregate at the bottom on a cell-repellent surface. In both cases, the magnetic forces rapidly aggregate the cells, which interact with each other to build a larger 3D structure with extracellular matrix (ECM) that mimics native tissue structure. In this platform, we can design accurate tissue models (Fig.2) that predict human toxicity with speed, ease, and fine spatial organization.</p>\n<p>We demonstrated our ability to create models by designing and assembling a co-culture model of the bronchiole wall using magnetic levitation and tool for co-culture assembly and the transfer of cultures. Additionally, we expanded the throughput of magnetic levitation to 6-well and 24-well plates. From this foundation, we expanded the applications into both lung and kidney, developed high-throughput magnetic 3D bioprinting kits (Fig.3), and a novel assay for screening in 3D. Furthermore, we developed an iPod-based imaging system to image and analyze our structures macroscopically and improve throughput and efficiency in toxicity screening (Fig.4).</p>\n<p>As part of this project effort, n3D developed relationships with local colleges, placing its technology into a scientific teaching environment. Such relationships were greatly facilitated by NSF SBIR supplemental funding programs, such as Phase IICC and Phase IIA. For example, n3D worked closely with Lone Star Community College to establish Nano3D&rsquo;s technology as part of their laboratory academic curriculum. The Lone Star Community College personnel has been fully trained and is implementing magnetic 3D cell culturing as part of their teaching curriculum.
