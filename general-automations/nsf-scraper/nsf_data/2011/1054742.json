 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division supports Professor Gary E. Douberly at the University of Georgia for a combined high resolution infrared laser spectroscopy and helium nanodroplet isolation (HENDI) study aimed at probing isolated amino acids, model di- and tri-peptides and nucleic acid base species.  These investigations will provide detailed structural information for these biologically important systems.  This methodology will also be employed to determine with high accuracy the thermochemistry associated with the interconversion of biomolecule conformers and tautomers.  To address the role solvent plays in driving conformational changes in biomolecules, HENDI will be used to determine the structures of biomolecule-water clusters upon successive addition of water.  These measurements will provide definitive tests for the theories that are needed to interpret the experimental studies of bio-macromolecular dynamics, such as those that probe the structural changes of a protein as it folds in its native environment.  Collectively, these studies will contribute critically needed benchmarks for the calibration and testing of the molecular modeling and quantum chemistry methods that are presently used across a vast array of fields in chemistry, physics and materials science.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on the fundamental structural properties of isolated biomolecules, which will have a broader impact on a wide array of studies aimed at understanding the function and chemistry of biomolecular systems.  The broader impacts of this research also include the training of graduate and undergraduate students in the use of advanced laser technologies, optics, electronics, vacuum systems, and cryogenic techniques.  In order to involve students from underrepresented groups, partnerships will be established with chemistry faculty at historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the state of Georgia.  Professor Douberly will present seminars and lectures on biophysical spectroscopy on an annual basis at these institutions.  Undergraduate students from these HBCUs will travel to the University of Georgia to participate in the research activities carried out under this award.  Each year, student participants will present their results at regional scientific meetings.  Professor Douberly will serve as a mentor and advisor to student participants during their research activities, as they navigate through the graduate or professional school application process, and beyond into their professional careers.  The anticipated outcome will be to encourage students from this underrepresented group to pursue advanced education in the physical sciences.",

A common theme of the spectroscopic work carried out under this award is the comparison of high accuracy experimental measurements to emerging theoretical methods in computational quantum chemistry.
