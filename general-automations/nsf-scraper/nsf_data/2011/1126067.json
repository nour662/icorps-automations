 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a new multi-user multi-institutional research instrument -- a magnetized dusty plasma device. The device would be housed at Auburn University (Auburn, Alabama). The PI (Edward Thomas, African American) from Auburn University, heads a strong team of co-PIs including Marlene Rosenberg (female) from University of California, San Diego, and Robert Merlino from the University of Iowa (EPSCoR state).  This project combines the integrated development of a superconducting, high magnetic field (|B|  = 4 Tesla) system, a flexible, multiconfiguration plasma chamber and plasma source, a novel nanoparticle imaging system, and an advanced, network-based control system to create a unique, research device that will be the premier instrument of its type in the dusty plasma research community. This project is the culmination of over two years of international development activity. This effort has leveraged the expertise of the entire dusty plasma research community as well as involving researchers with interests in fusion, astrophysics, and fluid mechanics, and thus provides strong evidence that this community will embrace this project and make use of this new resource. Moreover, this proposed project is transformational in that, once operational, this device will allow access to regimes of dusty plasma behavior that have previously been inaccessible, which provides additional motivation for broad community support for this project. Investigations of grain charging (e.g., ion/electron gyro-orbits less than inter-grain distances), wave phenomena (e.g., electrostatic dust cyclotron wave), magnetic field effects on dust transport (e.g., g[vector] \u00d7B[vector] drift), and the behavior of plasma with embedded paramagnetic particles are new scientific topics that will be enabled by this device.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlasmas (i.e., ionized gases) are a fourth state of matter consisting of negatively charged electrons, positively charged ions, and neutral atoms.  If small, particulate matter is introduced into a plasma, these microparticles &ndash; also called \"dust\" particles - can become charged by the ions and electrons in the background plasma and create a fourth species in the plasma.  This new, four-component plasma system is known as a \"dusty\" or a \"complex\" plasma. \n\nFor over three decades, researchers have been studying dusty plasmas.  These studies range from space and astrophysical environments, such as Saturn\u00c6s rings or the tails of comets, to laboratory settings where dust particles can form in the plasmas and can be a type of contaminant in plasma processing of microelectronics or in fusion plasmas.  From these studies, emerged a new subfield of plasma physics research dedicated to experimental and theoretical the study of dusty plasmas.\n\nHowever, In many astrophysical and terrestrial laboratory plasmas, magnetic fields are present.  In a plasma with charged dust grains, the magnetic field will alter the interaction between the dust and plasma.  Because of the ubiquity of plasmas, dust, and magnetic fields in cosmic and terrestrial environments, understanding the basic physics of a fully magnetized dusty plasma is of fundamental scientific interest. \n\nTherefore, the goal of this project has been to development of a new class of research instrument &ndash; a magnetized dusty plasma device &ndash; that will enable laboratory investigations of phenomena relevant to plasma physics, astrophysics, fusion and fluid systems.\n\nIntellectual merit:  The intellectual merit of this proposal is the design, construction, and operation of a device with the scientific mission to study the coupling between neutrals, ions, electrons, and charged microparticles in a fully magnetized plasma environment in which the magnetic force is comparable to the other forces that are acting upon the dust grain.  This device, the Magnetized Dusty Plasma Experiment (MDPX), is a 3-ton, 4 Tesla class, superconducting magnet that is capable of generating both uniform and non-uniform magnetic fields.  It is the only device in the United States &ndash; and one of 6 in the world &ndash; dedicated to the study of magnetized dusty plasmas.\n\nBroader impact:  The development of the MDPX device has provided excellent training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral researchers with backgrounds in physics and engineering.  Additionally, as a one-of-a-kind device that will be used as a multi-user research instrument, the MDPX device has brought a unique capability to the host institution, Auburn University, that enhances its research infrastructure.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward E Thomas"
