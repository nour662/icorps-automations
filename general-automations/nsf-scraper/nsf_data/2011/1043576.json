 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antarctic channichthyid icefishes are stunning examples of the unique physiological traits that can arise during evolution in a constantly cold environment. Icefishes are the only vertebrates that as adults, lack the circulating oxygen-binding protein hemoglobin (Hb); several species within this family also lack the intracellular oxygen-binding protein myoglobin (Mb) in their heart ventricle. The loss of Hb and Mb has resulted in striking modifications in the cardiovascular system to ensure adequate tissue oxygenation, some of which are energetically costly. Recent indicate there may be at least one benefit to not expressing these heme-centered proteins - oxidized proteins and lipids are higher in red-blooded notothenioids compared to icefishes. The research will address the hypothesis that the loss of Hb and Mb reduces oxidative stress in icefishes compared to red-blooded notothenioid fishes, resulting in a lower rate of protein turnover and energetic cost savings. Specifically, the project will (1)  Characterize levels of oxidative stress in red- and white-blooded notothenioid fishes, (2) Determine if red- and white-blooded notothenioids differ in their regulation of iron, (3) Determine if lower levels of oxidized proteins in icefishes result in lower rates of protein turnover and energetic cost savings, and (4) Determine if oxygen-binding proteins promote oxidative stress in-vivo and in-vitro.\r\n\r\nThe results will contribute to the understanding of iron-catalyzed oxidative stress, which is associated with the progression of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, the research will increase understanding of factors related to iron metabolism and oxidative stress in notothenioid fishes that may have played key roles in the success of channichthyid icefishes. The broader impacts include development of a website will enable teachers and students to learn more about the fascinating biology of Antarctic icefishes, as well as the impacts of global climate change and commercial fishing activities on Antarctic fishes. Additionally, Alaska Native high school and undergraduate students will be involved in research at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit.  Oxidative stress represents an imbalance between an organism?s regular production of potentially deleterious, oxygen-centered \"free radicals\" and its natural defenses (i.e., \"antioxidant\" capacities).  Our current work stems from reports dating back 50 years that the iron-centered oxygen-binding protein, hemoglobin, whose major function is to transport oxygen through the circulatory system, can facilitate the generation of both oxygen- and iron-based radicals.   \n\nAntarctic icefishes (family Channichthyidae) are the only adult vertebrate animals that do not express the protein hemoglobin. In the decades since the discovery of these remarkable animals, the loss of hemoglobin in icefishes has raised questions concerning the lack of hemoglobin and whether it is associated with detriments, or potential benefits to physiological function.  We explore the central question of whether icefishes, in contrast with most Antarctic notothenioid fishes who do possess hemoglobin, are less likely to sustain additional costs associated with requirements for a robust system of antioxidant defense, and/or repair of damaged proteins and lipids (i.e., fats).  We hypothesize that the loss of hemoglobin may, in fact, represent a physiological advantage for icefishes.  Antarctic notothenioid fishes provide a natural experiment to examine questions pertaining to risks and prevention of damage by \"free radicals\" at very low temperatures, and the contributions of hemoglobin to these processes.\n\nOur results clearly demonstrate that the loss of hemoglobin in Antarctic icefishes does not confer a physiological advantage by reducing levels of oxidative stress.  While in some tissues, the expression of hemoglobin is correlated with both high levels of oxidative damage and capacities for antioxidant defense, in other cases the species that lack hemoglobin display the highest levels of macromolecules damaged by oxidative injury.  In addition, we find no significant differences in rates of protein degradation or synthesis between fishes lacking or expressing hemoglobin.

We originally predicted that the absence of hemoglobin in icefishes would require the expansion of proteins involved in iron transport and sequestration in order to prevent unwanted oxidation reactions catalyzed by unchaperoned iron.  In no case, however, did we find higher concentrations of proteins involved in iron processing among icefishes compared with those found in red-blooded species.\n\nModifications to the cardiovascular system accompany loss of hemoglobin in icefishes.
