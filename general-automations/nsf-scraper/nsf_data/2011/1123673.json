 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jamie Shenton (Doctoral student, Vanderbilt University), under the guidance of Dr. Beth A. Conklin, will investigate indigenous women's changing body images in Monda\u00f1a, a Quichua community in the Ecuadorian Amazon.  As a result of dramatic changes in the 21st century, political and professional horizons for indigenous women have widened promoting their empowerment.  Access to a wide range of new media and commercial influences have presented new physical role models. For young Quichua women, these new forms of self-presentation compete with the more \"traditional\" identities of older generations of women who define themselves through domestic activities focused on producing crops, food, and children.  \r\n\r\nThrough intensive interviews, participant observation, and quantitative body image assessments, this research aims to document (1) how new media and consumer options influence indigenous women's relations to their bodies; and (2) how gender ideals and roles are changing as young Quichua women in Monda\u00f1a respond to opportunities for education and careers on one hand, and new models of femininity on the other.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates theories of media influences and consumer culture as homogenizing forces.  However, anthropological research shows that people in developing countries interpret media messages and foreign ideas to fit their own cultural values and personal identities.  This study aims to understand how Quichua women interpret and pursue beauty images in cultural context.  The significance of the research lies in how body image concerns compete with or complement other values and aspirations as young women - a critical source of human capital - make educational, career and ultimately health choices that will shape the future of their families and communities.",

In many rural communities in Latin America and elsewhere, native women and girls have new opportunities for education, employment, professional advancement, and participatory citizenship.  At the same time, new media, telecommunications, and consumer goods have transformed other aspects of social life.  This research project documents these changes a small Quichua community in the Ecuadorian Amazon called Sacha Loma (pseudonym), based on 12 months of ethnographic field research.  It explores intergenerational changes in female identities, perceptions of well-being, and aspirations for the future, focusing on the pressures and incentives Quichua youth experience in relation to the \"western\" body ideals promoted in new media, advertising, and interactions with outsiders.  Much of the literature on the global spread of western body ideals via media and consumer culture sees these as poisonous and corrupting, misdirecting female energies and creating preconditions for eating disorders and other psychological problems.  This project examines how one community of native women interpret and respond to these ideals in context, emphasizing how changing self-images relate to individuals\u00c6 aspirations for themselves, their families, and communities.\n\n Utilizing mixed methods&mdash;participant observation, interviews, focus groups, and surveys&mdash;the Co-PI (Shenton) explored how aspirational goals of health, morality, and empowerment are interwoven with notions of body and identity.

For both generations, women\u00c6s role as producers is firmly rooted in their bodies.  Changing body images reflect changing aspirations&mdash;from the ideal of sturdy farm bodies to stylish student bodies&mdash;directed to similar goals of individual empowerment and family and community well-being.  Like their elders, young Quichua women see their bodies as productive resources. Where elder women wanted strong bodies to produce food and healthy children, young women who desire education, employment, and political participation now seek thinner, \"whiter,\" more westernized body images.
