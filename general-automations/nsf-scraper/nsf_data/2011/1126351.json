 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is one of 16 Rapid Response (RAPID) projects funded as the result of a Dear Colleague Letter (NSF 11-006) encouraging diagnostic analyses of climate model simulations prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5). Research conducted in these projects is expected to lead to more detailed model intercomparisons, better understanding of robust model behaviors, and better understanding and quantification of uncertainty in future climate simulations.  \r\n\r\nThis project examines the secular trend in the Atlantic interhemispheric sea surface temperature (SST) gradient occuring in 20th century observations and climate model simulations. Observations show a trend in the gradient in which the Southern Hemisphere tropical SSTs warm faster than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts.  Previous work using an earlier ensemble of climate model simulations suggested that the SST gradient trend is forced in part, perhaps predominantly, by the radiative effects of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols. The behavior of the SST gradient trend in simulations prepared for the AR5 is of particular interest because the new generation of models incorporates significant advances in the simulation of both direct and indirect effects of aerosols.  In this project, research focuses on 1) quantifying the magnitude of the SST gradient trend, and assessing the spread in the trend across the different multimodel ensemble members; 2) attributing the cause of the trend; 3) assessing the role of aerosol indirect effects in determining the magnitude of the trend; 4) determining the relative roles of different aerosol types in forcing the trend, particularly sulfate aerosols and black carbon; and 5) understanding the flattening of the trend in the late 20th century.  The primary method for identifying the aerosol radiative contribution to the trend consists of comparisons between model simulations forced with all 20th-century climate forcings (including aerosols) and simulations in which only the 20th century increases in greenhouse gas concentrations are used as forcing.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the project lies in its support of the IPCC AR5, which is intended to provide information on climate change and its consequences to decision makers worldwide. The Atlantic SST gradient exerts a significant influence on the climate of the surrounding landmasses, and is implicated in droughts over the Sahel and northeastern Brazil.  The extent to which the SST gradient trend is forced by aerosols, and if so which aerosols are most responsible, is thus of great societal relevance to these regions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLong-term Trends of the Atlantic Interhemispheric SST Gradient in the CMIP5 20th Century Simulations\n\nThe Atlantic Interhemispheric sea surface temperature (SST) gradient is the difference in the ocean surface temperature between the North and South Tropical Atlantic (Fig 1).  This gradient exerts strong control over tropical rainfall in the Atlantic sector including the Sahel, the Amazon, and the rainband over the tropical Atlantic (the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ).  Generally speaking, the ITCZ 'likes' the warmer hemisphere.  So, it is important to understand what controls its change.  \n\nIt turns out that on timescales of a few decades and longer, this gradient exhibited interesting behavior (fig 2 - the timeseries is for the SST averaged over each box in figure 1, and then taking South minus North).  It shows 'oscillations' with periods of a few decades, on top of a trend over most of the 20th century.  This trend indicated that the tropical rainband over that region progressively shifted southwards over the 20th century.\n\nIn our recently published study [1], we investigated the causes of this trend.  Several years ago, several climate modeling groups simulated the climate of the 20th century, using the most accurate representations of the various climate forcings.  The simulations were collected the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3).  We analyzed these simulations, and found that the models systematically simulated a trend to the Atlantic Interhemispheric Gradient, in the same direction as the observed.  What was driving the trend- at least in the models - was the sulfate aerosols emitted by human activity.  In other words, anthropogenic sulfate aerosols were systematically altering the rainfall climate over the tropical Atlantic sector.\n\nMore recently, the modeling groups redid their simulations of the 20th century, but now with updated climate models as well as improved estimates climate forcing.  The simulations were collected and archived by the successor to CMIP3 - the CMIP5.  This new collection of model simulations provided an opportunity to test the conclusions of our previously published study - this was the motivation for our current investigation, funded by NSF.  \n\nIn a nutshell, we found from analysis of the CMIP5 simulations that the essential conclusions of our previous study held - that the trend in the Atlantic Interhemispheric SST gradient was partially driven by anthropogenic aerosol emissions.  A caveat with our current results was that we could not determine that it was anthropogenic sulfate aerosols, but rather that it was all anthropogenic aerosols taken together (so, not just sulfates, but also other aerosols like black carbon and organic carbon).  This limitation was due to the fact that the CMIP5 has not (yet) archived model simulations with sulfate aerosol changes only.  \n\nOur current investigation also produced an additional result. In our previous study, we inferred that the multidecadal variations (not the trend) to the Atlantic Interhemispheric SST gradient to come from a well-known multidecadal variation in the North Atlantic climate known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, or AMO.  The prevailing knowlege attribute the cause of the AMO to variations internal to the ocean-atmosphere climate system - so in other words, it occurrs naturally.  So, the climate models driven by 20th century climate forcings are not expected to simulate the AMO exactly as in observed.  \n\nRecently, however, a paper published by Booth and co-authors [2] showed that a model developed by the Hadley Center in the UK was able to simulate this AMO behavior when driven by 20th century climate forcings.  They showed that sulfate and volcanic aerosol changes were the main drivers of this behavior, and that a key physical process that made this possible was indirect effects of aerosols - the ability for aerosols to alter cloud properties that then changed Earth's radiative balance.  \n\nT..."
