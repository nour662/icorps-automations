 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continuing support for a program of research for the High Energy Physics group at Columbia University Nevis Labs. The program encompasses a broad spectrum of fundamental experiments in particle and astroparticle physics covering activities in five major ongoing programs: ATLAS; MiniBooNE/SciBooNE; MicroBooNE; and Double Chooz as well as R&D work on future projects including the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) and proton decay. Studies will be devoted to characterizing the Standard Model (SM) with increased precision and looking for new physics beyond the Standard Model since this most likely holds the key to making progress in our understanding of the universe. These will include searches for effects that herald supersymmetry, the Higgs boson, and possible extra space-time dimensions. The research program will also tackle the question of the nature of fundamental particles, such as top quarks (ATLAS) and neutrinos (MiniBooNE, MicroBooNE, Double Chooz), and, through precision measurements, probe higher energy scales. In addition, the Columbia group places a high priority on broader impacts, especially education and outreach, and plans to build on its very successful past efforts to integrate these activities into its ongoing research. The goal is to engage the full educational spectrum from high school students, high school teachers, undergraduates and the general public in understanding and doing high energy physics. The activities range from individual faculty outreach efforts, such as lectures, tours, and research involvement with high school students, to structured programs like the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). A primary emphasis of the Columbia programs is to target diversity and underrepresented groups",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA main part of the program is associated with physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, where Columbia scientists work in the ATLAS collaboration. The LHC is the world\u00c6s highest energy particle accelerator, and scientists use the collisions of very high-energy protons produced there to search for answers to fundamental questions about the universe, including the origin of particle masses, the nature of the so-called Dark Matter that accounts for most of the mass in the universe, the reason for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, and the possible existence of new particles and forces.  One of the main recent results was the discovery of the Higgs boson, which is one of the key building blocks of our understanding of how particles interact and the origin of particle masses.  This discovery resulted in the awarding of the 2013 Physics Nobel Prize.  Going beyond the discovery of the Higgs boson, the Columbia group is deeply involved with searches for new particles and phenomena.  Our current understanding of particle physics is believed to be only an approximate theory, and these new physics signatures will hold the key to making progress in understanding the ultimate, underlying theory.  As of yet, collider physicists including the Columbia group have only been able to rule out possible new signatures but the LHC opens a wide region with great discovery potential for these searches, especially as the LHC upgrades to higher energy and higher intensities.  Part of the Columbia program has been the development of upgrades for the ATLAS detector electronics for the higher intensities and the commissioning of the new innermost layer of the detector.  The LHC has been an unquestioned success and resource for making progress in understanding the universe and clearly will continue to be one of the most important scientific endeavors for the next several decades.\n\nAnother key part of the Columbia program is neutrino physics where the group is studying the phenomena of neutrino oscillations.  Neutrinos are one of the most elusive particles since they interact very weakly being the only matter particles that have no strong or electric charge.  There are three types of neutrinos associated with the three types of charged leptons including the well-known electron.  In the standard theory, neutrinos are massless but, as of 20 years ago, we know that they do have very small masses, which cause the neutrinos to change their type as they move, a phenomenon called neutrino oscillations.   The 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Takaaki Kajita (Univ. of Tokyo) and Arthur B. McDonald (Queen\u00c6s University) \"for the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass.\"\n\nBy studying the patterns of these neutrino oscillations, we are trying to answer several of the key questions in particle physics: Why is the neutrino mass so small?  Are there new types of \"sterile\" neutrinos?  Are neutrinos (normal or sterile) the reason for the matter to antimatter asymmetry in the universe?  The Columbia group has a major role in exploring all of these questions.\n\nSpecifically on the Double Chooz reactor antineutrino experiment in France, the Columbia group helped lead the publication of a number of oscillation measurements including the first measurement showing that the oscillation strength was large. The group is also actively involved in the MicroBooNE and MiniBooNE experiments at Fermilab that are searching for indications of a fourth type of sterile neutrino.  Establishing the existence of sterile neutrinos would be a major result for particle physics and is now a priority for the neutrino community.  The Columbia group has been a leader in the MiniBooNE analysis that showed significant anomalies that could be interpreted as sterile neutrino effects.  More recently, the group has been working on the MicroBooNE experiment, developing the detector readout and the data analy..."
