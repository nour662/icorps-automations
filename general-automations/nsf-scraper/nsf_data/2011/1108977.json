 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spiral patterns are one of the most important agents of dynamical evolution in disk galaxies. They redistribute angular momentum, cause the random speeds of stars to rise over time, cause radial mixing and large-scale turbulence, add stars to the thick disk, and flatten rotation curves. This project is a computational study of the effects of spiral patterns on disk evolution. The Prinicpal Investigator (PI) has several well-developed gravitational N-body codes that he will use with supported graduate students in two projects: (1) The Milky Way's thick disk is composed of old stars, in conflict with the \"spiral churning\" model for the formation of this component. The PI hypothesizes that the appearance of a bar in the inner Milky Way may have shut off thick disk growth by \"churning.\" He plans simulations to test this idea, comparing the evolution of similar disks in which bars are or are not formed. (2) It is still ambiguous how spiral galaxies manage the so-called \"disk-halo conspiracy,\" in which the different contributions of the disk and dark halo gravitational fields produce a flat observed rotation curve in the observable stars and gas. Simple models by the PI and collaborators showed that spiral waves could cause the mass distribution in a disk to rearrange itself until the rotation curve became flat; he plans further simulations including \"live\" halos to verify the generality of this behavior. Finally, the PI will continue work on recurring spiral patterns and their observable consequences in local stellar population. The PI plans careful N-body simulations of unprecedented quality for an in-depth study that will uncover the details of the recurrence mechanism in simplified models. Graduate students will assist with projects to show that the behavior persists when simplifying assumptions are relaxed. The PI will disseminate results of this work to the broader community through public lectures. He will involve undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs, in the research, providing them with experience and training in the research process.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe two most significant advances made under this award were a major breakthrough in the theory of spiral structure and the surprising discovery that stellar disks form bars much more readily when a rigid halo is replaced by a responsive one having the same density profile.\n\nThe origin of spiral patterns in galaxies is an old problem with no generally accepted solution.  Attempts by theorists to find unstable modes of smooth disks of stars that could create spiral oscillations have foundered, but the PI, with co-author Carlberg, discovered that non-smooth features in the disk could act as partial mirrors, allowing spiral standing waves to be set up.  While not quite the complete answer, their discovery represents a major step forward in a long-standing challenge.\n\nThe propensity for bar formation in models resembling disk galaxies is another old problem that was believed largely solved when a number of stability criteria were established about 40 years ago.  However, these stability criteria assumed that the dark matter halo affected only the central attraction acting on the disk stars and was otherwise unresponsive.  The PI has found that this assumption is incorrect, and that the halo provides a supporting response to the instability that forms a bar, causing bars to form in models that the previous criteria indicated should be stable.  This discovery has therefore renewed the challenge to account for the absence of bars in a sigificant minority of disk galaxies.\n\nOther work under this award has focused on the secular evolution of galaxy disks that is driven by spiral activity.  It was known from previous work by the PI using simplified 2D simulations that spiral activity is responsible for substantial radial diffusion stars away from their places of birth.  Here, a graduate student showed that this behavior is not significantly weakened in more realistic disk models having finite thickness, largely because the spatial scale of the spiral patterns is much greater than the thickness of the star layer.\n\nThe postdoc studied another aspect of secular evolution driven by spirals: the ironing out of density inhomogeneities in disks that might arise as the disk is assembled.  All our attempts to create disks having density profiles that had other than a smooth, near exponential decrease with radius were frustrated by vigorous spiral activity.  We were able to show that density ridges in the disk provoked the spiral instabilities that led to their dispersal.  Thus the smooth disks, and consequent smooth rotation curves, of galaxies today could well have been created by internal evolution and do not therefore require fine tuning of the galaxy formation process.\n\nThese are just four highlights from the research supported by this award, which in all resulted in 15 papers published in refereed journals, 5 conference papers, 7 posters, 4 web postings, and 2 major review papers.  Results were also presented at a number of international conferences and in seven lectures to public audiences in NJ.\n\nAs part of this work, the PI provided research experience and training in a STEM field, to two Rutgers undergraduates, an REU student from UVa, two Rutgers graduate students and one from Shanghai University, and a postdoc.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/04/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jerry A Sellwood"
