 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Javier Read de Alaniz of the University of California-Santa Barbara.  Professor Read de Alaniz will apply new strategies for the synthesis of functionalized five-membered rings.  The approach will rely on a domino rearrangement of 2-furylcarbinols, involving a formal 4-pi electrocyclization step, that provides efficient access to functionalized cyclopentenones, themselves important to medicine, biology, and material science.  First, an operationally simple synthetic methodology will be developed to construct functionalized five-membered rings, as well as nitrogen heterocycles in a single operation.  The intramolecular cascade rearrangement allows for the direct and highly diastereoselective synthesis of azaspirocyclic natural product cores. Second, the cascade rearrangement will be applied to the synthesis of quaternary stereogenic centers. In the final objective, efforts will be directed at achieving an enantioselective cascade rearrangement.\r\n\r\nProfessor Javier Read de Alaniz will also work with outreach programs at the University of California Santa Barbara to help overcome the lack of minority representation in the sciences.  Professor Read de Alaniz will serve as the faculty advisor for the University of California Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees (UC LEADS) program.  Working with the UC LEADS program Professor Read de Alaniz will participate in and lead a series of professional development workshop for promising underrepresented minority undergraduate students during the summer. The second educational initiative will provide students with the opportunity to interact with postdoctoral research associates and faculty from underrepresented minority/female backgrounds in an organized, yet casual, brown-bag lunch forum.  Faculty/post-doctoral research associates will discuss their career pathes along with topics of isolation and language barriers, increasing diversity on the campus, labeling, peer misperceptions, and mentoring.",

One such raw material, furfural, is produced from hemicellulose derived from agricultural waste products like bagasse, oat hulls and corncobs. Our group has made significant contributions to sustainable reaction development using furfural, for the synthesis of privileged chemical building blocks. Prior to our contributions, the acid catalyzed rearrangement of furylcarbinols, commonly known as the Piancatelli reaction, was limited to stoichiometric acid catalysts, elevated temperatures (100 &deg;C) and water as the nucleophile. Utilizing an underexplored Lewis acid, dysprosium triflate (Dy(OTf)<sub>3</sub>), we discovered and demonstrated that the nucleophilic partner can be extended to amines and alcohols. This new approach, termed the aza- and oxa-Piancatelli, provides a powerful method to streamline the synthesis of biologically active and medicinal compounds. The reaction constructs a carbon&ndash;carbon bond plus a carbon&ndash;heteroatom (nitrogen or oxygen) bond and two stereocenters in a single operation. To highlight the synthetic utility of our methodology, the reaction was used to prepare an hNK1 inhibitor<strong> </strong>in just six steps from furfural, previously the synthesis required greater than 15 synthetic operations.</p>\n<p>To further extend the synthetic utility of the cascade rearrangement, we have also developed the first intramolecular variant that provides rapid access to aza- and oxa-spirocyclic structural motifs, which are embedded in numerous remarkable natural products. The most practical, but also the most difficult and rare approach to construct this challenging spirocyclic framework would be to combine the construction of the tertiary stereocenter and the formation of the spirocyclic ring system in a single operation. This is now possible using our intramolecular aza- and oxa-Piancatelli rearrangements. In summary, by replacing multistep chemical synthesis with novel cascade rearrangements of furfural derivatives we have been able to provide chemists with a new approach to bioactive molecules that does not rely on petrochemical feedstock (Figure 1). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>In addition to what we perceive as the useful science that has emerged from this grant, broader impacts include our training of undergraduate researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as extensive outreach contributions to the local and national community.
