 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project focuses on the development of statistical methodology for 3-dimensional rotation data. As skeletal mammals move, their bones rotate around various joints, making data in the form of 3-dimensional rotations common in the study of biomechanics and human motion. While the investigator's previous work has made advances in modeling 3-dimensional orientations, there are many types of statistical inference that have not yet been studied for rotation data. This project models data from the study of human motion by developing (1) a nonsymmetric class of distributions, (2) a median estimator, (3) nonparametric methods, and (4) clustering methods for 3-dimensional rotations. The new statistical inference techniques produced provide answers to open questions in the study of biomechanics and human motion.\r\n \r\nAs the statistical inference methods for 3-dimensional rotation data developed through this research project are used in the study of human motion, they will lend solutions to scientific problems in physical therapy.  Thus, this project promotes interdisciplinary collaboration between the mathematics and physical therapy departments at a predominantly undergraduate university.  Additionally, this project includes the mentoring of undergraduate student research experiences, exposing students to interdisciplinary research collaboration at an early stage in their education.  While the statistical methodology developed by this project is used primarily to answer open questions in the study of human motion, it has the potential to impact other areas where 3-dimensional rotation data arise, such as vectorcardiography and materials science.",

These data are also common in the area of materials science, where orientations of crystals within metals are studied.  This project involved the development of nonparametric statistical techniques for exploring both the center and spread of 3-dimensional rotation data.  The developed bootstrapping procedures allowed for the estimation of center and spread, while the developed permutation tests allowed for comparing center and spread in two different 3-dimensional rotation data sets.  Applications were made in the area of biomechanics to compare movement around the calcaneocuboid joint in baboons, chimpanzees, and humans.  Applications were made in materials science to study the precision of crystal orientation data collected on metal specimens through the process of electron backscatter diffraction.  The research advanced the field of statistics by developing novel techniques for analyzing 3-dimensional rotation data.  The techniques developed are at a level that can be understood by practitioners that work in fields that collect 3-dimensional rotation data (e.g. physical therapy, materials science), so this research also aids study in those fields. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Melissa A Bingham"
