The annual Computational and Systems Neuroscience (Cosyne) conference promotes this process by providing an inclusive forum for the exchange of experimental and theoretical/computational approaches to problems in systems neuroscience.  This purpose of this project is to broaden participation of women and other under-represented groups at the Cosyne meeting.  Travel awards and a variety of outreach activities are planned for the 2012, 2013, and 2014 meetings.",
