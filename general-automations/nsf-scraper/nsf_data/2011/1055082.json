 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 45th Annual Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will be held at the University of Texas at Tyler from Thursday March 17 through Saturday March 19, 2011.  The conference will offer special sessions in Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Group Theory, Geometric Topology, and Set-theoretic Topology, as well as six plenary talks and 12 semi-plenary talks covering the breadth of the special sessions.  The conference is organized by the special session organizing committees, the conference steering committee, and the principal investigator on the grant.  The grant provides funds to support travel for graduate students and young researchers, in addition to the invited speakers.\r\n \r\nThe series of conferences is one of the longest running in mathematics.  In the spring of 1967, the first conference was held at Arizona State University, and it was primarily a conference on general topology and continuum theory.  In the past 45 years, the conference has grown in size and scope.  It has continued to be the most important conference of the year in set-theoretic topology and continuum theory, while expanding to include the areas of dynamical systems, geometric group theory, and geometric topology.  Over the years, the conference has made special efforts to broaden participation by women, underrepresented groups, graduate students, and young researchers, while expanding to cover a broader section of topology.  Many of the most famous results of the last 45 years have been first announced at this conference.\r\n\r\nConference website: http://www.math.uttyler.edu/sgraves/STDC2011/Welcome.html",

The conference was supported by NSF grant DMS 1055082.  There were 212 registered participants representing eighteen countries around the world.\n\nThis conference series has been among the longest running and most  successful conferences in mathematics.   Once again this year, the  leading topologists from around the world gathered to share the latest  results in the field and to encourage and train the next generation of  researchers by supporting the large number of graduate students who  attended the conference.\n\nStructural Overview:\n\nThe conference was organized by Conference Chair Sheldon Davis, Conference Secretary Lori Wages, both from University of Texas at Tyler, and by five special session organizing committees.  They were arranged by discipline as follows:\n\nContinuum Theory \n Gerardo Acosta (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico), chair\n Van Nall (University of Richmond) \n Thelma West (University of Louisiana, Lafayette)\n\nDynamical Systems \n John Mayer (University of Alabama at Birmingham), chair \n Daniel Look (St. Lawrence University) \n Brian Raines (Baylor University)\n\nGeometric Group Theory \n Noel Brady (University of Oklahoma), chair \n Ross Geoghegan (Binghamton University, SUNY)\n Kim Ruane (Tufts University) \n\nGeometric Topology \n Steve Ferry (Rutgers University), chair \n NIkolay Brodskiy (University of Tennessee) \n Gerard Venema (Calvin College) \n\nSet-theoretic Topology \n Alan Dow (University of North Carolina, Charlotte), chair \n Michael Hrusak (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico) \n Todd Eisworth (Ohio University) \n\nSix speakers were invited to give 50 minute plenary talks, twelve speakers were invited to give 35 minute semi-plenary talks, and each special session was allotted twenty-four spots in parallel sessions for contributed talks of twenty minutes duration.  The invited speakers were divided roughly equally among the special session areas with special interest in speakers who would appeal to more than one discipline.  There was a bit of overflow in the contributed talk sessions, and that was accommodated by running a sixth session at times.  The conference schedule and abstracts booklet is attached.
