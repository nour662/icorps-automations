 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will perform of a series of systematic comparisons between the results of global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and hybrid simulations of Earth's magnetosheath and magnetopause.  The hybrid simulations will treat the electrons as a fluid but will treat the ions as kinetic particles.  The simulations will be compared with each other as well as with observations from the THEMIS and Cluster spacecraft missions. Results of these comparative studies will make it possible to determine where, how, and to which extent local kinetic processes occurring in the magnetosheath and at its boundaries alter the MHD predictions of its large-scale properties and dynamics. The research will considerably improve the understanding of the effects of local processes on the large-scale transport of mass, energy, and momentum from the solar wind to the magnetosphere and will ascertain the solar wind plasma regimes and IMF orientations for which global MHD simulations can be used reliably.\r\n\r\nGlobal MHD simulations have been the standard approach to modeling how the solar wind interacts with Earth?s magnetosphere. Such modeling is crucial to predicting space weather effects such as magnetic storms.  Spacecraft observations, however, have revealed a number of effects in that interaction that cannot be described by MHD simulations. This project will improve our understanding of when and under what conditions MHD simulations can be relied on for space weather forecasting. The project will also include an educational component by involving a graduate student who will participate in every aspect of the research.",

The societal impacts of space weather have grown in time so that most of today&rsquo;s technologies are directly affected by the conditions in the magnetosphere. As a result, understanding the physical processes that control the dynamics and response of the magnetosphere to solar wind conditions is essential. Because the solar wind flow speed is supersonic, its interaction with the magnetosphere results in the formation of a bow shock which slows it down and diverts it around the outer boundary of the magnetosphere named the magnetopause. As in ordinary shock waves, this flow deceleration is associated with the heating of the plasma downstream of the bow shock which is called the magnetosheath. In contrast to ordinary shocks, however, particle collisions do not occur at the bow shock and the required plasma heating is accomplished through the excitation of electromagnetic ULF waves with wavelengths comparable to the radius of the Earth. The objective of this study was to understand how the properties of the magnetosheath deviate from those if the bow shock were collisional and the generation of ULF waves was not needed. To achieve this objective, we utilized two types of global electromagnetic simulations (1) Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and (2) Kinetic ions (Hybrid) simulations. The MHD simulations are based on the assumption of collisions being present while Hybrid simulations are collisionless and account for the generation of ULF waves (kinetic effects). We use the attached figure to summarize the results of our investigation. It shows the plasma density (normalized to solar wind density) from both simulations in the noon-midnight meridian plane with X along the solar wind velocity and Z along the Earth&rsquo;s dipole axis. In the MHD model, the solar wind upstream of the bow shock remains pristine with the jump in density occurring at the bow shock. In addition, the bow shock and the magnetosheath achieve steady state conditions. In contrast, the solar wind in the hybrid model is modified by the presence of ULF waves in a region upstream of the bow shock called the ion foreshock. These ULF waves are carried by the solar wind back into the bow shock resulting in a highly turbulent magnetosheath including large regions of low density (and magnetic field) called magnetosheath cavity. It is evident from this figure that ion kinetic effects have major impacts on the properties of the magnetosheath. Our investigations also demonstrate that the presence of magnetosheath cavities and smaller scale pressure variations in the magnetosheath lead to expansion (sunward motion of the magnetopause) and contraction (anti-sunward motion of the magnetopause) of the magnetosphere which in turn could result in the excitation of waves in the magnetosphere and precipitation of particles into the ionosphere. Thus, kinetic effects associated with particle heating by the bow shock are found to have significant impacts on the magnetospheric dynamics and space weather phenomena. The results of this study are not only relevant to the Earth&rsquo;s bow shock but all collisionless shocks which occur throughout the solar system (e.g. planetary bow shocks) and also astrophysical settings such as supernova shock waves.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/23/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jean&nbsp;Berchem</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1103264/1103264_10093797_1479942759064_MHD_HYBRID_COMPARISON--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1103264/1103264_10093797_1479942759064_MHD_HYBRID_COMPARISON--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MHD - Ion Kinetic (Hybrid) Model Comparison\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1103264/1103264_10093797_1479942759064_MHD_HYBRID_COMPARISON--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MHD - Ion Kinetic (Hybrid) Model Comparison\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparison between the results of MHD and Hybrid simulations of the interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetosphere: Plasma density in the noon-midnight meridian plane</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">N.
