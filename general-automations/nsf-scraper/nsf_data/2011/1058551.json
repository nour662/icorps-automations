 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need for\r\nrenewably powered and always available energy for powering personal medical and other\r\nlocation aware sensors. The project advances wearable thermoelectric generator (WTEG)\r\ntechnology. The system will yield new advances in terms of miniaturization, increases in\r\nWTEG power densities, application of advanced heat transfer materials, and integration with\r\ncutting edge locator system electronics. The research focuses on matching the thermal\r\nresistance of the thermoelectric generator with the thermal resistance of the skin to air interface,\r\naccomplished through the optimization of thermocouple geometries implemented in thin film\r\nsemiconductors applied to a flexible polyimide substrate. The anticipated result of the research\r\nwill be a fully functional wristband locator system that is lightweight, adjustable, waterproof, and\r\nrenewably powered from the human body.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes applications for location\r\ntracking of Alzheimer?s patients, nursing home patients, and elderly home healthcare. As our\r\npopulation ages, achieving a balance between personal independence while providing for\r\nprimary healthcare monitoring will be critical. Wearable thermoelectric generator technology\r\ncan be used to power wireless sensors that monitor patient location and help facilities track ?at\r\nrisk? residents. Additionally, wireless sensors can help healthcare providers improve treatment,\r\nincrease efficiency, and cut costs. A wide range of other follow-on medical applications include\r\nglucose monitoring for diabetic treatment and care, diagnosing sleep disorders, and the\r\nphysiological monitoring of first responders, law enforcement, and soldiers. Each of these\r\napplications has been limited by finite and limited battery life. Harvesting body heat and\r\nconverting to usable electrical energy opens up a new era of autonomous wearable devices.",
