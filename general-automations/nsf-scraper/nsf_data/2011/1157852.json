 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pump proposed in this I-Corps effort addresses critical unmet needs by providing a miniaturized mouse-compatible form factor, wireless power and remote control features, and fully-customizable dosing capability for chronic drug administration studies. The team addresses the immediate need from academia and industry for pumps in both laboratory animal research for scientific discovery and preclinical drug studies. Applying the pump technology at the earliest stage of preclinical validation may improve the development of new drugs and enable new treatment paradigms. The scalability of the technology also has the potential to extends the addressable market beyond laboratory animal research to human patient care,  The long-term goal is to leverage this technology in combination with novel therapeutics that cannot be delivered by other means to provide patient-specific dosing profiles in humans in a manner that maximizes therapeutic benefit while minimizing side effects. This I-Corps effort will result in a plan to transition the proposed innovation to the marketplace, fabrication of prototypes, and technology demonstration.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to transition innovative technology, a miniature implantable infusion pump, for drug development and treatment. The pump specifically addresses limitations of current technologies and offers accurate and customizable dosing in a compact form factor. The technology incorporates next generation capability through the integration of wireless communication and information technology. These advanced delivery systems and novel therapeutics present a fertile opportunity for advancing not only research but technology commercialization and health care outcomes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the first class of the NSF I-Corps program, the team sought to translate proprietary miniature implantable infusion pump technology developed in the lab to a range of non-clinical and clinical markets.  The team consisted of a faculty co-inventor (as the principal investigator), student entrepreneurial lead and inventor, a faculty entrepreneur/co-inventor, and an industry mentor.  Through I-Corps training, the team conducted customery discovery interviews and determined actual market needs.  An important outcome of this process was that the team identified a single target market and subsequently formulated realistic strategies to enable the transition of the technology to market.  These valuable first steps were essential in ensuring a viable market and determining a minimum viable first product before further fundraising to further product development.  The entrepreneurial training provided by the I-Corps program has enabled the team to move their technology beyond the lab and prepare for the NSF Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.\n\n \n\nThe intellectual merit of the overall outcome is that a minimum viable product was identified.  This outcome was essential to the team's continued ability to transition their technology to market.  Another important outcome is the team's recognition of the need to continually assess and re-assess customer and market needs.  These discovery activities lead to identification of potential partners.  The lessons learned in the I-Corps project also directly impacted the team's ability to successfully compete for and win an SBIR award.\n\n \n\nThe broader impacts of the outcome are the entrepreneurial training of the diverse team (including females and one Hispanic member), involvement and training of student interns in the realization of the minimum viable product, and transfer of learned concepts by the team to other faculty and students interested in similar technology transition pathways for their research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/02/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ellis F Meng"
