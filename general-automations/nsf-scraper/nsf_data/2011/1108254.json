  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTimothy Logan\n\nEAPSI-China Project Outcomes Report\n\nThe EAPSI fellowship has offered me a unique experience to conduct valuable research in my field of expertise as well as explore the culture and customs of a country that is different than my own.  My research focuses on Asian aerosol and their transport and it was fortuitous to have the opportunity to study in China for nearly two months to gain a better understanding of how aerosols behave in their source region.  In addition, I was also granted the unique opportunity to be immersed in a culture that is different than my own.\n\nThrough the help of my host and his team of students, I was able to conduct valuable research and experience China through their eyes.  I shared some of my current results with the graduate students and received good constructive criticism for my methodology.  They asked many questions about how I arrived at my conclusions and were interested in how they could incorporate my techniques into their research.  I also aided in reviewing several of their manuscripts which were subsequently accepted for publication.  \n\nWe shared similar work and social ethics in that we all work long hours for research, however they allot time for afternoon naps which I found interesting since that is usually frowned upon in the United States.  The Chinese graduate students do spend time as a group outside of class by having dinner, singing \"KTV\", and going to movies.  I was taken to several places in Wuhan that were educational (Wuhan Botanical Garden and Hubei Provincial Museum) and recreational (trip to Three Gorges Dam).  My host also made it possible for me to attend and present at an aerosol conference in Nanjing where I was able to collaborate with professors and students from other Chinese universities which widened my network of colleagues.\n\nThe summer in China was full of many adventures, surprises, and opportunities for growth.  I was able to conduct good research with eager and willing students as well as briefly assume their lifestyle for which I am grateful.  I look forward to returning to China to either give a presentation or even work as a post-doc/visiting scientist.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy Logan"
