 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is the most powerful tool that chemists have at their disposal for the characterization and identification of chemical compounds. As such, hands-on access to a modern NMR spectrometer is regarded as a crucial component of the training and education of future chemists, biochemists, and students of other STEM disciplines. This project at Stetson University is transforming the way in which undergraduate students approach problems in chemistry and biochemistry by integrating the application of standard NMR techniques (proton and carbon-13 NMR) in a holistic fashion throughout the entire curriculum, beginning in first-year general chemistry classes and progressing through each of the five \"foundations\" areas (Organic, Inorganic, Physical, Analytical, and Biochemistry). Additionally, this project is developing a cohesive series of new phosphorus-31 NMR laboratory experiments and exercises that span all of these same chemical disciplines, allowing students to acquire a more authentic understanding of an important chemical technique while gaining insight into the use of a single tool for solving problems across the chemical sciences. By providing students with rewarding and student-centered experiences with modern chemical techniques, this project is helping to recruit and retain outstanding students into STEM programs at Stetson University and prepare them for success in STEM fields. Moreover, through the widespread dissemination of the newly developed pedagogical resources to the chemical education community, this project is contributing to improving the overall quality of STEM education.",
