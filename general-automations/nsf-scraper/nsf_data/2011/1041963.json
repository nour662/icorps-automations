 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a 3-year project to undertake experimental and theoretical studies of Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) dynamics and their implications for turbulence and mixing in the Earth atmosphere. KHI is known to occur throughout the lower atmosphere as well as the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) and to contribute significantly to the dynamics.  In addition, KHI evolution affects VHF Doppler radar wind measurement errors by producing strong, persistent layering and a systematic tilting of refractive index surfaces on scales comparable to VHF radar Bragg scales.   This project addresses both of these aspects.  Observations will be performed at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO) in Peru, which provides an exceptional combination of sensitivity and resolution throughout the lower atmosphere and the MLT. High range resolution and sensitivity at mid-tropospheric heights provided by the SOUSY Radar (at JRO), coupled with concurrent, quantitative, high-resolution, in situ measurements made using a newly developed unmanned aerial system, named the micro-autonomous vehicle (MAV), will provide an unsurpassed assessment of both high resolution KHI dynamics and radar measurement errors. The relatively high-resolution and higher-power capability provided by the powerful JRO transmitter and large antenna array will then extend the SOUSY results into the MLT. Finally, these observations will be used to initialize a series of numerical assessments of KHI radar backscatter and associated dynamical parameters using a new capability to perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) to characterize, and guide corrections of, measurement errors accompanying these dynamics for general flow conditions.\r\n\r\nThe inaccuracies in radar wind measurements from KHI is a limiting factor in understanding atmospheric dynamics on essentially all scales of motion, including: mean motions, wind shears, large-scale tidal and planetary wave activity, smaller-scale gravity wave dynamics, and small-scale instabilities and turbulence-generating processes. The results from this project, therefore, will improve practically all applications of VHF radar observations to great benefit of the scientific community as well as weather and climate modeling applications.  The project also will result in improved quantitative understanding of interactions between waves and instability dynamics that drive motions throughout the atmosphere and at all scales. This will lead to better parameterization of small-scale dynamics in weather and climate models.",

Three were carried out in Peru in close proximity to the Sousy radar. Two campaigns have been carried out in Japan where the DataHawk was flown in close proximity to the Shigaraki MU radar. Two campaigns have been carried out at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. One of these was conducted in cooperation with the MATERHORN campaign.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DataHawk measurements can be obtained at relatively low cost, compared to other UAS-based systems, since the vehicle is small, lightweight, and low-cost itself. This enables several vehicles to be procured for a campaign, so that loss or damage is easily accommodated by spares. This also enables measurements to be obtained in highly dynamic atmospheric conditions that are often of high scientific interest, since the cost of attrition is small. The DataHawk can reach altitudes of 4km from a ground launch, fly in circles as small as 100m diameter, and can ascend/descend at very low rates for sub-meter vertical measurement resolution, making it highly useful for study of the atmospheric boundary layer in virtually any location. &nbsp;It has a low kinetic energy and soft foam construction that promotes safety, although local air traffic control permission is needed for assuring deconfliction with other aircraft. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The upgraded DataHawk 2 design provides a more rugged airframe that can sustain many more hard landings in rough terrain, improving availability and reducing repair costs. This also enables the aircraft to be broken down for shipment in a very compact 24in by 12in by 3in volume. In turn, this enables an entire DataHawk \"flock\" of 5 vehicles to be shipped in a single 27in by 16in by 34in crate, including ground support equipment. The airframe upgrade also provides gust-insensitivity and its higher airspeed enables its use in more dynamic atmospheric conditions.</p>\n<p>DataHawks have been dropped from small weather balloons as high as 9km above ground. Even though the balloon drifts downwind a significant distance at this altitude, the DataHawk can return upwind to descend on helical paths at a desired GPS location, in this case to the vicinity of a vertical radar beam. &nbsp;This enables coincident measurements with the radar in the same volumes of air, providing the first such measurements and comparisons between remote and in-situ data that can be directly compared, unlike radiosonde measurements that drift too far away from the radar for meaningful data comparisons.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Excellent correspondence between radar returns and in-situ DataHawk measurements were obtained, allowing a direct calibration of radar sensitivity to atmospheric turbulence for the first time. &nbsp;Also, the ability of radar to provide a coarse profile of the atmosphere in near real time enables operators to send a DataHawk vehicle to obtain fine-scale samples at particular areas of interest. This technique is very powerful, and can be expected to enable many dynamical features to be investigated more thoroughly that ever before.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/23/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dale&nbsp;A&nbsp;Lawrence</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482514314671_DH2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482514314671_DH2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"DataHawk\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482514314671_DH2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"DataHawk\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The DataHawk unmanned aerial vehicle was developed at the University of Colorado for fine-scale atmospheric sensing.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dale Lawrence</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dale&nbsp;A&nbsp;Lawrence</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">DataHawk</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482514532030_JRO_2014_balloon_drop--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482514532030_JRO_2014_balloon_drop--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"JRO Balloon Drop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482514532030_JRO_2014_balloon_drop--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"JRO Balloon Drop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Preparing to loft a DataHawk wtih a weather balloon at the Jicarmarca Radio Observatory in Peru,  to achieve high altitude sampling over the Sousy radar.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dale Lawrence</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dale&nbsp;A&nbsp;Lawrence</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">JRO Balloon Drop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482514927843_Dugway--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482514927843_Dugway--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dugway\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482514927843_Dugway--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dugway\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ground operations during a DataHawk campaign at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, where semi-autonomous flight control enables loose supervision by operators.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ben Balsley</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dale&nbsp;A&nbsp;Lawrence</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dugway</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482515142816_Shigaraki--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482515142816_Shigaraki--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Shiraraki\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482515142816_Shigaraki--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Shiraraki\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ground control operations for a DataHawk campaign near the MU radar in Shigaraki, Japan, operating from a small clearing in dense forest.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dale Lawrence</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dale&nbsp;A&nbsp;Lawrence</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Shiraraki</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482515552953_trajectory-UAV5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482515552953_trajectory-UAV5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SUREX 2015 trajectory\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041963/1041963_10132425_1482515552953_trajectory-UAV5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SUREX 2015 trajectory\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Superimposed radar returns (gray scale image) versus altitude profile (red) and radar range (green) of the DataHawk during flight 5 near the MU radar in Shigaraki, Japan in 2015.
