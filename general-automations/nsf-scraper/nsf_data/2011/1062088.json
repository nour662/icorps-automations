 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds meetings by a group of economists and political scientists who are conducting research on important questions in African political economy.  The goal of the group is to understand the core issues in the political economy of African development, including ethnic politics, civil conflict and violence, decentralization, democratization, corruption, and local governance.  Scholars attending these meetings share new findings, develop new collaborations, and advance research in the field.  \r\n\r\nThe meetings are attended by established scholars, new faculty, and advanced graduate students.  Attendees include scholars with deep field research experience in Africa and scholars who are developing cutting edge research tools in political economy methods.   Graduate students attending the meetings build their professional networks and receive constructive feedback from leading scholars in a collaborative setting.  Workshop members present their results to policymakers and research in dozens of African countries, at the World Bank, at scientific conferences, and through books, essays, and articles aimed at a general audience.",
