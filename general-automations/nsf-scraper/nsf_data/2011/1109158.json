 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support is an observational study of chromospheric activity in young solar-type stars.  Dr. Gray and his students will conduct long-term spectroscopic monitoring of the chromospheric fluxes in the cores of the Ca II H & K lines, coupled with simultaneous and high-cadence multi-band photometric observations of these stars.  The principal goals are to explore the timing and size of starspot cycles, discover correlations between activity levels and stellar brightness, uncover the presence and character of short-term behavior such as flare activity, and investigate the influence of Jupiter-mass planets on stellar activity levels.\r\n\r\nThe project will to provide hands-on research opportunities at an institution whose students are mainly from a rural population in an under-served region of the United States.  The research will may also help improve our understanding of the Sun-earth environment at a time 3-4 billion years ago when life was gaining a foothold on our planet, and aid in the assessment of the possibility of life in other planetary systems around sun-like stars.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Young Solar Analogs Project studies a set of 30 young solar-type stars with the goal of learning more about the challenges a young sun presented to the origin and development of life on Earth, and by extension, other suitable habitats in our solar system and beyond.  We concentrate on stars with ages between 300 million years and 1.5 billion years -- coinciding closely with the epoch for which we have the earliest evidence for life on Earth.  The young sun presented multiple challenges to that early life -- enhanced X-ray and ultraviolet radiation, brightness variability (up to 15%, compared to the present 0.1%) and higher flare frequency and energy compared to the present sun. \n\nOur project continues the long tradition -- started in the 1960's at Mount Wilson Observatory -- of using the strong lines of ionized calcium in stellar spectra to monitor stellar activity (sunspot cycles, flares, etc.), but we have supplemented that with photometric (brightness) observations of our program stars.  For that purpose we constructed an entirely robotic observatory that observes our stars photometrically every clear night.  In addition, we have investigated the use of other strong features in the stellar spectrum -- in particular the G-band -- to study stellar activity.  We are particularly interested in the solar and stellar output in the ultraviolet UV-C band, now completely blocked from the ground by the ozone layer.  However, when life first formed on the Earth, the atmosphere was oxygen-poor and there was no ozone layer.  Thus that biologically damaging radiation could penetrate all the way to the surface of the Earth, and this has important implications for the habitability of the Earth's surface during that early epoch.  Observing our program stars in the UV-C would require regular observations with space telescopes, but our studies indicate that the G-band observations may serve as useful optical-region proxies for the UV-C, as we have found that the G-band strength is modified by the presence of stellar-activity-related continuum emission.  What this means is that by measuring the strength of the G-band in our program stars, we may infer the stellar output in the UV-C.   The G-band may also be useful for studying the energetics of powerful flares, as we have observed the G-band to weaken during flares.\n\nOur monitoring efforts over the years have shown that some of our young solar-type stars appear to vary with regular sunspot cycles like the sun.  Others show more chaotic behavior, or may even show novel types of cycling behavior.  A longer monitoring period is required for definitive answers.  On a shorter timescale, we have detected rotational periods for many of our stars, as both the activity level and the brightness of the star vary as large sunspot groups rotate onto and off of the visible hemisphere.  Interestingly the correlation between activity and stellar brightness in our young program stars is opposite to that seen in the sun.  The photometric variability that we have observed on timescales of days to years also has important implications for the climate of the early Earth.\n\nMany of our stars show differential rotation, in the sense that, as in the sun, their equatorial region rotates more quickly than the polar regions.  We have detected a number of flares in our stars both photometrically and spectroscopically, including one \"superflare\".  High-cadence spectroscopic observations, made possible by the new spectrograph on the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (Mt. Graham, Arizona) have revealed that most of our program stars \"flicker\" in the ionized calcium lines on a timescale of minutes.  The origin of this flickering is not known, but it may give us a new window into the physics of stellar activity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/16/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard O Gray"
