 "awd_abstract_narration": "****Technical Abstract****\r\n\r\nThe electronic scattering, localization, and fluctuation associated with a point defect ultimately limit what is practically achievable in electronics.  This NSF project uses new advances in materials and techniques to systematically measure the transport phenomena associated with single point defects in one-dimensional, carbon nanotube conductors.  The one-dimensional limit dramatically amplifies the importance of single defects, to the extent that a single bond or atom modification can substantially affect two- or three-terminal device characteristics.  This project will perform a comparative study of different types of defects, produced through deterministic chemical modification, in order to identify reproducible electronic features that can be associated with specific chemical terminations.  Variable temperature conductance spectroscopy, scanning probe techniques, and noise spectroscopy will all be used to characterize devices before and after the incorporation of single point defects.  The project will support the education of a Ph.D. student and also provide summer research opportunities for undergraduates and talented high school students.  Because the field of research lies at the crossroads between traditional physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering, these research opportunities provide outstanding starting points for careers in science and technology.\r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\n\r\nThe copper wires that conduct most electricity are not very sensitive to a missing or misplaced atom.  But imagine what happens when these wires shrink to nanometer scales.  As the wire diameter approaches a few atoms, one missing atom could have enormous effects.  New advances in materials and scientific tools allow us to actually make and study wires at this scale, along with more complicated electronic devices like transistors.  For practical reasons, future electronics are more likely to use carbon wires than copper ones, so this project uses hollow carbon \"nanotubes,\" wires having a cross section of only ten to twenty atoms.  By fashioning these wires into transistors and then modifying carbon bonds one by one, the project will map out and understand the electronic consequences of disorder in atomic scale devices.  This work  is a \"bottom-up\" approach to understanding practical electronics at the smallest scales, and it will inform and enable the success of future electronics as traditional, \"top-down\" manufacturing shrinks to ever smaller scales.  The project will support the education of a Ph.D. student and also provide summer research opportunities for undergraduates and talented high school students.  Because the field of research lies at the crossroads between traditional physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering, these research opportunities provide outstanding starting points for careers in science and technology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIndustry\u00c6s ability to design and build electronic circuits at ever smaller scales is limited by control over point defects and our understanding of their electronic consequences. Roadmaps for future advances in electronics depend on the successful implementation of low-dimensional devices and an improved understanding of defect properties has become an identified need.  For example, the current international roadmap for development in the semiconductor industry (ITRS) specifically calls for the development of new techniques that can investigate defect scattering and develop practical strategies for minimizing defect consequences. \n\nThis NSF project supported the development of new techniques for probing individual defects in nanometer-scale electronics.  The project primarily focused on scanning probe techniques that could precisely measuring the effects of point defects in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs).  SWNTs are extremely narrow electrical conductors that confine electrical currents to one dimension.  The one dimensional limit greatly enhances the electronic effects of point defects, leading to substantial effects in practical devices like transistors and room temperature circuits.  This limit is the realm where experimental physics has the fewest tools and the semiconductor industry has requested the most guidance.\n\nTo address these goals, this project measured the consequences of single atomic defects on electronic properties.  To achieve this, the project had to first develop a suite of experimental techniques for studying a defect's effects.  The measurements distinguished resonant and non-resonant scattering by defects, and long-range electrostatic interactions of defects in quasi-one-dimensional conductors.  These experimental findings will begin to help guide the broader scientific effort of designing electronics at the nanometer and molecular scales.\n\nThis project resulted in 10 peer-reviewed articles published in scientific journals, plus invited reviews and a book chapter.  The work was also described in numerous conferences and conference proceedings.\n\nIn addition to the research activities, mentoring and outreach were integral components of this research program.  The project supported the training of 1 postdoctoral researcher, 4 graduate students, 6 undergraduate students, and 1 high school student in the preparation and electronic characterization of nanomaterials.  Undergraduate and graduate students worked together in a collaborative, team environment.  Undergraduates were provided with genuine research responsibilities, and graduate students gained a broad base of experience that extended beyond one particular discipline or specialization.\n\nIn addition to training in the laboratory, the project included a variety of educational outreach efforts on campus and off.  The PI represented nanoscience research to over one hundred students each year at the annual Irvine Unified School District Career Fairs.  Graduate students supported by this project also played a role in educational outreach.  Our largest effort, named Laboratory Experiments &amp; Activities in the Physical Sciences (LEAPS), specifically targeted Orange County schools serving disadvantaged minorities.  Four LEAPS days in 2012-2014 brought over 200 middle school students through our laboratories for discussion and hands-on demonstrations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/12/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip G Collins"
