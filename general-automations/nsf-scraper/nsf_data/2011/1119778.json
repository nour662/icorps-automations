 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis and the defining organelle of green plants. They have the essential role of reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is ultimately the source of food and feed stocks. They are also involved in the synthesis of many nutrients and specialized chemicals useful to humans, as well as playing a role in sensing changes in the environment. Most of the functions of chloroplasts (and other plastids) are carried out by proteins encoded in the nucleus, the products of the Plastid-targeted Nuclear Genes (PNGs). This project, through an integration of computational and experimental approaches, will provide a mechanistic understanding of how PNGs are regulated transcriptionally in the model plant Arabidopsis, identify what the putative roles of the PNGs are, and define how various chloroplast functions are connected. Functions of PNGs implicated in amino acid metabolic networks will be experimentally verified. These studies will lead to a better understanding of plastid biology and will also broadly inform systems approaches to biology.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: In addition to enhancing our understanding of regulatory and metabolic networks in plastid function, this project will continue to make use of and disseminate the findings through a publicly available phenotype database (www.plastid.msu.edu ) that is of value to the scientific community in many contexts, including research and development for genetically-engineered crop plants. In addition to providing interdisciplinary training to postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, the project will integrate research and education as part of a successful summer internship program (www.plantgenomics.msu.edu). Junior and senior undergraduate students will work in participating laboratories each summer performing research related to the project. This program will have a strong emphasis on the recruitment and training of underrepresented minorities and women.",

Instead, when faced with environmental stress, proper responses need to be elicited in a timely and specific manner otherwise the plant will not survive. Among the many features that allow plants to respond to stressful environments, genes involved in metabolism are of particular interest. This is because plant metabolism is central for the synthesis of nutrients and precursors for chemicals that are important for plant survival and also for human use. In addition, plant metabolism is highly sensitive to the environment. Thus it is important to understand how metabolism is regulated and contributes to plant survival under stressful environments. This project has two major goals. The first is to identify new genes involved in plant metabolic processes. Although in the past century biochemical and genetic studies have provided a wealth of information about plant metabolism, we still do not know how many plant chemicals are made and the genes for many metabolic enzymes making these chemicals remain to be identified.

To accomplish this objective, we first focused on improving a commonly used approach called \"guilt-by-association\". Consider two genes, where one has no known function and the other is known to play a role in self defense against insects. If these two genes have significantly similar properties, then we hypothesize that the gene with no known function may a play role in defense as well. In this project, we collected a large number of experiments measuring how much gene product was made and used these measurements to determine how similar two genes are. We found genes that play roles in different metabolic pathways have very distinct degrees of similarity. In addition, we demonstrated the influence of which experimental data is used, how data is processed, what measure is used to determine similarity, and how genes are grouped together in identifying the genes play roles in different metabolic pathways.

To cope with stress, plants respond by changing the amount of gene products made. As a result, depending on the specific stress, hundreds to thousands of genes are influenced. These changes in gene product abundance are controlled, in large part, by short DNA sequences that behave like molecular switches to turn genes on or off in various situations. Through this project, we identified hundreds to thousands of these molecular switches that are important for turning genes on when plants are subjected to salt water, low/high temperature, UV-light, and pathogens.
