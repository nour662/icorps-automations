 "awd_abstract_narration": "Great earthquakes occur at the boundaries of the world's tectonic plates where an increasing fraction of the population is exposed to high seismic risk. This project develops and uses large-scale computer simulations to investigate fault system interactions that control the occurrence and characteristics of earthquakes occurring along plate boundary fault systems. The project will develop computer models of the North American plate boundary, which consists of the subduction zone of Southern British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Northern California; and the San Andreas fault system of Northern and Southern California. This research addresses the short-term (minutes to years) predictibilty of earthquakes, and long-term processes  (100-1000 years) that condition fault systems to fail in great earthquakes. To better characterize the magnitude and variability of ground shaking in damaging earthquakes, which is needed for increasing our resilience to earthquake disasters, the fault system models will be integrated with advanced ground motion simulations.\r\n\r\nThe highly concentrated deformation of the brittle crust at plate boundaries largely occurs through the integrated slip of faults in geometrically complex fractal-like fault systems. Fault slip phenomena, including earthquakes, continuous fault creep, slow slip events, earthquake afterslip, and earthquake repeaters, with their exceptionally wide range of temporal and spatial scales, are products of the rich array of interactions that operate in these systems. The simulations of plate boundary fault systems developed by this project will span >10,000yrs of plate motion and consist of up to106 discrete events. Simulations on this scale are now possible due to advances in our understanding of fault constitutive properties and the interactions that give rise to the different modes of fault slip; growth of knowledge to define the 3D geometry of plate boundary fault systems; and development of numerical methods that permit highly efficient simulations across a very wide range of spatial and temporal scales. System-level simulations provide an experimental capability to probe these very complex systems to better understand the interactions that give rise to observable effects, and to advance predictive capabilities. In addition, simulations provide the means to integrate a wide range of observations from seismology, tectonic geodesy, and earthquake geology into a common framework.  Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), the main tool used by earthquake scientists and engineers to ensure seismic safety in the built environment, requires long-term forecasting of ground motions of all potentially damaging earthquakes. This research will integrate the fault system models with advanced fault rupture and ground motion simulations to investigate the statistical nature of strong ground motions needed for reliable PSHA.",

Figure 1 shows the California fault system model. A unique aspect of the simulations is the incorporation of time-dependent earthquake nucleation effects that cause space-time earthquake clustering such as foreshocks, aftershocks, and large event clusters. &nbsp;Because the simulations allow for alternate realizations of the fault model and different input parameters for physical properties, RSQSim offers advanced capabilities for investigating the physical processes controlling earthquake processes and effects. For example, space-time clustering of earthquakes, which is empirically well-characterized on a global scale, but poorly understood, has a strong impact on earthquake hazard assessments and post-earthquake relief activities. The simulations show, for the first time, the importance of local fault structure and loading conditions in controlling the clustering rate of large earthquakes (M&ge;7). &nbsp;The clustering rate is spatially variable and controlled in part by the structural complexity of the local fault system and local long-term fault slip rates (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>Figure 3 illustrates a result from Cascadia simulations with RSQSim for great earthquakes (M&ge;8.3). In this simulation, the strength of the fault interface was varied from North to South to tune the simulation to N-S variation of recurrence times of great earthquakes obtained by Goldfinger et al. (2012) from paleoseismic data. The average recurrence times of the great earthquakes, varied from about 550 years at the northern end of Cascadia to about 200 years at the southern end. With this tuning, the N-S slip pattern in the largest earthquakes are quite similar to one-another and consistent with coastal uplift/subsidence data for the great 1700 earthquake. Notably, without this tuning to recurrence times, the pattern of coastal uplift and subsidence were inconsistent with the 1700 earthquake data. The persistence of the slip distribution supports the concept that permanent physical features of the model largely control slip distribution in major earthquakes. Since coastal uplift/subsidence and tsunami inundation in great earthquakes are primarily controlled by the slip distribution, this result suggests that it may be possible to more accurately predict coastal subsidence and inundation in future Cascadia earthquakes.</p>\n<p>Criteria for seismic design of engineered structures critically depend on characteristics of earthquake ground motions, which are highly variable. This variability, in part, is thought to be due to the highly heterogeneous characteristics of the earth&rsquo;s crust at all scales of observation. An important component of this project has been to develop advanced capabilities for physics-based modeling earthquake ground motions, and to apply those models to understanding how persistent heterogeneities (e.g. fault geometry) and transient heterogeneities (e.g. fault stresses) affect rupture processes, and resulting earthquake ground motions. In summary:</p>\n<p>1. The project achieved its goal of calculating 0-8 Hz ground motion with 3D models incorporating power-law heterogeneity (in both the fault geometry and elastic medium wavespeed and density) at distances up to 60 km. The simulations show that small-scale (statistically defined) heterogeneity of the seismic wavespeed and density, brings the intra-event variability of modeled ground motions into better agreement with empirical observations than is achieved without the small-scale heterogeneity.</p>\n<p>2. Compared to smooth fault models, fault roughness greatly increases the variability of rupture-velocity distributions. Additionally, heterogeneity of stresses relative to fault strength has a significant effect on slip parameters like total slip, peak slip rate and rupture velocity.</p>\n<p>3. Nonlinear rock fault zone response, in the form Drucker-Prager yielding, was successfully incorporated into a high-performance, scalable earthquake simulation code, and was used to assess the significance of yielding on earthquake ground motion from both kinematic and dynamic rupture models. Figure 4 shows examples of simulations comparing ground motions with, and without, rock yielding at adjacent to the fault surface.</p>\n<p>Another focus of the project concerns the societally important topic of probabilistic earthquake hazard assessment. Current hazard assessment methods, such as the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecasts (UCERF), are based on earthquake statistics and involve a large number of uncertain model parameters, and huge number of logic tree branches, which are weighted by expert opinion. Figure 5 compares probabilistic maps of shaking hazard in California based on the earthquake simulator RSQSim and the UCERF3 assessment, which is most recent community model for California [Field, et al., 2014]. Using only global uniform parameters in the simulator, set to match earthquake stress drop scaling, we find strikingly good agreement of the long-term shaking hazard in the simulator compared with the California hazard model. This agreement from two vastly different approaches, provides a fundamental validation of a physics-based approach to probabilistic earthquake hazard assessments.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/26/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;H&nbsp;Dieterich</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516989334250_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516989334250_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"California fault system model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516989334250_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"California fault system model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 1</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dieterich</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;H&nbsp;Dieterich</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">California fault system model</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516989756473_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516989756473_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Earthquake Clustering\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516989756473_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Earthquake Clustering\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 2</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Gilchrist (unpublished)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;H&nbsp;Dieterich</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Earthquake Clustering</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516990015650_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516990015650_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cascadia simulations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516990015650_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cascadia simulations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 3</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Richards-Dinger et al.</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;H&nbsp;Dieterich</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cascadia simulations</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516990631050_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516990631050_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ground motion simulations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516990631050_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ground motion simulations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 4</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Olsen et al.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;H&nbsp;Dieterich</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ground motion simulations</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516992935500_Figure5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516992935500_Figure5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Hazard maps\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1135455/1135455_10127268_1516992935500_Figure5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Hazard maps\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig.5</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shaw et. al (2018</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;H&nbsp;Dieterich</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Hazard maps</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
