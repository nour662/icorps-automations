 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at The University of Tennessee exposes eight science and engineering undergraduates to an intensive summer research experience in the area of synthesis and characterization of advanced functional materials. Undergraduates are assigned a self-contained aspect of a larger research project and l work with graduate students and faculty who belong to the department of Materials Science and Engineering to complete their project. The research projects that the undergraduates participate in allow students to become actively involved in cutting-edge research, have access to state-of-the-art equipment, and interact with senior researchers who enrich their education and help them achieve their full potential.\r\n\r\nDisseminating research results is an important aspect of all REU student activities and each student presents his/her work in a formal oral or poster presentation at the end of summer.  A series of seminars is held at appropriate times to discuss research skills, technical communications (oral and written), ethical issues, and opportunities for graduate school.  Several additional activities are planned to provide opportunities for significant interaction among the students, including site visits to the nearby Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) and the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.",
