 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Stanford gravitational wave research program is engaged in research and development on gravitational wave detection for the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) program through its membership in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. The Stanford group's current objectives are guided by the LIGO 2008 Instrument Science Priority Matrix, and are devoted almost entirely to reducing risk and insuring the success of Advanced LIGO. Its major focus is on the development of highly sensitive optical coating and bulk optical absorption loss measurements, the effects of ultra-violet illumination on LIGO optical coatings, studies of dielectric coating and test-mass elastic dissipation, and the design of advanced seismic isolation systems and suspensions. Continuing improvements in these areas are sought for Advanced LIGO to increase its sensitivity and improve the likelihood for detections of gravitational waves.  Studies on understanding and minimizing thermal noise in the detector's core optics are being pursued to enhance Advanced LIGO's sensitivity in the critical intermediate frequency band.  Improved core optic suspensions and isolation platforms are being developed to enable higher sensitivity at low frequencies where ground vibrations currently limit performance. \r\n \r\nGravitational waves were predicted almost 90 years ago in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, but they have not yet been directly detected due to the extreme sensitivity required. Interacting black holes, coalescing compact binary stellar systems, stellar collapses, pulsars and low mass X-ray binaries are all possible sources of gravitational waves, as is the random background of radiation from the early universe. The first generation of laser interferometer detectors, which operate by measuring strains in the fabric of space-time expected to be produced by gravitational waves, have collected data for several years. Second generation, higher performance detectors, such as Advanced LIGO now under construction, should allow us to develop gravitational wave astronomy as a new window on the Universe. The Stanford group has a strong, multidisciplinary program in developing the technology for such detectors.  Participants include mechanical, electrical and control engineers, physicists and materials researchers. The program provides training for future scientists and engineers at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, it integrates basic scientific research with scientific education, and it develops and funds outreach programs that inform and educate the broader community.",
