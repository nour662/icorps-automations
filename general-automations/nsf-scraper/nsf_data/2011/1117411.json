 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social networks (SNs), including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn have developed on the Internet to become a leading paradigm of online interaction. SNs have been successful in attracting users, and providing a medium where users can easily share and distribute content. Such open availability of data exposes SN users to a number of security and privacy risks. Current SN architectures adopt a simple user centric policy management approach, where a security aware user is able to specify a policy that manages access to their posted content. However, the majority of users lack appropriate information to make informed privacy decisions.\r\n  \r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive and compelling framework that leverages data mining approaches and policies composed by other community members to provide the user with appropriate information required when making policy decisions. The wisdom of the community is aggregated and summarized to assist users when making policy decisions related to user-to-user interactions, and third party applications. The principal intellectual products resulting from this project will be the development of novel policy management frameworks that focuses on both usability, and leverages data mining, recommendations and policy sharing techniques to consult the SN community to aid in enhancing users? privacy policies. \r\n\r\nThis project has a broad societal impact on new business and community models for sharing on SNs, providing mechanisms that enable users to make more informed access decisions. In addition this project will support graduate and undergraduate students, and will engage K-12 students and enhance their understanding of privacy in SNs.",

We proposed a multicriteria recommendation model that utilizes application-based, user-based, and category-based collaborative filtering mechanisms. Our collaborative filtering mechanisms are based on previous user decisions, and application permission requests to enhance the privacy of the overall site&rsquo;s user population. We implemented our proposed OAuth extension as a browser extension that allows users to easily configure their privacy settings at application installation time, provides recommendations on requested privacy permissions, and collects data regarding user decisions.

In the context of browser 3rd party applicaitons, we implemented a runtime framework as a browser extension called REM. REM monitors the accesses made by 3rd party Chrome extensions, informs users of the accesses, and allows them to customize the permissions given to extensions.
