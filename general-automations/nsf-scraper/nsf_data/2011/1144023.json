It is an important objective, which extends beyond nanotechnology to other emerging technologies.  In addition, this symposium/workshop serves to provide economic information to the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\nThis project aims to elucidate long term return on investment (ROI) from national investments in new science and technology research through a symposium/workshop vehicle.  The project involves two parts: a Symposium on the Economic Value of Nanotechnology, followed by a Round Table that aims to scope the specific needs of governments in this field and to identify collaborative work to meet those needs. The first part will gather information and expert opinion on the appropriate metrics for evaluating the economic impact of nanotechnology generally, which would be a first step towards evaluating the economic impact of the NNI specifically.\r\n\r\nThe organizers intend to engage stakeholders to explore the issues involved in national innovation initiatives and their underlying laws, strategies, workforce issues, etc.,  first, in a single-day symposium on the economic value of nanotechnology and then in a single-day roundtable workshop on how stakeholders can work together to fulfill needs identified on the first day.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:\r\nThe results of this symposium/workshop would be of value to the US Government, particularly those agencies involved in planning future support for NNI projects. In addition, the symposium/workshop will help collaborations among governments to increase the economic impact of research in nanotechnology.",
