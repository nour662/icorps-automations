The central theorem in the\r\nsubject is Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry (HMS)\r\nconjecture.  The principal investigator proposes to prove this\r\nconjecture using his recent work with collaborators. Connections\r\nbetween mathematical physics and topology, representation theory,\r\nand combinatorics have been revealed through the PI's research\r\nwith Nadler and with Fang, Liu and Treumann.  What emerges is a\r\nlanguage for studying mirror symmetry and other advances in\r\nmathematical physics from a simple, geometric viewpoint which\r\neasily lends itself to computation.  This perspective renders\r\nsome formidable hurdles of HMS rather tractable. The PI will,\r\nwith collaborators and graduate students, aim to prove HMS in\r\nseveral stages.  First, by defining a category, the Constructible\r\nPlumbing Model (CPM), which models the Fukaya category of a\r\nCalabi-Yau manifold at its large radius limit by defining a\r\nformal Lagrangian skeleton and gluing together categories of\r\nconstructible sheaves made from pieces of the skeleton.  Second,\r\nby proving that CPM is equivalent to the category of perfect\r\ncomplexes on the mirror Calabi-Yau at its large complex limit\r\npoint.  After these steps, a deformation-of-categories argument\r\ncan be made to establish a mirror map and prove HMS.\r\n\r\nThe aim of string theory is to merge the two pillars of modern\r\nphysics: Einstein's theory of gravity and the quantum theory of\r\nparticles.  Models of the universe from string theory rely on a\r\nclass of geometric spaces called Calabi-Yau manifolds.\r\nCalculations in these models are quite formidable, but are often\r\nmade tractable through the phenomenon of mirror symmetry.  The\r\nidea of mirror symmetry is that one theory can look totally\r\ndifferent from another theory, but the two lead to the same\r\npredictions.  Hard calculations using one Calabi-Yau manifold can\r\nbecome easy calculations in the completely different \"mirror\"\r\nCalabi-Yau manifold.  But to be truly useful, one must have\r\ncomplete confidence in the equivalence, namely that the\r\ncalculations in the mirror theory can be trusted.  This requires\r\na rigorous mathematical formulation of the model, a rigorous\r\nstatement of how to apply the equivalence, and a rigorous proof\r\nthat the equivalence is, in fact, true.  The statements in mirror\r\nsymmetry have been made rigorous by Fields Medal laureate Maxim\r\nKontsevich.  What is still lacking is a general proof of\r\nKontsevich's conjecture.  The principal investigator proposes to\r\nprove this conjecture in several steps, using a simple geometric\r\nmodel which easily lends itself to calculations. The model can\r\nalso serve as a framework for exploring other predications and\r\nphenomena of modern theoretical physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThis project involves an investigation into some mathematical structures unearthed by theoretical physics.  The main area is called \"mirror symmetry.\"  The name \"mirror\" is only a hint at the story, in that inside the looking glass is a world different from our own which mimics ours.  In the context of theoretical physics, the name refers to two different theories of physics which lead to the same predictions.  Since each theory is modeled in its own mathematical way, the fact that two theories can lead to the same predictions means that two sets of mathematical calculations arrive at the same result.  What emerges is a profound linkage between different areas of mathematics, most succinctly (but a bit crudely) described as a deep relationship between the field concerned with the \"size\" of things and the field concerned with the \"shape\" of things.  The fields are symplectic geometry and complex geometry.\n\n \n\nOne way to prove that two different things are the same is to show that they are both the same as a third thing, a middle ground between the two.  The main results from the project take place in this middle ground.\n\n \n\nWhen two spaces give rise to the same physics, there can be an underlying common \"skeleton\" which is essential to both.  With Ruddat-Sibilla-Treumann we gave an explicit description of such a skeleton.  Using this skeleton, we can give a sheaf-theoretic description of the two sides (sheaf theory provides the middle ground) of the mirror equivalence, following joint work with Sibilla-Treumann.  With Shende-Treumann we gave a detailed description of the sheaf-theory story in the case of a theory defined by a knot, i.e. a loop in three-dimensional space.  This simple setting proved to reveal rich structures.  With Ng-Rutherford-Shende-Sivek, we related this entire story of a knot to parallel developments in symplectic geometry -- so we explained the sheaf-symplectic relationship in this context.  In future work, we will tell this sheaf-theoretic story in higher dimensions, where we have not only the duality called mirror symmetry to explain, but the mysterious \"large-N\" duality of Gopakumar-Vafa and Ooguri-Vafa.\n\n \n\nIn addition to these research merits, the PI has engaged in many activities developing the careers of young scientistis, including holding workshops and conferences, creating a math circle in the PI's hometown, leading the math portion of a bridge program at Northwestern aimed at incoming freshmen interested in STEM fields (including many underrepresented minorities), and mentoring Ph.D. students and postdocs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/20/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Zaslow"
