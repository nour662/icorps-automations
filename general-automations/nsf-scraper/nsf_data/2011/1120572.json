 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insect-mediated pollination is a critical, and often limiting, step in the reproductive cycle of many wild plants and crops.  Thus, understanding the effects of losing pollinator species is a question of central importance for the long-term persistence of healthy, functioning ecosystems and for the security and productivity of our agricultural enterprise.  This project focuses on pollinator floral fidelity, or how closely a single pollinator species interacts with a single plant species over the short term.  Such fidelity is of key importance to plants, because pollinators with low fidelity visit many different plant species in a single foraging trip, thus transferring the wrong kind of pollen between individual plants and reducing the number of seeds they produce.  This project will investigate the hypothesis that competition between pollinator species is positively related to pollinator floral fidelity.  If this hypothesis is true, as is suggested by theory and pilot data, loss of pollinator species or populations could reduce floral fidelity in the pollinators that remain, thereby leading to unanticipated reductions in plant reproduction.  To test this, manipulative experiments will be conducted in subalpine meadows in the Colorado Rockies where we selectively - but temporarily and non-lethally - remove an abundant pollinator species from a plot, and assess the floral fidelity of other pollinators both before and after the manipulation.  The effects of these pollinator removals on plant reproduction will also be preliminarily assessed.  In addition, this project investigates flower fidelity in experimental foraging trials in the lab, where pollinator and plant diversity and abundance can be controlled.  This work may have implications for the effects of pollinator losses on plant reproduction, especially given ongoing pollinator declines around the world.\r\n\r\nBeyond the research results, the broader impacts of this project include its conservation implications; the training of a post-doctoral research fellow; improvements to the pollen and bee reference collections at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory; and development of a pollination classroom module for fourth graders that will be implemented in under-resourced schools in Atlanta and widely disseminated.",

Computer simulation models have suggested that plants will be highly resilient to the loss of pollinator species, because most pollinator species visit many plant species, and most plant species are, in turn, visited by many pollinators. Thus, when one pollinator species is lost, plants have &ldquo;backup&rdquo; in the form of other pollinators. These simulation models, however, assume that pollinator behavior remains constant when competing pollinators are lost. We hypothesized, based on ecological theory, that pollinator species losses would change the behavior of remaining pollinators in a system, reducing their &ldquo;floral fidelity&rdquo; (meaning they would visit multiple different plant species in a single foraging trip). We further hypothesized that such losses in pollinator floral fidelity would have negative impacts on plant pollination and ultimately seed production by plants. This is because plants need pollen from the same species in order to be fertilized and produce viable seed. To test these hypotheses, we conducted experiments in which we temporarily, non-destructively removed the most common bumble bee species from multiple replicated small plots (20 x 20 meters) in subalpine meadows in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. We compared each plot in a control state, without species removals, and in a manipulated (species-removal) state. We assessed the floral fidelity of remaining bumble bees, both by directly observing their foraging behavior and by assessing the pollen they were carrying. We measured pollen deposition on flowers and seed production by those flowers, in a target wildflower, the Larkspur <em>Delphinium barbeyi</em>. We repeated these experiments over several summer growing seasons. We found that removing a single bumble bee species reduced the floral fidelity of remaining bees, and that led to more of the wrong kind of pollen being deposited on plants, as well as fewer seeds produced per flower. These results indicate that losing pollinator species is likely to have negative impacts on plant reproduction, in contrast to the suggestions of computer simulation models. This work also contributes a new mechanism by which biodiversity&mdash;in this case, more species of bees&mdash;can drive ecological functioning. In addition to this field work, we also conducted behavioral experiments in a laboratory setting with 1-4 bee species foraging on artificial flowers (like hummingbird feeders for bees), and new computer models of plant-pollinator interactions, including validating model results with field data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts: This project has broader impacts in terms of scientific training, educational outreach, and conservation.
