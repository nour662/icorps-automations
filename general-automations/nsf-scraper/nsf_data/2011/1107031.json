 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of the properties of Levy-driven CARMA (continuous-time ARMA) processes will be undertaken and efficient methods of inference developed. The results will be applied to the study of stochastic volatility models with Levy-driven CARMA volatility that have applications that go beyond finance to turbulence and some neuroscience processes.  Time series in which the parameters are constant over time-intervals between change-points constitute an important class of non-stationary time series which has been found particularly useful in hydrology, seismology, neuroscience, environmental science and finance. Properties and applications of a new estimation technique based on the minimization of the minimum description length of a model that includes the number of change-points and their locations as parameters will be developed and extended to cover a general class of processes with structural breaks. It is hoped that this technique can also be adapted for detection of both additive and innovational outliers.  Linear and nonlinear models for multivariate time series, with a view towards modeling temporal brain dynamics, will also play a major role in this research proposal. These models include a mixture of possibly nonlinear vector autoregressions and a class of not necessarily causal vector autoregressions. The latter class, although linear, exhibits features previously only associated with nonlinear models and allows for the possibility of foresight in the sense of dependence of one or more components of future shocks.\r\n \r\nIn the last fifteen years, there has been a widely-recognized need for the development of new models and techniques for the analysis of time series data from scientific, engineering, biomedical, financial, and neuroscience applications.  Some of the features required of these new models are nonlinearity, complex dependence structures, strong deviations from normality and non-stationarity.  In neuroscience, environmental and financial modeling there is also a demand for continuous-time models which incorporate these features.  The current proposal addresses these needs. It seeks to enhance understanding of the physical, biomedical, and economic processes represented by the models. The development of efficient estimation and simulation techniques will be an essential component of the research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTime series is a branch of mathematical statistics with the ability to analyze and forecast data collected over time such as monthly unemployment data,  air temperature at a particular location  or  closing daily stock prices, to name just a few examples.  Classical time series analysis deals with observations which are uniformly spaced in time and which are often assumed to be randomly distributed with an underlying normal distribution.  However in practice we often encounter data which are integer-valued, e.g., daily hospital admissions,  data which exhibit occasional bursts of high variability, e.g. stock prices, data which are recorded  at irregularly spaced times and data which are recorded with extremely high frequency, e.g. wind speeds under turbulent conditions.  The behavior of the data may also exhibit apparent sudden changes in character, for example stream flows in  a river before and after the construction of a dam.    \n\nThe aim of this research is to extend classical time series analysis to handle the problems associated with deviations of the data from the standard  assumptions in order  to obtain more realistic representations of the data  and correspondingly better forecasts.\n\nIn conjunction with a graduate student and colleagues from Hong Kong, Professor Davis developed new models to describe integer-valued time series which allow for non-linear behaviour, reflected in the data by outlying values and irregular bursts of observations.  The most successful models for stock prices have been models with continuous time-parameter, in particular the Geometric Brownian Motion model on the basis of which the Nobel Prize winners Merton and Scholes based their celebrated option-pricing formulae.  However their model incorporates constant volatility whereas in practice volatility is observed to vary with time in an apparently random manner.  To reflect this property  Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard introduced a continuous-time stochastic volatility model for stock prices.  Brockwell and Lindner studied a more general model for stochastic volatility which accounts more realistically for the daily realized volatility observed in stock prices.  The class of so-called CARMA models which they used prove to be useful in other contexts where a continuous-time model is appropriate.  These include the analysis and forecasting of irregularly spaced data and the analysis of data which is sampled at high frequency from an underlying continuous-time process.  In this situation the connection between the sampled process and the underlying continuous-time process is critical and was made clear in two papers by Brockwell, Klueppelberg and Ferrazzano.  To deal with sudden changes of character in a time series, in particular to identify the time of occurrence and nature of the change, Professor Davis, together with Thomas Lee and former graduate student Gabriel Rodrigues-Yam investigated applications of the algorithm Autoparm which they developed for this purpose. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/19/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard A Davis"
