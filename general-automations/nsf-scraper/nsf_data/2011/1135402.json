The events bring together scholars currently making important contributions, early career mathematicians, and students working in the field. The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.\r\n\r\nConference web site: http://www.math.okstate.edu/ok_pde_workshop",
