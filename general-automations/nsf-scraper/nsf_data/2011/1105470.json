 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Damon has been investigating problems involving the geometry, topology and deformation properties of singular structures, including stratified sets, mappings, and nonisolated singularities, and the application of these results for developing geometric methods for problems in computer imaging. He proposes to further develop his work which applies to computer imaging and also continue his theoretical work, based on recent discoveries, on the properties of highly nonisolated singularities. He will extend the methods involving \"skeletal structures\", which he introduced to capture the shape of objects in any dimension, to obtain \"skeletal/medial linking structures\" for configurations of multiple objects in images. Such a linking structure will provide a mathematical structure which could be used for: the statistical analysis of medical images involving multiple physiological features, improved segmentation in images, and providing a rigorous unified mathematical framework for analyzing the interaction of positional and shape information in images. As well his work will develop new methods for studying highly nonisolated singularities whose topology has been beyond the reach of previous methods developed for isolated singularities. This involves determining the \"vanishing topology\" of the singularities as well as the topology of the complements and Milnor fibers for (highly singular) \"free divisors\" which naturally arise from representation theory of solvable linear algebraic groups.\r\n\r\nThe proposed investigations to be carried out under this grant will concern both theoretical work on singular spaces and its application to problems in medical imaging. Singular spaces, which are different from our usual image of smoothly bending objects, inevitably arise in the study of smooth objects. In the case of configurations of smooth objects, the investigator will develop appropriate singular structures which allow for the simultaneous analysis of the shapes of the individual objects and their positional relations. Such structures can be used for various imaging problems, such as for 3D medical images, where for treatment and diagnosis, the exact relative position and features of multiple physiological features must be determined. This will involve joint work with several groups of computer scientists. The investigator will also investigate the properties of these singular spaces when their structure is highly singular and cannot be understood using traditional methods. He is developing a new method for both simplifying the qualitative structure of such singularities and providing explicit algebraic methods for computing qualitative numerical invariants of the structures.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n       The research supported on this grant concerned developing methods in \"singularity theory\" and applying the results via geometry to problems in computer imaging.  Singularity theory can be roughly described as the study of systems of nonlinear equations and their sets of solutions, allowing various types of restrictions.  This study also includes how the properties of both the equations themselves and also their solutions change under small perturbations, i.e. small changes, of the equations.  This involves both identifying when no changes will occur (so they are \"stable\") and otherwise identifying all possible changes that are possible.   \n\n      The research developed four areas in singularity theory with applications of three of these to problems in computer imaging.   \n\n       The first area concerned local features in natural images such as visual or camera images resulting from reflected light off objects  These involve the geometric features of objects, shade and shadows on objects from a light source, and apparent edges arising from the viewing direction.  The research, carried out jointly with two coworkers, used singularity theory applied to the projections in both the light and viewing directions to identify those local features which remain unchanged under viewer movement and those changes which typically occur under continuous change of viewing direction.  These results help identify object boundaries in images and identify the main problems for computer edge detection methods along with proposed methods for how to overcome them. \n\n       The second area concerned identifying and analyzing collections of objects such as organs, arteries, bones, etc in two and three dimensional medical images.  Joint work with a former graduate student introduced a \"medial/skeletal linking structure\" for capturing both the shapes of the individual objects and their relative positions, using singularity theoretic properties of multiple functions associated to the objects.  The properties of this structure have been identified and used to introduce numerical measures for using these structures in modeling configurations of objects.  Already for the case of single objects, the \"skeletal structure\" provides a mathematical basis for using computer generated model-fitting by the group of computer scientists at UNC with whom the investigator works.  This has led to commercial software for imaging the male pelvic area. \n\n       Third, for potential uses in the second area, the investigator with coworkers developed new methods for computer generated structures for single objects when they can be described by a special mathematical form using \"b-splines\".  This approach has the advantage over methods which use a discrete model for the boundaries of objects by providing a precise unambiguous construction of the structure.  This approach has the potential to be useful for configurations of objects as well. \n\n       The fourth area involves the equations representing varying entrees in a rectangular array which forms a matrix.  The use of matrices is pervasive throughout mathematics and science and the properties of particular types of matrices is crucial.  As the entries in the equations vary, the properties of the matrix changes, and understanding the set of values where given properties occur is fundamental for many problems.  The investigator with another former graduate student have introduced one method to determine the properties of the spaces where given properties appear.  This involves the qualitative properties of the space when the matrices are stabilized, and they are obtained from properties of certain associated spaces where the properties can be explicitly computed.\n\n       A second method which has been developed by the investigator applies instead to the entire space of matrices with given properties by using the properties of the set of transformations for the matrices, i. e. \"transformation group\", of the given type. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James N Damon"
