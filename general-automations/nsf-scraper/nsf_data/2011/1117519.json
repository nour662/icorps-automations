In nature, bacteria utilize chemical signaling to execute controlled movement, communication, and collaborative task completion. Chemotactic response (i.e. biased random walk of bacteria towards a chemo-attractant source) enables effective sensing and creates a biased distribution of bacteria in a field. Quorum sensing allows a robust collective response to be achieved at specific bacteria number densities. In this project, we developed the scientific knowledge and the technology needed in order to exploit the sophisticated and robust machinery of bacteria for actuation, sensing, communication, and control of a new class of micron scale (characteristic length: 2-10 &mu;m) robotic systems called &ldquo;BacteriaBots&rdquo;.
