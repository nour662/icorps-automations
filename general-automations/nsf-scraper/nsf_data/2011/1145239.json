The format of the conference will facilitate the exchange of information between individuals with clinical and individuals with technical expertise. Clinicians will be provided up-to-date information about technology relevant to implement Personalized Medicine strategies. Engineers will be given the opportunity to find out what are the major roadblocks toward the improvement of Healthcare via the four selected themes: Healthcare Reform and Health IT Adoption,, Workflow and Health IT, Clinical decision Support Systems and Individualized Medicine, and Improving Outcomes and Quality.\r\n\r\nThe organizers will provide the public at large with access to the conference material by implementing multiple strategies. First of all, they have set up a blog on the conference website. The blog will provide individuals interested in the conference with the opportunity to shape the conference by posting questions, by proposing discussion topics, and by providing information about their own work. Secondly, all the conference abstracts will be made available to the public at large via an open access initiative that the organizer will implement on the conference website. In other words, abstracts will be posted on the conference website. Finally, they will select contributions among those presented at the conference for the first issue of a new magazine that AMA and IEEE EMBS intend to launch within a year from completion of the conference.",
