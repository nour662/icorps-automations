 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this RUI project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Brian K. Ohta of Villanova University will investigate the chemical structure of various halonium ions, positively charged molecules that contain a halogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms.  Specifically, he will determine whether they exist as a single symmetric ion or in a rapid equilibrium of multiple asymmetric ions. The overall approach is to use isotopic perturbation of equilibrium to determine whether a halonium ion, generated under superacidic conditions, adopts a symmetric or asymmetric structure. In conjunction with the experimental determination of their symmetry, a combination of experimental and computational techniques will be used to understand the factors that influence the symmetry of halonium ions.  \r\n\r\nThe symmetry of halonium ions broadly impacts the understanding of how the subtle structural features of high-energy reactive intermediates can influence chemical reactions.  The project emphasizes the training of undergraduate and postdoctoral researchers through an investigation that requires synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational techniques to study fundamental reaction mechanisms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe general goal of this project is to provide insight into how organic chemicals transform their structures during a reaction.  To this end, our group uses all the tools of modern organic chemistry (chemical synthesis, spectroscopy, computation, kinetics, etc) to answer fundamental questions regarding the structural dynamics throughout a reaction.  In some reactions, intermediates (temporary, semi-stable structures) may exist along a reaction path.  In this project, our group focused on a particular reaction, halogenation, and the structure of its proposed intermediate, the halonium ion.\n\nHalonium ions are typically drawn as positively charged halogen atoms bonded to two carbon atoms.  What is remarkable and unusual about the halonium ion is the fact that halogen atoms typically make one bond, yet halonium ions are drawn with two equal bonds.  The existence of the halonium ion was initially inferred from the very specific products that were produced from the reaction.  Since its proposal, the halonium ion has been widely adopted and appears in most introductory organic chemistry textbooks.\n\nThough typically drawn as a single symmetric structure with two equal carbon halogen bonds, it is also reasonable to hypothesize that the ion exists as an asymmetric structure with unequal bonds that rapidly interconverts with another asymmetric structure.  This subtle difference between a single symmetric structure and two rapidly interconvering asymmetric structures is analogous to a famous debate regarding whether carbonium ions (positively charged carbon atoms with more bonds than usual) existed as singularly symmetric or dually asymmetric.  Our experimental approach to the halonium ion structure is inspired by the experiments undertaken to resolve the carbonium ion?s structure.  Specifically, the proposed experiments rely on isotopic perturbation of equilibrium, a method specifically designed to determine if a molecule exists as a single structure or as multiple structures rapidly interconverting.\n\nThe most important tool for determining structure in organic chemistry is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  NMR spectroscopy is considered a slow spectroscopy and averages any chemical changes during the measurement; analogous to a camera taking a picture with a long shutter speed.  Thus, the single symmetric structure and the averaged interconverting structures are expected to give the same result.  However, if you can change the relative stabilities of the multiple structures that are being averaged, the results will have predictable changes from the single symmetric structure.  In isotopic perturbation of equilibrium, an asymmetric displacement of isotopes is used to provide a small but measureable change necessary to distinguish between symmetric and asymmetric structures.\n\nIn one aspect, this research project was ideally suited as an initial starting point for undergraduate researchers.  As sophomores, students learn about the halogenation reaction and how halonium ions explain the observed products.  Later, through independent research, the students in my group are able to test the veracity of the structure they see in their textbook.  But on the other hand, the experiments were highly sophisticated and potentially hazardous.  The biggest challenge for the project has been balancing the educational aims of the project while completing the work in an appropriately safe manner.\n\nMirroring the outcomes of other science majors at Villanova University, the two undergraduates from by this grant have gone on to medical school and one undergraduate went to work for Johnson &amp; Johnson.  The postdoctoral candidate that was funded by this proposal accepted a tenure-track professorship at Samford University, a primarily undergraduate university similar to Villanova University.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian K Ohta"
