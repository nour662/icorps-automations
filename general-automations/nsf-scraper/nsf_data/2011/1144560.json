 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a concentrated set of activities intended to expedite the systems innovations and renovations necessary for the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) to remain responsive to changing opportunities for STEM education. This project is a strategy to leverage the successes and lessons of several recent pilot projects, bring them to scale, iterate toward additional improvements, and integrate new capacities into NSDL's baseline value propositions. Goals and activities for the work focus on Transitioning NSDL's Technical Infrastructure, Transitioning Library Collections, and Redefining NSDL's Network Effects - all toward evolving the library to an NSDL 3.0 model that is a responsive tool for the next generation of digital learning. The project is led by teams currently involved in the operations of the NSDL Resource Center and Technical Network Services. Investigators are also partnering with a cadre of eight previously funded NSDL Pathways projects as an advance team for the NSDL community to co-create new processes, policies, shared practices, and collaborative resource collections - all designed to create new opportunities for educational impact and additional points of sustainability leverage, both for the NSDL network of educational resources and services providers and its associated partners.",
