 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Silvia Centeno of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and Prof. Cecil Dybowski of the University of Delaware, will study the mechanism of aggregation of Lead carboxylates (lead soaps) in oil paintings. Aggregation of Lead carboxylates in oil paintings is known to lead to the formation of protrusions and paint loss in most cases, and to increased transparency of the paint films in others, resulting in damage to the integrity of the artworks. While widely observed, the phenomenon is not well understood. The collaborating investigators, their students and postdoctoral trainees will determine the structure, molecular dynamics, and phase behavior of lead carboxylates using solid state 13C,207Pb magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 1H-207Pb and 13C- 207Pb dipolar re-coupling experiments, and deuterium NMR along with other analytical tools. They will elucidate the mechanism of aggregate formation/migration and based on the results, recommend procedures to arrest the deterioration process of oil paintings.\r\n\r\nThe solid state NMR experiments have the potential to transform the field of cultural heritage science since they will provide molecular information, which is not currently available to the cultural heritage science community. The experiments are a gateway to the application of emerging minimally invasive NMR methods like micro-MAS NMR to study cultural heritage objects. Advancing the state of the art for 207Pb solid-state NMR also has broader implications for understanding the structure of lead-containing electronic and optoelectronic materials, high-Tc superconducting materials, and the speciation and reaction of lead in environmentally contaminated materials. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to students and postdoctoral researchers who wish to train in state of the art solid state NMR methods and cultural heritage science.  Results of this study will be widely disseminated to the public through museum programs and publications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has supported research into chemical reactions in paints that ultimately cause the deterioration of some of the masterworks of art from the 14th through the 20th century.  If allowed to continue, such rections may cause the loss of some of humanity's great achievements.  The particular process that intitiated this study is the production of soaps by reaction of pigment-derived ions with fatty acids that are in the paint matrix.  The effects of this process are seen in paintings in museums acorss the world, to varying degrees.\n\nThe intellectual merit of the research arises from the development of new techniques to apply nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a major tool for the identification of materials, to identify and quantify the production of lead soaps (materials produced from fatty acids and lead ions) in model paints.  The nature of NMR spectra of lead in these materials requires one to acquire the spectra in a manner very different from the usual way o acquiring spectra of other materials.  The first part of the study was determining the best spectroscopic technique to determine spectra most efficiently.  With the selected technique (called WURST-CPMG spectroscopy), we were able to identify spectroscopic signatures for various lead-containing soaps.  The results demonstrat that one can distinguish, on the basis of NMR characteristics, soaps made with different fatty acids.  We further used sophsiticated calculational techniques to predict the NMR properties of the lead sopas, which alloed identification of these in complex materials.  Using NMR technology, the course of a reaction between palmitic acid (a fatty acid) and a lead base pigment in a model paint film was monitored.\n\nThe broader impacts of the project are found in the general applications of the heavy-nucleus NMR spectroscopy to a variety of solid materials, not just paints.  Lead centers are found in paints, but they are also found in many other technologically important materials such as semiconductors and electronic components.  Under this project, two graduate students have obtained Ph.D. degrees, and a postdoctoral fellow (Ph.D. in biochemistry) has been trained not only in NMR in materials chemistry, but also in art conservation.  The postdocotral fellow has recently joinded the faculty of a chemistry department, but she continues to collaborate with the PIs on extension of the projec to address the reactions.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cecil R Dybowski"
