 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project combines efforts of the EDUCATION CONNECTION Center for 21st Century Skills with the Education Development Center  (its research partner), and K-12 school districts to develop, implement, study, and evaluate an innovative STEM career academy model.   A consortium of state colleges and universities (as well as other entities) helps to fully integrate cyberlearning and content courses in STEM with digital arts and media.   The consortium includes Southern Connecticut (CT) State University, CT College of Technology, CT Office for Workforce Competitiveness, CT State Department of Education, and CT Pre-Engineering Program.  This group intends to significantly increase the career interests of underrepresented students and improve their readiness for college-level coursework in STEM and ICT fields.  \r\n\r\nPrior NSF-funded projects and existing state supported programs (e.g. ATE project and Connecticut Career Choices or CCC) contribute to the foundation for the proposed Connecticut Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences (DAS Academy) project.  Together, the partnership expands the focus from six high schools in 2002 to over 30 high schools in 2010.  \r\n\r\nInteractive online STEM/ICT coursework reaches over 1,200 students.  Forty percent of these students are minorities.   Students in the DAS Academy will be selected from four urban, four suburban and four rural high schools.  The DAS Academy offers eligible students up to 15 college credits through the CT community colleges and universities.   Participating teachers receive intensive professional development to advance skills and knowledge in STEM/ICT education, technology-rich instruction and 21st Century workforce standards.  These skills help teachers guide students through the online coursework.",

The project contributes to the research knowledge base about STEM education.\n\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT:\n\nSTEM Academic Courses were delivered in a \"blended learning\" environment, including online and in-person instruction in the classroom.  As part of the integrated curriculum, thousands of high school students and teachers participated in authentic learning experiences in class, on college campuses, and at industry sites to strengthen interest and commitment to pursuing STEM-related college degrees and careers.  A culminating STEM challenge project was evaluated annually at the Student Innovation Exposition. Replicable strategies include the integration of the Academy in high schools serving a large proportion of minority students; ongoing interaction among students, educators, and STEM professionals; the incentive of earning college credit while in high school; and intensive professional development for educators.  Funding allowed for the expansion of the Academy with three additional courses: Algebra21, Geometry21, and Game Design &amp; Development.\n\nMajor Accomplishments included:\n\nComplete Development of DAS Academy Curriculum.  New courses developed, piloted, and evaluated were:  Algebra21, Geometry21, and Game Design &amp; Development\n\nProvide experiential learning for students and teachers at CT College and corporate campus locations.\n\nExperiential Learning. Experiential learning took place at various industry and academic sites for all students.  An annual culminating Student Innovation Exposition showcased the work of the students. \n\nTeacher Professional Development.  Three summer institutes, serving over 150 teachers with over 600 complementary in-class/on-site coaching and mentoring sessions were completed.\n\nProgram Evaluation. Formative and summative evaluation assessed findings to improve effectiveness of program model.\n\nBROADER IMPACTS:\n\nOver the course of the 3-year funding period, the DAS Academy served a diverse group of students from urban and suburban schools. Students participating in either the full Academy or individual courses or programs numbered over 6000.  Of those students, 47% were female and 53% were male.

Using a sample of 540 students (male n=265; female n=212; free-and-reduced lunch n=212; non-white n=252), the study determined if there were significant differences between students participating in the DAS intervention and those who were not for interest in college and science achievement.  In addition, subgroup analysis examined impacts of gender, ethnicity, socio-economi..."
