 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reproduction requires successful interactions among the various participants, including mothers, fathers, and offspring, at many different levels, from whole organisms to molecules.  However, the process of reproduction often involves competition among individuals of the same sex as well as conflict between the sexes or between offspring and parents.  Competition and conflict are believed to spark an evolutionary arms race between reproductive proteins of males and those of females, but this hypothesis has yet to be definitively tested.  The present study will test this hypothesis by using next-generation sequencing to quantify patterns of evolution in the genes that encode reproductive proteins in pipefishes and seahorses.  This group is a particularly interesting one in which to examine patterns of reproductive protein evolution, because distinct species differ with respect to levels of sexual competition and conflict.\r\n\r\nThis project is scientifically important because it will contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary processes that have contributed to the molecular underpinnings of reproduction.  Such knowledge is necessary for a general understanding of the various ways in which proteins from males, females, and offspring interact to result in successful reproduction in humans and other animals.  This project will also have a number of broader impacts.  For example, several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in cutting-edge approaches in molecular genetics and integrated into the global research community through international collaboration.  This research will also be publicized through local and national outreach, including publication in leading journals, on websites, and in the popular press.",

This observation has led to the hypothesis that these genes are changing over time as a result of sexual selection or sexual conflict. This hypothesis predicts, in turn, that the mating patterns of species should be related to the operation of selection on genes involved in reproduction. The goal of this project was to test this hypothesis in pipefishes and seahorses, a taxonomic group that has become a model system for the study of sexual selection. We used modern, next-generation approaches to obtain the sequences of genes expressed in reproductive tissues of multiple species of pipefishes and seahorses. By comparing these sequences, we were able to examine patterns of change over time. The results of these analyses support the idea that sexual selection and mating systems play a role in how reproductive genes change over time. In addition, this project investigated mating patterns in a number of seahorses and pipefishes, showing that the dwarf seahorse and bluestripe pipefish are both monogamous, whereas the northern pipefish is not. The project also contributed in other ways to the goal of identifying regions of the genome under sexual selection. For instance, this project explored comparative population genomics and genome-wide selection components analysis as promising approaches. Each of these techniques examines changes in the frequencies of alleles (i.e., different forms of a gene) over space or time to find regions of the genome that are changing faster than can be explained by random fluctuations in allele frequencies. With respect to broader impacts, this project trained numerous graduate students and undergraduates, all of whom moved on to pursue their career goals.
