SUNY at Binghamton, Villanova University and the University of Texas at Arlington are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with SUNY at Binghamton as the lead institution \r\n\r\nThe proposed center will focus on the development of systematic methodologies for operating electronic systems, including data centers, as dynamic self sensing and regulating systems that are predictive and verified in real time. Algorithms will be developed to control cooling resources and to assist expert system schedulers to schedule and/or migrate workload to achieve optimal energy consumption. Thermal management resources will also be allocated dynamically in response to system needs. Problem-oriented research related to Thermal Management Protocols, Software Systems, Control Systems, and Implementation and Assessment, will be addressed during the Center's first five year program. \r\n\r\nThe proposed center will enable a significant reduction in energy consumption in electronic systems, including data centers, thereby potentially reducing electrical power consumption across the nation. This will, in turn, reduce the nations consumption of carbon-based fuels and related emissions. The center will attract a diverse group of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, by providing industrially-relevant training required by graduates entering the workforce. The proposed center is committed to attracting talented and motivated students from all groups, and will integrate a variety of mechanisms across the partners, including enhancement of existing minority pipeline programs to exceed participation by women and under-represented students. The center also intends to leverage existing programming on its campuses to engage K-12 students in conversation on energy conservation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant funded the NSF Center for Energy Smart Electronic Systems (ES2) at Villanova University.  ES2 is a collaborative university/industry research center in which universities and companies work together to solve the energy efficiency issues facing the data center market.  Villanova is one of four university sites in the center, and brings five industrial members to the center.\n\nOver the duration of the five-year grant, the Villanova faculty team and their industry partners have worked on several activities that are impactful to data center design.  These include the development of a software tool which can analyze the energy inefficiencies in a data center.  This software (VTAS) has been of great interest to the industry members and Villanova is looking into commercialization opportunities.  Thus, this software development has been of significant intellectual merit.\n\nOther research done by ES2 faculty and students has included the creation of thermodynamic models which predict how changes in operating conditions affect the energy efficiency of data center equipment and how the equipment can be improved to increase efficiency.  Additionally, the team has investigated how the heat coming of the servers can be captured and reused elsewhere in the system to reduce energy needs and improve overall system efficiency.\n\nThis research has led to numerous scientific insights with significant intellectual merit.
