 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports student travel to the NIST Micro-Robotics Challenge which involves advances in the design and fabrication of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) enabling the development of mobile micro-robots that can autonomously navigate and manipulate in controlled environments. It is expected that this technology will be critical in applications as varied as intelligent sensor networks, in vivo medical diagnosis and treatment, and adaptive microelectronics. Students explore micro-robot locomotion, power storage, embedded intelligence, and motion measurement. The NIST performance-based competitions for mobile micro-robots: 1) motivates researchers to accelerate micro-robot development, 2) reveals the most pressing technical challenges, and 3) evaluates the most successful methods for locomotion and manipulation at the micro-scale (e.g., actuation techniques for crawling).\r\n\r\nIn the competition research teams showcase working demonstrations that support the challenge themes of micro-scale actuation, manipulation and locomotion. This funding increases the competitiveness of US teams, as this event has traditionally been dominated by teams from Europe. The multi-day competitions are held during the IEEE ICRA conference providing an excellent opportunity to engage a broad technical audience. These are also be open to the general public to raise awareness of the state-of-the-art.  The competitions provide an opportunity for students and leaders to learn how micro-robotics can play an important role in society.",

International travel with functional equipment proved most challenging, but all teams handled logistics, funding and other travel arrangements very well.\n\nFor the 2011 competition, only 1 US team placed 2nd at the Mobility Challenge (Univ. of Hawaii). At the 2012 competition, however, US teams fared much better, with both CMU and UH placing in 1st and 2nd place at the two events. \n\nConclusion:\n\nThe Microrobotics Challenge has been established as the flagship annual event aimed at promoting research and education in microrobotics. Microrobotics education combines multiple engineering disciplines, such as MEMS, Microrobotics and Control at small scales, and numerous theoretical, as well as practical challenges remain to be addressed.\n\nThis project made it possible for 13 US-based students to travel and compete at the prestigious international competition in 2011 and 2012. US teams have increased their competitiveness as a result of this grant, by winning events in 2012 (for..."
