To understand the computational challenges facing computational biology in the next 5-8 years, the PI proposes to run a special session at the next RECOMB2012 (http://recomb2012.crg.cat/) focused on emerging areas. RECOMB is an international scientific conference bridging the computational, mathematical and biological sciences, and is an excellent forum for disseminating the latest developments in computational biology.",
