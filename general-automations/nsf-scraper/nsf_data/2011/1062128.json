 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF-REU Site in Extremal Graph Theory and Dynamical Systems at RIT will engage ten students in each of the summers 2011, 2012, and 2013 in a research experience in mathematics. The students will work directly with RIT faculty for the entirety of the program and will receive mentoring in mathematical research practices, as well as in written and oral communication. Research will be disseminated through publications in refereed journals, as well as in presentations at national and regional mathematical meetings, and at their home institutions. Students will be encouraged to pursue graduate studies and employment in the mathematical sciences. During the program students will participate in an Ethics in Science Workshop. The REU program will intersect with RIT's Summer Mathematics Institute where each of the REU students will present to nearly 100 mathematics and computer science high school teachers from New York State. \r\n\r\n    Our recruitment efforts will target students from universities, liberal arts colleges, and community colleges. We aim to have 80 percent of the participants from outside of the host institution, with an emphasis on drawing students from colleges without Ph.D. programs and extensive research opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
