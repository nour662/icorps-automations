 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Gangli Wang of Georgia State University. Prof. Wang and his students will synthesize and characterize the properties of gold and copper nanoclusters that are capped with multi-dentate thiols for chemical stabilization. The energetics of metal nanoclusters will be investigated with optical and electrochemical techniques. Nano-sized electrodes will be fabricated to quantitatively study the electron transfer kinetics in these nanoclusters. A correlation will be established between the energetics and functionality of metal nanoclusters and their compositions and structures. \r\n\r\nThe project will address basic questions and issues that are at the heart of many fields such as energy, nanoscience, surface science, and chemistry. The structure-property correlation established on gold and copper nanoclusters could potentially reveal the active sites in catalytic processes. The nanoclusters could also be used in photovoltaics devices. The proposed research will provide state-of-the-art education and training opportunities for students in this cutting edge, interdisciplinary research area.",
