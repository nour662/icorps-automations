The second part is for mathematics education researchers and psychometricians to have an in-depth discussion of applying advanced psychometric models to develop next generation, transformative assessments in mathematics that are valid and reliable.  This project is to provide much needed opportunities for the mathematics education research community to be aware of the advancement of the psychometric models and equip the new generation of the mathematics education researchers to use advanced psychometric models in their research.  Similarly, it will also provide opportunities for psychometricians to understand the nature of mathematics learning and understanding.",
