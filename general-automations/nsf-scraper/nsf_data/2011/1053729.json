The approach is focused on the capture and use of energy like solar thermal using small-scale devices. Microfabrication and system design contribute to excellent metrics for real-world implementation.  The system operates on a new thermodynamic working cycle, focused on operation at low temperatures associated with ambient thermal energy collection.  Research results in a new solar thermal collector, advanced heat exchangers, and a novel expander suitable for operation in many applications.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis research focuses on the use of highly available thermal energy sources that are largely unused today.  In addition, the approach represents a novel operating cycle dependant on phase change and resonant operation of the expander.  This is a first for this scale of application and thermal energy source.  Advanced fabrication techniques will result in research progress in areas with little prior work.  Finally, the research is well suited for application to other technologies like advanced thermoelectric generators.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis research engages a broad spectrum of underrepresented students and community via K-12 outreach and university student integration.  Underrepresented groups make up a high percentage of students in this outreach.  A new undergraduate energy course furthers outreach and impact.  Research results will be published in leading journals, conferences, and workshops.  These results also provide real-world examples for outreach activities.  This outreach significantly impacts energy education on multiple levels and encourages student involvement in advanced energy research.",
