The Project iLASER team will visit communities in Chula Vista, CA; El Centro/Brawley, CA; Yuma, AZ; Nogales, AZ; Las Cruces, NM; El Paso, TX; McAllen, TX; and Harlingen, TX. Each two-day or three-day visit will include activities in light and solar energy. Numerous local partners, including Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCAs, science museums, two year colleges, chemistry clubs and individuals will assist. Two particularly critical partners are the Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE Net) and CCI Solar, a basic research center centered at Caltech. Public lectures on the science and impacts of CCI Solar research will be offered in each community.\r\n\r\nProject iLASER is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Division of Research on Learning, Lifelong Learning Cluster, as part of the celebration of the International Year of Chemistry.",

Workshops offered during the summer of 2016, as part of two separate programs focused on teacher professional development (both pre-service and in-service K-12 STEM teachers), integrated units based on curriculum that was developed for Project iLASER. These two endeavors include a project supported by the NSF Advanced Technological Education program (NSF Award ID DUE 1400650) for community college students who are pre-service K-12 STEM teachers and a project supported by a grant from the NSF ..."
