 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  \"BRCC to LSU Engineering Pathway to Success\" S-STEM Program (Baton Rouge Community College (BRCC) to  Louisiana State University Baton Rouge Campus (LSU)) provides financial support for approximately 35 academically talented, financially needy students who have completed the Associate of Science in Engineering degree at BRCC and transfer into an engineering degree program within the College of Engineering at LSU. The specific discipline areas include nine engineering fields. The project is administered by the Office for Diversity Programs within LSU's College of Engineering, with collaboration from BRCC and oversight by an Advisory Panel.  The focus of the intellectual merit centers around the project providing a model for blending the elements of recruitment, retention, and placement into an integrated, comprehensive but non-intrusive program that promotes student success in transitioning from the community college to a large state university (LSU).  The broader impacts center around the project's focus on providing increased opportunities for a larger, more diverse population of students, non-traditional, underrepresented and first generation, to obtain a BS in engineering degree. Many students who attend BRCC do so for financial and/or requirement issues that prevent them from directly attending LSU as a freshman.",

It supported an engineering degree path with students earning a BRCC associate of science in engineering and completing a bachelor&rsquo;s of science engineering degree at LSU. Over five years, the program provided scholarships and academic/professional support to 36 students who demonstrated academic talent and financial need. The primary goals of the program were to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Utilize scholarships to create and sustain a pathway for BRCC transfer students.</li>\n<li>Develop a successful model for transfer students from community colleges and 4-year institutions based on the experiences and outcomes of the project.</li>\n<li>Lower financial hurdle for BRCC transfer students.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Pathway Scholarship project in collaboration with a companion NSF Science Talent Expansion Program had specific objectives supporting these goals. They were: (1) develop and maintain an effective liaison between BRCC and LSU; (2) utilize scholars in a peer ambassador program facilitating transfer success; (3) establish a pre-transfer academic counseling program; (4) expand existing seminars to orient and integrate BRCC and other transfer students into LSU and (5) invite BRCC math, science and engineering faculty to participate in ongoing Faculty Development.</p>\n<p>Activities of the program included outreach, professional development, advising, and developing an overall assessment tool.&nbsp; All scholars participated in outreach activities that consisted of Peer-to-Peer talks at BRCC each semester and Shadow Days at LSU for BRCC students. The Pathway scholars also were incorporated into the formalized LSU peer mentor training program and participated in Transfer Career Day for new transfer students. Advising for BRCC students was enhanced with the addition of a counselor who spent time at both campuses. Survey tools were created to gain a better understanding of the transfer students at key points of their academic career and to assess the program. The questionnaire was administered to students considering transferring to LSU and Pathway Scholars.</p>\n<p>Scholarships were awarded to four cohorts; Cohort 1- five students, Cohort 2 &ndash; seven students, Cohort 3 - twelve students, and Cohort 4 &ndash; twelve students. The eligibility and selection criteria included earning pre-engineering AS degree from BRCC with a 2.75 minimum cumulative GPA and financial need, and the selection committee included faculty and staff from both campuses. The overall persistence (i.e. retention and graduation) of Pathway Scholars in LSU engineering was 94% and the mean GPA was 3.09. &nbsp;All scholars from Cohort 1 graduated, and the mean GPA was 3.22. LSU engineering retention and graduation for Cohort 2 was 86%, and the mean GPA at graduation was 2.89. Cohort 3 students transferred to LSU fall 2013 and spring 2014, and the persistence was 100%. Cohort 3 had one continuing student scheduled to graduate spring 2018, and the graduates (n=11) had a mean GPA of 3.00.&nbsp; Cohort 4 students transferred to LSU fall 2014 and spring 2015, and the persistence was 92% after one scholar relocated. Cohort 4 had four continuing students as of fall 2017, and the graduates (n=7) had a mean GPA of 3.30. Results indicate that the Pathway scholars have a graduation rate that greatly exceeds the historical (2003-2009) 25% rate for BRCC transfers to LSU. Overall, the Pathway Scholar Program was rated very highly by the scholars, and the program delivered on its promise of supporting the students financially so they can focus more on their education, and connecting them with other students and professionals in their field.</p>\n<p><em>Broader Impacts.</em> The principal impact of the project was to provide increased opportunities for a more diverse population of students to obtain an engineering BS degree. Many students who attend BRCC do so for financial and/or requirement issues that prevent them from directly attending LSU. The 36 scholars were highly qualified,&nbsp;entering LSU with an average GPA of 3.37,&nbsp; and had financial need. They were more diverse with respect to race/ethnicity 17% Black/African American and 22% Asian (specifically Vietnamese). Three of the scholars were US Military veterans.</p>\n<p><em>Intellectual Merit.</em> The project provided a model for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Recruitment </em>to by developing a liaison relationship with the community college faculty in the pre-engineering, math and physics courses. The Peer-to Peer Talks by the Pathway scholars effectively demonstrated how community college student could succeed at LSU.</li>\n<li><em>Retention</em> by addressing the most difficult hurdle of financial resources and providing academic support including a session on &ldquo;How to Study Better&rdquo; created for the transfer student.</li>\n<li><em>Placement into an integrated program</em> that was comprehensive and promoted student success in transitioning from the community college to a large state university (LSU) though Shadow Days, the Transfer Career Day Workshop and other professional development activities. The transfer student counselor who held office hours for students at both BRCC and LSU campuses proved to be key in helping the students making the transition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/29/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sarah&nbsp;C&nbsp;Jones</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1060423/1060423_10073754_1506708715392_Slide15--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1060423/1060423_10073754_1506708715392_Slide15--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Persistence and Graduation Rates of Pathway Scholars\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1060423/1060423_10073754_1506708715392_Slide15--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Persistence and Graduation Rates of Pathway Scholars\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The scholarship program was highly effective in helping students stay enrolled and graduate with an LSU engineering degree.
