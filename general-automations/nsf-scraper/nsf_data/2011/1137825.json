The principal speaker will be Professor James Berger from Duke University. This award will support 29 participants at different stages of their careers. \r\n\r\nThe conference will address longstanding methodological challenges of statistical model uncertainty and multiplicity along with the recent developments in the area that have been driven by 21st century scientific applications such as complex models and large data sets.  The conference aims to attract new researchers to this field by providing a well-organized overview and also intends to strengthen links and collaborations between multiple groups of researchers in the western United States.",
