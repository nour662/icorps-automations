 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund a combined observational and theoretical study of luminous blue variables, which are massive stars experiencing strong mass loss and evolving to be red supergiants.  They are widely believed to the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae, but many of these may not explode if the mass lost during their lifetimes is high enough.  This team will conduct long-term observations of these variables in several nearby galaxies, in order to get an improved census of these objects, elucidate the mechanisms that may be responsible for giant eruptions, and to better understand the mechanism of mass loss and how stars evolve as they experience episodic (rather than steady) mass loss.\r\n\r\nModern supernova surveys are finding a number objects in nearby galaxies which are not true supernovae, the \"supernova impostors,\" which may be objects like eta Carinae that shed 10-20 times the mass of our Sun in a few years.  The final stages of these most massive stars are important for a valid picture of stellar astrophysics and they are increasingly significant in cosmology. They are the likely progenitors of Gamma Ray Bursters used as cosmological probes, and many of the first stars in the universe are thought to have been very massive.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIt has long been considered well-established that the most massive stars, more than 10 times the mass of the Sun, will end their brief lives as supernovae.  But, there is  growing evidence that this may not be the case for all of them.  Some may collapse directly to the back hole, but after they have already shed a lot of mass.  Many highly evolved massive stars that are approaching their final stages  have dramatic eruptions before their end state whether as a true supernova or as a black hole.
