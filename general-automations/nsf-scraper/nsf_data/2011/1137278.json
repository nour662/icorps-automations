The meeting format includes keynotes, workshops, expert panels, tutorials, and poster sessions in addition to the SCALE challenge competition. The 11th CCGrid conference (CCGrid 2011) will be held in May 2011 in Newport Beach, California, USA. \r\n\r\nStudents attending CCGrid 2011 will be exposed to discussions of major challenges in the field; have opportunities to interact and network with experts from academia and industry; have the opportunity to hear presentations from leaders in the field; and will take part in special student events. Student events will include interactive poster sessions and a student scholar roundtable with senior researchers. To ensure student participation at CCGrid the conference organizers will award travel scholarships to a number of graduate students.",
