 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Education Workshop (NEW) is a special professional development forum that convenes two- and four-year instructors, K-12 teachers, and industry to further Material Science and STEM education.  The three-day event reflects a K-20 integration model in the way it is organized, implemented and presented.  Each Workshop features an expert panel discussion and a facility tour of cutting edge manufacturing in action along with plenary talks and breakout sessions that feature hands-on teaching and learning.  The National Resource Center for Materials Technology Education (MatEd) housed at Edmonds Community College administers and implements expanded annual NEW events at three different strategically chosen host sites across the country that promote partnerships with K-20 educators, economic development organizations and key manufacturing industries that are critical to America's competitiveness.  Co-branding NEW with MatEd strategically advances the potential for sustainability for both entities resulting in better service to their national audience.  The workshops provide valuable opportunities for K-20 STEM teachers to broaden their perspectives and knowledge and expand their professional development venues.  MatEd supplies the materials education community with current, valuable aids for teaching and research, which can be used immediately in the classroom.  NEW has significant benefits and impact in terms of career awareness for students, technical upskilling for faculty, and the sharing of successful practices in pedagogy.  The evaluation measures the effectiveness of the workshops to meet the goals set.",
