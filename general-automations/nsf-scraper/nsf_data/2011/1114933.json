Thirty-five states have adopted the CCSS in mathematics, and there is a need to help teachers and the public learn about the standards and how to use them to increase mathematics learning.  The project is convening a meeting of experts to recommend how to design, implement, and assess large-scale professional development systems that have the potential to reform mathematics instruction. A final report with recommendations and reactions from professional organizations will be disseminated through the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe work of the project is assisted by the following organizations: Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators, Mathematics Association of America, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics, and the Association of State Supervisors of Mathematics.",

Its goal was to impact professional development practice by generating recommendation for scaling up professional development that supported the implementation of the CCSSM.\n            Project PIs organized and facilitated collaborative work among approximately 40 experts from different fields of research (mathematics, professional development, equity, assessment, policy, and system research, as well as \"high leverage\" practitioners). The experts were selected because of the contributions their special knowledge within their fields could make to mathematics teacher professional development at scale. PIs and experts generated a critical and timely set of documents to address the nation-wide problem of needing to provide high quality mathematics professional development at scale to support the implementation of the CCSSM.\n            The main result of this project is a set of nine recommendations for creating, sustaining, and assessing professional development systems for practicing mathematics teachers to support the implementation of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM), which could be used in the design and implementation of large-scale professional development systems for all teachers who are being asked to put the CCSSM into practice. These nine recommendations are:\n\nEmphasize the Substance of CCSSM-PD: Professional development provides opportunities for practicing mathematics teachers to engage with both the CCSSM content and the CCSSM practices in a focused and integrated way. \nCreate and Adapt Materials for Use in CCSSM-PD: Professional Development materials are needed that explicitly address the mathematics content and practices of the CCSSM and provide vivid images of teaching and learning that are consistent with CCSSM. \nDesign CCSSM-PD Based on Features that Support Teacher Learning: Professional development takes into account existing knowledge about effective ways to organize learning experiences for teachers of mathematics. \nBuild Coherent Programs of CCSSM-PD: Programs of professional development provide a continuous and coherent set of experiences in which practicing mathematics teachers engage over an extended period of time. \nPrepare and Use Knowledgeable Facilitators for CCSSM-PD: Professional development uses expert facilitation to ensure teacher learning of CCSSM at scale. \nProvide CCSSM-PD Tailored to Key Role Groups, in Addition to Teachers: Strong programs of professional development target a variety of role groups within the education system and attend to the professional needs of each group as the system builds capacity at all levels.\nEducate Stakeholders about the CCSSM: Members of the general public need to be apprised on how the CCSSM will impact instruction and learning in our nation\u00c6s classrooms.\nContinuously Assess CCSSM-PD: Professional development programs are regularly assessed to provide formative information for program improvement and revision and to establish the effectiveness of the programs.\nCreate CCSSM-PD Consortia: Professional development consortia are needed to oversee and improve the role professional development plays in successful implementation of the    CCSSM.\n\n            These recommendations emphasize that attending to the professional development of practicing mathematics teachers in light of the CCSSM is a requirement for the successful implementation of the new standards. They summarize knowledge in the field and also indicate important next steps for practitioners. The recommendations can help districts and states in creating, sustaining, and assessing professional development systems for practicing mathematics teachers that support their implementation of the CCSSM,..."
