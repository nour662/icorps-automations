 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changes to the environment including contamination are major threats to animal diversity and human wellbeing.  Cap 'n' collar transcription factors (CNCs) are master regulators of genes that protect animals from environmental stress.  Understanding and predicting how animals and humans respond to environmental stress will require a detailed understanding of CNC regulation and function.  The genetic model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has numerous experimental advantages for studying these processes.  C. elegans is also a model for understanding the biology of nematodes, which as parasites damage $80 billion of crops per year, burden animal husbandry, and infect as many as 1/3 of humans world-wide.\r\nC. elegans has a single CNC named SKN-1.  The objectives of this project are to 1) define how SKN-1 is regulated during environmental stress by combining protein biochemistry with transgenic experiments in live animals and 2) use genetics and molecular biology to identify and characterize genes that function with SKN-1.  This new knowledge will facilitate a deeper understanding of how animals acclimate and adapt to challenging environments and will provide a foundation for understanding nematode defenses to anti-parasitic drugs and host-immune responses.\r\nThis project will educate and train students, teachers, and scientists at the pre-collegiate, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral levels.  New concepts and ideas will be translated to ~225 largely pre-medical, dental, veterinary, and doctoral students through a stress biology module in an intensive upper level undergraduate course.  Outreach programs will introduce primary school students to nematodes and a training module will introduce high-school teachers to C. elegans as a genetic and molecular model system for education, animal biology, biotechnology, and biomedical research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow do cells know when there is a harmful condition in their environment and how do they turn on specific genes for repair and protection?  These are complex questions that have important implications on diverse problems in ecology, toxicology, aging, drug resistance, and chronic disease. Every animal and human cell has thousands of genes involved in maintaining an internal environment that is compatible with life.  The underlying principles and strategies for solving this problem are similar across the spectrum of life allowing us to gain foundational insights from simple model species.  We used a tiny nematode worm named C. elegans as a simple, inexpensive, and easily manipulated model of these complex problems.  C. elegans are small enough to rest on a pin head and only have 959 cells, but they have many organ systems and share as many as 40% of their genes with humans. \n\nIn this project, we studied regulation and function of a protein named SKN-1.  You can think of SKN-1 as a fire chief in charge of managing when and how a fire department responds to fires, accidents, health issues, or even cats stuck in trees.  In the case of cells, SKN-1 manages responses to poisons, oxidants, and metabolic imbalances to promote health and longevity.  All animals have a version of a fire chief like SKN-1, and understanding how they make their decisions is an essential starting point for efforts to monitor and improve animal and human health and agriculture.  Using genetic and molecular tools in C. elegans, we discovered that SKN-1 does not normally manage responses on its own.  SKN-1 consults directly with another protein named WDR-23 that acts like an accountant making sure that responses adhere to a budget.  We showed that without WDR-23, SKN-1 orders robust responses even when they are not needed.  Although this increases cell resilience and longevity, it comes at the cost of growth and reproduction.  Without consultation from WDR-23, it is as if the SKN-1 becomes overeager and orders preemptive responses that drain resources away from other critical functions.  We also discovered that WDR-23 works within a committee that includes two other proteins, SKR-1 and XREP-1.  These other two proteins function to give WDR-23 information about what resource levels are appropriate for each incident.\n\nThese new insights tell us that the benefits of increasing vigilance against cell damage must be carefully considered in relation to the costs.  This means that organisms in the wild could suffer reduced growth and reproduction even during mild environmental challenges that elicit repair responses.  Furthermore, identification of the core team of advisors lays the foundation for efforts to therapeutically enhance the pathway to protect cells and tissues from aging and environmental stress.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/16/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Keith P Choe"
