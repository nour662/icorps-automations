 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through participation in the National Weather Center Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, fifty undergraduate students over a five-year period will participate in a unique career exploration experience.  Each student will collaborate with scientists to conduct research and live the life of a scientist through: attending lectures, participating in workshops to build skills and knowledge relevant to the job, learning and practicing a variety of research methods, and presenting their research in both written and oral formats.  Recruitment will seek a wide range of competitive applications from undergraduate students who are capable, but have not had an opportunity to participate in research. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  Participants will contribute knowledge and understanding in basic science as well as applied research.  Past research results have been used for training, emergency management operations, and risk planning.  This program has matured sufficiently that recent participants have produced about five conference presentations and 1-2 formal scientific publications each year.  This REU program has proven to effectively nurture the next generation of scientists.  A combination of individual and entrepreneurial team activities serve to build participants' metacognitive research skills and prepare them for changing career opportunities.  This REU site contributes to NSF's goal to create an internationally competitive, globally engaged public, private, and academic scientific workforce. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Past participants report experiencing scientific discovery while learning skills they report as invaluable to later graduate school and career experiences.  The scientific workforce is more diverse because of this program, with 60 percent of prior participants being female and 10-20 percent members of racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in atmospheric sciences.  Finally, this program serves to increase collaboration among the academic, public and private sectors.",

We brought in a total of 54 undergraduate students over the five summers and had them try their hand at conducting a research project under mentorship of our scientists and operational meteorologists. These 54 project reports are all available on our web site:&nbsp;http://www.caps.ou.edu/reu/</p>\n<p>These projects ranged across a wide variety of topics. Several explored how to improve weather forecast model predictions of severe and hazardous weather, including heavy rainfall in California, the development of severe weather in supercell thunderstorms, and waves in the jet stream that impact development of large weather systems. Other studies looked at improving predictions of what type of winter weather will occur (freezing rain, ice pellets, or snow), and whether blizzard conditions would develop.</p>\n<p>Many projects studied weather radars, both the radars currently being used for severe weather detection and the experimental radars still in development. For example, data from an experimental mobile radar was used to study how a tornado formed and dissipated, and another study used both experimental and operational radars to compare how well they estimated winds at the ground (radars only measure winds aloft).</p>\n<p>A few projects used lightning or satellite data to study topics ranging from the accuracy of lightning detection networks to use of satellite data to measure rainfall in areas of the world that do not have good weather radar networks.</p>\n<p>Other projects studied movement of severe storms and how that can be better predicted ahead of time. A GIS study compared the 1974 and 2011 tornado outbreaks, finding that despite the high number of fatalities in 2011 that the warning system is better than it was in 1974. A handful of social science projects looked at how data impacts forecasters' confidence, what people know about how to lessen tornado damage through simple construction techniques, and whether people were using any of those techniques when rebuilding after recent devastating tornadoes in central Oklahoma.</p>\n<p>These projects were all done in just 10 weeks, so certainly there is much more to discover on these topics.
