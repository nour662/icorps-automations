 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent proliferation of datasets makes it difficult for individual scientists to know which are most appropriate for specific applications, including evaluation and analysis of increasingly complex and comprehensive Earth System Models (ESMs). The World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modeling has led to new demands for observational assessments and dataset availability for evaluating the forthcoming Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model runs. \r\n\r\nThis project will establish and maintain a web-based Informed Guide to selected climate data sets of relevance to the evaluation of ESMs. The two main objectives are: 1) to evaluate and assess selected climate datasets, and 2) to provide \"expert-user\" guidance and advice on the utility and limitations of selected climate data sets. Each component of the earth system will be addressed, including the atmosphere, ocean, land, cryosphere, and biosphere.\r\n\r\nBroader Significance\r\nThe Informed Guide is intended to serve as a community resource through broad participation by university and other climate researchers worldwide. The interactive website is expected to enhance the ability of researchers and students to understand data limitations and effectively utilize data in their research. The project will facilitate and enhance access to relevant climate data archives for diagnostic analyses and evaluation of ESMs from a system perspective, including those models participating in the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and CMIP5 activities.",

Observations of key variables in the climate system--for example surface temperature, precipitation, clouds, sea ice, winds, ocean currents, and trace gases--form the bedrock upon which understanding the climate system is built.  Observations are vital to the development and validation of the climate models (now commonly called Earth System Models, or ESMs) used to project climate change and its impacts on society.  As the climate research community has benefitted from an ever-increasing quantity and variety of observations, especially from satellites, the complexity and nuances of individual datasets has also grown.  There are multiple versions of datasets on a single variable, all legitimate but generated with a different algorithm, quality control, error adjustments, and data processing and analysis.  This proliferation of datasets has made it difficult for individual scientists to know which are most appropriate for specific applications, including the evaluation and analysis of ESMs.  Beyond the climate research community, an increasing number of economic sectors, for example energy, agriculture, insurance, and defense, require high-quality climate data and knowledge to inform major decisions.  \n\n \nThe distinguishing feature of the Climate Data Guide is expert-user commentary on the strengths and limitations of individual data sets from the researchers who construct and evaluate the data.
