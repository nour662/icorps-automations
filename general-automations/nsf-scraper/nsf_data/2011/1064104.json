In 2011 the topic of the summer school will be \"Waves and Imaging.\" The funds would be used to cover transportation, lodging, and meals for participating graduate students from institutions in the United States. The goal of the 2011 G2S3 is to offer four accessible mini-courses on the mathematical background of tomographic imaging, recent research developments, and applications to important industrial problems. The proposed topics are not normally found in doctoral courses: they represent a recent convergence of mathematical notions and interdisciplinary advances that has yet to appear in textbook format. The lecturers and the topics are as follows: Margaret Cheney, RPI, Foundations of scattering, Radar Imaging; Frank Natterer, U Muenster, Computerized Tomography, Medical Imaging; Laurent Demanet, MIT, Seismic Imaging, Compressed Sensing; Josselin Garnier, Paris VII, Imaging in Random Media, Time Reversal, Passive Imaging.\r\n \r\nThe topic of the summer school--tomography--is the essential concept under the hood of such imaging modalities as CT scans in medicine; synthetic aperture radar for defense applications; and seismic imaging for the oil and gas industry.  The acquisition hardware and the datasets are evolving fast, but our ability to perform tomography is not. The summer school aims to interest a new generation of graduate students with quantitative backgrounds in the significant computational challenges associated with tomography. NSF support for US-based participants would have a positive impact on the continued strong competitiveness of the US in this important field of mathematical engineering with major industrial and defense applications.",
