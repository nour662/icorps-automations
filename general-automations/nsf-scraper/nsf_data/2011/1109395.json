 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation evaluates the relative importance different physical processes during molecular cloud and star formation. Overall, this improves our understanding of the dynamics of molecular cloud formation and of how external flows and internal massive star formation act to disperse or destroy them again. It tests whether star formation rates are governed by molecular cloud formation due to high pressure in a disk's mid-plane, or by gravitational instability of the combination of gas and stars. Related problems are the lifetimes and star formation efficiency in molecular clouds. \r\nDr. Mac Low and his team use the FLASH adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulation code that can handle the modeling of the most important physical processes important to star formation models. These include effects of supernova explosions; self gravity; differential rotation in the shearing sheet approximation; ionizing, dissociating, and non-ionizing but heating radiation from point sources; magnetic fields; molecular chemistry in two different levels of approximation; an approximation to radiative cooling in optically thin and thick regions; a fixed stellar gravitational potential to maintain vertical stratification; the full galactic fountain; and sink particles emitting both radiation and stellar jets and winds. The models are done so that effects are integrated into a multiscale model of star formation covering scales ranging from 0.5 kiloparsec down to 100 Astronomical Units. The results help to distinguish between the \"high midplane pressure\" and the \"gravitational instability\" models. Thus, self-consistent numerical models follow the assembly of giant molecular clouds and the results of star formation within them. The team evaluates the relative importance of these processes by parameter studies using the fully resolved version of these models with full chemistry.\r\nThis research program is an international collaboration between the Museum and the Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics of the University of Heidelberg. It will also support the training of a graduate student. Results from this research are also incorporated into the exhibition and education program of the American Museum of Natural History, including the Hayden Planetarium.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this grant is to understand what processes determine how stars form in galaxies including our own Milky Way Galaxy.  Observations show that newly born stars are always found in dense structures of molecular hydrogen and dust known as molecular clouds.  This grant supported the development of computational simulations of the gas pervading galaxies to understand how these molecular clouds form.  Competing physical effects act on the gas.  These include the gravity of the gas itself, as well as the gravity of the already present stars and dark matter; supernova explosions that can compress gas into clouds, stir them to prevent gravitational collapse, or tear them apart; ultraviolet radiation that heats the gas and dissociates molecules; cooling of the gas that can allow it to compress; and magnetic fields that resist compression.  Each of these processes is modeled in the simulations that were developed with support from this grant.  The main question to be answered was whether molecular clouds slowly form stars for a long time, or quickly form stars that then destroy the clouds.\n\nThe simulations were checked by confirming that they predict how the density of different forms of gas drops with distance away from the midplane of the Galactic disk; that they indeed show the formation of dense clouds of gas as expected; and that the distribution of gas temperatures agrees with observations.  Examining the dynamics of the clouds revealed that none of the processes resisting gravity, including magnetic fields, stirring by supernovas, or heating by ultraviolet light, were effective in reducing the speed with which they collapsed and formed stars.  Instead the clouds collapsed quickly, allowing stars to form that can subsequently destroy the clouds effectively.  This result offers strong support to the hypothesis that molecular clouds are dynamic objects that are quickly assembled, begin forming stars, and then are just as quickly torn apart by the energetic feedback from those stars.\n\nNSF support of the PI enables broader impacts from his curatorial work in exhibition and education with the American Museum of Natural History, which reaches millions of people in New York, and millions more across the nation and the world through: planetarium shows such as \"Passport to the Universe,\" \"Journey to the Stars,\" and \"Dark Universe\" that are shown locally and licensed widely (and also in the last case converted to 3D IMAX for further distribution); providing material to Science Bulletins shown in the Museum and distributed on YouTube to audiences of 30-50K for videos with the PI; teaching classes to pre-service teachers in the Museum?s Master of Arts in Teaching degree program; teaching undergraduate computational astrophysics to Columbia University students; training Museum volunteers to explain the astrophysics exhibits; and providing commentary and insight to the media.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/11/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mordecai-Mark Mac Low"
