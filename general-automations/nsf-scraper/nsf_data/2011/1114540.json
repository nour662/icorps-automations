The request includes one item:\r\n1)\t12 KHz Transducer\r\nFunds are requested for acquisition of a replacement 12 KHz Transducer. The existing transducer failed and is no longer operational.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\tThe principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

Project Activities and Findings:\n\na)  Research \n\nOceanographic Instrumentation awards for the R/V Atlantic Explorer support scientific research and technology development that improves scientific knowledge of societal relevant environmental issues.\n\nMany of the major research projects that use the R/V Atlantic Explorer are oceanographic time-series efforts (http://www.bios.edu/research/time_series.html; Figure 1).
