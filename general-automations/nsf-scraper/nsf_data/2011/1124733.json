 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: This project is awarded under the Nanoelectronics for 2020 and Beyond competition, with support by multiple Directorates and Divisions at the National Science Foundation as well as by the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative of the Semiconductor Research Corporation. Continuing evolution of electronics beyond the limits of the conventional silicon technology requires innovative approaches for solving the heat dissipation, speed and scaling issues. Alternative state variables other than dissipative charge transfer hold promise for drastic improvements in computational power. Collective states of magnetization, spin waves, and exciton condensates are being considered, but, to date, the performance results are modest. This project proposes a revolutionary new approach for the collective states that carry electrical signals, do not require magnetic fields, and can be realized at room temperature. The alternative state variables will be implemented with charge-density waves. The charge-density wave effects have been known for decades but never considered for information processing. The intellectual merit of this project includes better understanding of the material properties and physical processes of charge-density wave materials in highly-scaled, low-dimension regimes that have not yet been explored. The results of the project will lead to optimized device designs for exploiting charge-density waves and accurate understanding of the fundamental limits of the performance metrics. The intellectual merit also includes performance evaluation of the low-noise topological insulator interconnects proposed as part of new architectures. The project will result in new knowledge of the properties of the charge-density wave materials obtained with the help of optical microscopy, atomic-force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and other techniques. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed project will lead to a revolutionary new technology for replacing or complementing conventional silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. The phase, frequency and amplitude of the collective current of the interfering charge waves will encode information and allow for massive parallelism in information processing. The possibility of using the phase for logic operations allows one to minimize the required number of elements per circuit, reduce the power consumption, and ease the scaling requirement. The charge-density wave devices will be implemented with an alternative growth technique ? electrochemical atomic layer deposition ? with demonstrated potential for synthesis of crystalline atomically-thin layers of pertinent materials. The technique will allow the research team to experiment with new chemistries and heterogeneous integration of a variety of charge-density wave materials. The low-dissipation, massively parallel information processing with the collective state variables can satisfy the computational, communication, and sensor technology requirements for decades to come. The successful project will (i) improve the economic competitiveness of the United States; (ii) contribute to national security; and (iii) increase participation of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering. The project will result in improved student education and training at the University of California ? Riverside, a minority serving institution with a large Hispanic student population. The broader impact includes contributions to the development of a synergetic interdisciplinary Materials Science and Education program, as well as contributions to graduate and undergraduate training focused on materials synthesis, at the University of Georgia.",

Alternative state variables, other than dissipative charge transfer, hold promise for drastic improvements in computational power. The main goal of this project was to demonstrate electronic devices with functionalities based on the charge density waves that act as collective states. The charge-density-wave phase is a macroscopic quantum state consisting of a periodic modulation of the electronic charge density accompanied by a periodic distortion of the atomic lattice in certain metallic crystals. To achieve this goal, the interdisciplinary team of experts (i) fabricated prototype charge density wave devices; (ii) performed computational optimization of the materials systems and device structures; and (iii) investigated electrochemical atomic layer deposition as an alternative technique for synthesis of thin films required for device fabrication. The project led to a breakthrough demonstration of the room temperature current switching driven by a voltage controlled phase transition between two charge-density-wave states in sub-10 nm films of 1T-polytype of tantalum disulfide semi-metal. The abrupt change in the current accompanied by hysteresis was used to built the first charge-density-wave voltage controlled oscillator operating at room temperature as reported in Nature Nanotechnology (2016). The demonstrated devices can be used for information processing, e.g. in oscillatory neural networks. The intellectual merits of the project also include better understanding of the material properties and physical processes in two-dimensional charge-density-wave materials; progress in charge-density-wave device fabrication, and in atomic layer deposition of transition metal dichalcogenides. The two-dimensional charge-density-wave materials have been comprehensively characterization by optical microscopy, atomic-force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and other techniques, resulting in a wealth of new information pertinent to this important class of materials. The implemented transformative concept was the use of charge-density-wave effects for oscillator device operation at room temperature. The broader impacts of the project include a possible new technology for the low-dissipation information processing and communications. This project provided educational opportunities for several PhD students. One PhD student became an expert in the electrochemical atomic layer deposition while several others obtained training in Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy at the University of Georgia. Several PhD graduate students have been trained on advanced concepts and techniques in ab-initio calculations at the UC Riverside. One of them continued his academic career as a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Barbara. Four PhD graduate students have been trained for cleanroom nanoscale device fabrication. One student, involved in this project, completed his PhD and accepted employment with Intel Corporation, Portland.
