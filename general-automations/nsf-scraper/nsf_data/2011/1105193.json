 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three rather ambitious projects are proposed in the area of geometric\r\ngroup theory. The first is inspired by Zlil Sela's geometric solution\r\nof Tarski's logic problem. The PI and Mladen Bestvina plan to complete\r\ntheir program to solve by geometric means two forty-year-old problems\r\nof Mal'cev. They also propose to generalize their methods and provide\r\nan alternate proof to the Tarski problem. The second project, joint\r\nwith Michael Handel, is to solve the conjugacy problem for the outer\r\nautomorphism group Out(F) of a free group F. Much of the research in\r\nthis area is driven by the similarities between linear groups, surface\r\nmapping class groups, and Out(F). The conjugacy problem has been\r\nsolved for these other two classes. The final project, again joint\r\nwith Mladen Bestvina, is to better understand the geometry of outer\r\nautomorphism groups of free groups. In particular, it is proposed to show\r\nthat a complex analogous to the curve complex in the mapping class\r\ngroup setting is word hyperbolic.\r\n\r\nThree projects are proposed in the area of geometric group\r\ntheory. Geometric group theory is a relatively young branch of\r\nmathematics in which problems from other areas of mathematics are\r\nreformulated and then solved in geometric terms. This approach has\r\nbeen successful in areas that are sometimes viewed as distant from\r\ngeometry. For example, Zlil Sela used geometric methods to solve an\r\nold logic problem of Tarski. Inspired by Sela's methods, the PI and\r\nMladen Bestvina propose to solve two old logic problems of\r\nMal'cev. Group theory is another area where these methods have been\r\nparticularly successful. Groups are ubiquitous in math and the\r\nsciences. The set of symmetries of a molecule is an example. There is\r\nan important class of groups called \"free groups\" from which all other\r\ngroups can be constructed. The set of symmetries of a free group F is\r\nanother important group, denoted Out(F), which has been the subject of\r\nmuch current interest. The PI proposes two other projects focusing on\r\nOut(F). In one, he and Michael Handel propose to solve an old and\r\nfundamental problem on Out(F), namely that its conjugacy problem is\r\nsolvable. In the other project, the PI and Bestvina propose to better\r\nunderstand the intrinsic geometry of Out(F).",
