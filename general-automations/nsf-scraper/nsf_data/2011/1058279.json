 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop an antimicrobial polymer technology with silver compounded into the catheter matrix, which allows for antimicrobial action expected to last several months.  This cost-effective antimicrobial polymer technology prevents the formation of surface biofilms on long-term implantable devices, without generating bacterial resistance.  The root cause of these infections is the bacterial colonization of the catheter, with the likelihood of infection increasing as a function of catheter implantation time.  Currently, there are no low-cost, long-term antimicrobial catheters, thus the proposed technology would fill a much needed clinical demand.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project addresses the 280,000 catheter-related bloodstream infections in the U.S. that cost over $3 billion per year in excess healthcare costs, claiming 80,000 deaths.   The proposed technology will help clinicians attain and sustain zero indwelling catheter bloodstream infections.  The $1.2 billion implantable device market urgently needs inherently antimicrobial catheters, thus obviating the need for systemic antibiotic treatment.  Since no expensive coating procedures have to be performed, it will lead to cost effective manufacturing.  This should lead to rapid commercialization of a family of antimicrobial catheters, especially since these advanced catheters will significantly help to reduce outcome costs.",
