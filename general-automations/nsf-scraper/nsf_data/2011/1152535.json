 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI is a prominent  geologist at MIT who has spent more than 25 years studying and mapping the Eastern Tibetan Plateau.  Much of this work has been funded by the Continental Dynamics Program.  The results of this body of work form the basis of a book about to be published, ?Tectonics of the SE and E Tibetan Plateau and Its Foreland?.  It is the first such summary of the geology of this region with a major new synthesis for its evolution.  This work will serve as a basic framework for tectonic research in this part of China as well as SE Asia in general.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide support to complete the plates for the maps that are an essential component of the book.  The plates are unique in that they are a digital and layered presentation in two basic formats that can be fully manipulated by the reader.  Such a presentation may represent  impetus for other Earth scientists to publish maps in this format, which may represent the future style for publication of geological materials.",
