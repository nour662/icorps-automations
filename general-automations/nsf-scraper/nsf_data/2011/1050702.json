 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to study dynamics in RNA by applying innovative magnetic resonance methods of solid and solution state NMR. The central hypothesis underlying this project is that motion is an essential aspect of RNA function: therefore, understanding the biological function of nucleic acids requires knowledge of the degree to which motions modulate molecular recognition by proteins and small molecules. By understanding its motions, the project will further understanding of the molecular recognition principles. \r\n \r\nThe new tools to study functional dynamics in nucleic acids developed through this project will be broadly applicable to other nucleic acid systems. Because the project is highly interdisciplinary, spanning biophysics, chemistry, molecular biology and pharmacology, it provides many opportunities for scientific collaborations and for exposing undergraduate and graduate students to interdisciplinary research, and for the training of under-represented minority students.",
