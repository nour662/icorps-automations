 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abandoned agricultural land in the Eastern United States returns to forest in a well-established pattern in which \"old fields\" of herbs and grasses gradually give way to trees.  This field-to-forest transition is a key event in ecosystem development because it drives wildlife abundance, influences how ecosystems store carbon and cycle nutrients, and often changes the balance between landscapes dominated by alien or native plant species.  One puzzling aspect of this process is that old fields can persist for decades in the Northeast, but tend to transition to forests in less than 10 years in the Southeast, despite having many of the \"field invading\" tree species in common.  Is this due to the warmer climate of the Southeast, where trees can grow more quickly in competition with herbs and grasses?  If so, will \"old fields\" become forests more quickly as the climate warms?  Alternatively, the regions may be different in other ways (e.g. soil quality). In this project the PIs have designed an experiment to definitively answer this question, using a network of six field experiments from New York to Florida.  At each site, researchers will control the composition of the old field plants and invading trees (using species common to both the North- and Southeast), as well as varying the soil conditions to approximate northern and southern soils.  Researchers will monitor the rate at which trees invade each experimental community, and use the results to formulate a model that can make predictions about how climate, soil fertility, and characteristics of particular species influence the rate of forest development in the Eastern United States.\r\n\r\nThese results will be key for understanding how agricultural landscapes of the Eastern United States will continue to change over the next century, and will inform stakeholders on land management issues with respect to carbon sequestration, biological diversity, and other ecosystem services.  Two graduate students and several undergraduates will be trained, through the support of two junior faculty.  The project also includes use of several core ecological research facilities in the Eastern United States.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhen agricultural fields are abandoned, they grow back to forests through the process known as ecological succession.  This transition from field to forest controls many important ecological features, particularly the rate at which a site will absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Previous research by the PIs had demonstrated that in the northeastern US, forests grow back very slowly (greater than 60 years) while in the southeast this transition can occur in as little as 10-15 years.  This project was designed to investigate several hypotheses explaining this pattern: the temperature hypothesis proposed that trees grow more quickly in the south due to warmer tempertatures or longer growning seasons, the soil fertility hypothesis proposed that trees grew more slowly on the fertile, formerly glaciated soils of the northeast due to greater competition with early successional grasses and flowering plants (herbaceous plants), and the species identity hypothesis proposed that northern trees are inherently more slow growing than southern trees or that northern herbaceous species are more competitve .  These hypotheses were tested in a large scale experimental network across six sites from Syracuse NY in the north to Tallahassee FL in the south.  At each site, tree seeds from four species were added to experimental plots that varied in their soil fertility and the types of herbaceous plants with which the trees would be competing.  The primary finding of the experiment was strikingly strong support for the climate hypothesis - all tree species grew more quickly in more southern sites, due to both the direct effect of temperature on growth and because of reduced performance of the herbaceous species the trees were competing with.  \n\n \n\nThese results have exciting implications for global change research.  If succession speeds up as temperature increase in northern latitudes, it could potentially lead to greater rates of carbon capture by the rapidly growing trees.  If this occurs it would act as at least a partial check on future warming due to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.  In addition to this findings, funding from the grant has served to directly train a PhD student as well as over 15 undergraduates.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Justin P Wright"
