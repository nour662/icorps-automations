 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, \"NUE: Nano Science And Laboratory Experience (ScALE) at UMaine\", at the University of Maine, under the direction of Dr. Rosemary L. Smith, aims to introduce the basic concepts, applications, and implications of nanoscale science and engineering to all first-year engineering students at the University of Maine (UMaine). The proposed approach is to add nanoscience and nanoscale engineering content to the required 'introduction to' engineering courses offered by each engineering department. This content will be designed, developed and delivered as a 'drop-in' module, in collaboration with the instructors for each department's course. This project further aims to enhance undergraduate education and training in nanoscale science and engineering by establishing a college-wide minor in Nanotechnology, developing an upper level course in nanoscience, and to broaden participation of 1st and 2nd year students from underrepresented groups in nanoscale research.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include improved student recruitment, retention, and future workforce preparation achieved through the intentional integration of research and education at the undergraduate level, professional development of Maine's middle-school science teachers, the facilitation of new research and education collaborations among UMaine faculty with interests in nanoscale science and engineering, and the sharing of state-of-the-art instructional tools such as laboratory facilities and materials.  Outreach activities will focus on increasing the interest of female students in engineering careers by developing mini-projects for high school students targeting nanotechnology applications to biomedicine and energy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this project were a) to introduce nanoscale concepts to all first year engineering students at the University of Maine, through presentations, demonstrations and laboratory experiences, b) to enhance the participation of engineering undergraduates at UMaine in nanoscale research activities, c) to develop and offer a new, upper division course and d) to introduce a new minor in Nanotechnology.   All of these goals were achieved. First year engineering majors were engaged in tutorials and lab exercises introducing nanotechnology concepts and examples through the addition of nano-related content to the required curriculum.  The interest in nanotechnology was peaked in more than two dozen first year undergraduate students who went on to participate in nanotechnology research with six faculty, in engineering and science disciplines.  Many of the students who participated in research as undergraduates have gone on to graduate studies.  A new minor in Nanotechnology was created and approved by the University of Maine in 2013 which requires both coursework and participation in research for its completion.  Within one year, ten engineering undergraduate students have enrolled in the minor and three are expected to complete it upon their graduation in May 2015.  A new upper division course, entitled Nanoscience, was established, which is offered to both engineering and science majors as an interdisciplinary technical elective.  Multiple outreach activities were developed and delivered, broadening the impact of the project to include students in K-12 grades, and the general public.  As a result of this project, hundreds of K-12 students, teachers, 4H members, Girl Scouts and after school science clubs have participated in class room education, demonstrations, tours and hands on activities designed to inform the general public about nanotechnology.   In summary, the project has been successful in meeting its primary goal of introducing nanotechnology to all engineering undergraduate students and  increasing the number of engineering undergraduates who participate in nanotechnology research at UMaine.  UMaine engineering students are now engaged in the learning and practice of nanotechnology throughout their undergraduate career.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rosemary L Smith"
