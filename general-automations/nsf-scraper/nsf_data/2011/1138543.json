October 10?14, 2011.\r\n\r\nPACT seeks to increase student participation in conference and the field. The proposed funding would support the travel of eligible US students to the conference. Recipients would be able to attend the main conference, workshops, and tutorials. Travel grants will encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort will be made to reach out to women and under-represented minorities.",
