 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: This CAREER project aims to address the output power limitation of existing photomixers by investigating a new generation of plasmonic distributed Ge photomixers pumped at telecom wavelengths. By tackling the major obstacle of thermal breakdown of conventional photomixers, the proposed technology is expected to offer terahertz power levels that are orders of magnitude higher than is currently available from existing technologies.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: In this research plan, the PI will investigate, for the first time, the use of Ge as a promising candidate to tackle the thermal breakdown problem of photomixers. The PI also aims to investigate the use of distributed plasmonic contact electrodes to further improve the quantum efficiency of Ge photomixers. Plasmonic electrodes are expected to significantly enhance the pump coupling efficiency, while enabling ultra-high-speed collection of photo-generated carriers. Moreover, distributed photomixer architectures mitigate the non-ideal effects associated with the high intensity optical pumps, such as the carrier screening effect and excessive heating.\r\n\r\nBroad Impacts: Promising application of the terahertz source is in development of high-performance terahertz imaging and spectrometry systems. The educational component of this CAREER program intends to integrate education with research activities in the emerging field of terahertz technology. New graduate courses will be developed and undergraduates will be exposed to basic terahertz concepts through teaching modules, summer programs and senior design projects. Efforts in outreach, K12 activities, recruitment and retention of women, and under-represented minorities, will increase the supply of terahertz engineers and scientists, and further broaden the influence of the program.",
