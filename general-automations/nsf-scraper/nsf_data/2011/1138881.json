 "awd_abstract_narration": "To be able to build on the best of its Collaborative Research Networks, the IAI has asked investigators of its current CRN2 (GEO-0452325) and Small Grants Program-Human Dimensions (GEO-0642841) to submit proposals to advance the best science, most promising research initiatives, and to support the most innovative cross-disciplinary teams. The current proposal seeks funding for research to be conducted as sub-awards under that call. Outstanding proposals have been selected through review and panel evaluation by the IAI?s Scientific Advisory Committee. Of the current 21 CRN & SGP-HD projects, 13 submitted proposals, of which 9 were selected for possible funding.\r\n\r\nThe proposed program has a broader impact beyond its research though integration with decision makers from IAI member countries, through facilitating stakeholder participation in the science, and through the consolidation of international science collaboration networks and institutional links. Multidisciplinary participation in each project, particularly between the natural and human sciences not only enriches the research program but also guides IAI science governance towards its mandate of providing the best science for informed decision making on issues of global change on the continent.\r\n\r\nThe Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) was created by an international agreement concluded among representatives of American States, namely the Agreement Establishing the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research, done at Montevideo on May 13, 1992 ('the IAI Agreement'). The IAI Agreement created an intergovernmental organization for the purposes of coordinating and promoting scientific research related to global change. The Institute has an evolving 'Scientific Agenda' identifying particular areas for research. Full membership in the IAI is limited to States. \r\n\r\nThe Institute is governed by an annual Conference of the Parties, and by a subsidiary Executive Council (EC). The US Government currently chairs the EC. The IAI possesses the fundamental institutional characteristics of an international organization: it was created by international agreement, is composed of States and is governed by governing bodies composed of representatives of States. \r\n\r\nThe US Government participates actively in the IAI. The United States played a leading role in the creation of the IAI and has been an active participant in the IAI since its creation. Senior US Government officials have served on the Executive Council and held other responsible positions related to IAI activities. Furthermore, the IAI has been listed by the State Department and by the Office of Personnel Management as an international organization within the meaning of the Federal Employees International Organization Service Act, covered by 5 U.S.C. 3343 and 5 U.S.C. 3581, and as such has been recognized by State and OPM as a legitimate International Treaty Organization.",
