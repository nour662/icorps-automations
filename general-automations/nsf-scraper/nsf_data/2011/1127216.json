 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are normally not aware that our eyes and head are always in motion. Yet small, involuntary head and eye movements continually occur, even when we attempt to keep our gaze fixed on a point in the scene. It has long been known that the temporal modulations resulting from these movements are essential for seeing: the world becomes progressively fainter and will eventually fade altogether when the head and eyes are immobilized. However, the specific mechanisms by which fixational movements contribute to vision remain unknown. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Rucci and his team at Boston University will measure microscopic head and eye movements in human observers and reconstruct the input signals entering their eyes. The investigators will then use these data to quantify the impact of the observer's actions on the sensory flow of information and examine how this flow changes during the execution of different visual activities.\r\n\r\nThis research will investigate the mechanisms by which fixational movements contribute to the processing of visual information in the brain and the establishment of a stable visual percept. Elucidating the impact of fixational movements is critical to advancing our knowledge of how the visual system functions and how to build machines which replicate human visual capabilities. Furthermore, abnormal fixational eye movements\r\noccur in various pathological conditions. A thorough understanding of the functions of fixational eye movements may lead to treatment of the visual impairments associated with such conditions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHumans are not aware that their head and eyes are always in motion.  Small involuntary movements, known as fixational head and eye movements, occur incessantly, even when attempting to maintain steady gaze on a point.  These movements displace the image on the retina by amounts that would be immediately visible had they resulted from the motion of objects in the scene rather than the observer\u00c6s motor activity.  It has long been known that the temporal modulations resulting from fixational movements are essential for maintaining visibility: visual percepts becomes progressively fainter and eventually fade altogether when retinal image motion is completely eliminated.  However, the specific mechanisms by which these movements contribute to visual perception are unclear.  In fact, since simultaneous measurement of very small head and eye movements is technically challenging, surprisingly little was known before this project about the characteristics of the spatiotemporal stimulus on the retina during normal head-free viewing, even though this is the actual input signal to the visual system.\n\nIn this project, with funding from the National Science Foundation, researchers at Boston University examined the fixational head and eye movements performed by human observers during normal viewing of natural scenes.  Using these behavioral measurements, the team reconstructed the input signals impinging onto retinal receptors and examined the impact of the observer's motor activity on the sensory flow of visual information.  Natural input signals were then presented to computational models of neurons in the retina and the early stages of the visual system to study how the luminance modulations resulting from fixational movements affect spatial representations.  These studies have revealed that fixational head and eye movements jointly transform spatial information into a spatiotemporal pattern of retinal stimulation with very specific characteristics.  The resulting motion of the retinal image interacts with the characteristics of natural scenes to yield temporal modulations that facilitate efficient neural encoding and the extraction of important features in the scene.   \n\nIntellectual merit.  This project has generated highly valuable knowledge on the mechanisms by which fixational head and eye movements, together, contribute to the acquisition and processing of visual information.  Elucidation of these mechanisms is critical for understanding how the visual system extracts vital cues from the incoming flow of retinal stimulation and reaches reliable representations of the surrounding space. \n\nBroader impact.  In addition to advancing current understanding of the mechanisms responsible for visual perception, the knowledge acquired in this project also bears important clinical implications.   Abnormal fixational instability occurs in many pathological conditions, and analysis of its impact is essential for fully understanding the origins of the visual impairments associated with these conditions.  The knowledge generated by this project is therefore a prerequisite for making progress toward the development of treatments and effective prosthetic devices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/24/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michele Rucci"
