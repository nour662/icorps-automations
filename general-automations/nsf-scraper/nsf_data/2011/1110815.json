 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation improvement project will study the effects of seabird-derived nutrients on coral reef ecosystems across multiple atolls in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands. Specifically, the study will test the hypothesis that sea bird colonies augment  nutrient import to coral reefs,  leading to increased coral reef algal cover and abundance of herbivorous fishes.  Three approaches will be used: a survey comparing coral reef communities with and without seabird colonies, an analysis of energy pathways from producers to consumers in single reefs, and a transplant experiment between coral reefs with and without seabird colonies.\r\n\r\nCoral reef ecosystems and seabird colonies are two of the world?s most endangered marine ecosystems.  Understanding the potential indirect impact of seabirds on coral reefs is important for the design of coral reef preservation efforts.  This study will promote new synergies in international conservation efforts.",
