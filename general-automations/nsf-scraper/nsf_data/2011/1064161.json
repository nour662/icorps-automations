 "awd_abstract_narration": "Government spending on research and development of alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power is growing around the world.  Many of these technologies are still too costly to be competitive with fossil fuels without some public support. Yet assessing the effectiveness of the research support is complex, particularly because there is a mix of both public and private research funding. In addition, because government support is for basic, rather than directly applied research, there is a long lag between research results and the development of the final commercialized product, so it may take a number of years for its effect on technology to be realized.  \r\n\r\nThis project addresses three research questions in this context:  First, how does government R&D affect the returns to basic research?  Second, are there diminishing returns to government R&D support, so that increases in R&D support less fruitful projects?  Third, what is the impact of these publications on applied research?  The project builds a database that uses data on scientific publications from the U.S., Japan, and Europe to assess the effect of government-sponsored energy R&D.   \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The project develops a new theoretical framework for evaluating government R&D which enables the study of marginal as well as average affects.  It also creates a unique data base to answer these important questions by linking publication data to citations on U.S. energy patents.  The database enables important questions to be addressed, such as examining how long it takes for publications to be cited by a patent and what information is most useful to the development of new technology. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The research could potentially be used to provide guidelines to help allocate government research dollars more effectively.  The broader impacts to society at large is thus in the form of potential changes in energy and climate policy.  More broadly, evidence on the potential for diminishing returns to government funding due to adjustment costs informs not only energy R&D policy, but also proposals for research funding increases in other sectors.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Across the world, governments are spending more money on research and development (R&amp;D) for alternative energy sources, such as wind and solar power.  After over a decade of stagnant growth, energy R&amp;D expenditures in International Energy Agency member countries grew by nearly a factor of four since 2000.  Assessing the effectiveness of these government-funded research programs is complex.  Government spending occurs in tandem with private research funding.  As government R&amp;D support occurs further upstream from the final commercialized product, it takes longer to have an observable effect on outcomes than private R&amp;D.  At the same time, both private and public R&amp;D are driven by the same demand-side influences, such as energy prices and environmental policy. All these factors make it difficult for researchers to separate the effects of government-funded energy R&amp;D from other efforts designed to support alternative energy.  To disentangle the effect of each type of R&amp;D, funding for this project supported the development of an international database on scientific publications to assess the effect of government-sponsored energy R&amp;D. The unique cross-national nature of this database allows us to separate the impact of additional government R&amp;D funding from other efforts used to enhance markets for alternative energy.  We use these data to address two important questions regarding energy R&amp;D policy. \nFirst, we ask how long it takes for energy R&amp;D to provide successful research outcomes.  Within the energy R&amp;D literature, most studies consider only a single year of energy R&amp;D or construct aggregated stocks of past R&amp;D efforts using predetermined rates of decay.  By focusing on both inputs and outputs of the research process, this study provides new evidence on the timing of these flows and suggests that simply focusing on a single year of energy R&amp;D omits longer run effects from R&amp;D spending.  We find evidence of new publications occurring up to ten years after initial research funding.\nAs the ultimate goal of government energy R&amp;D funding is not a publication, but rather a new technology, any evaluation of government R&amp;D should also ask whether any resulting increase in basic science outputs leads to new applications.  For this, we link our publication data to patent data, which reflect the output of applied research efforts.  Related patent applications begin soon after funding and continue for up to 13 years.  That long lags matter is important to the evaluation of energy R&amp;D, as many studies evaluating the effect of government R&amp;D on innovation consider just contemporary or one-year lagged energy R&amp;D. While these studies often find little effect of energy R&amp;D on private sector innovation, failure to consider sufficient lags call these results into question.  Moreover, these long lags suggest that policy makers practice patience when evaluating the results of public research projects, as the fruits of these efforts may not be apparent immediately.\nSecond, we ask whether adjustment costs associated with large increases in research funding result in diminishing returns to government R&amp;D.  These may occur because of adjustment costs, or because government R&amp;D supports work that would have otherwise been financed through other means.  Moreover, assuming that funding agencies support the highest quality projects first, as funding increases and governments provide support to a greater number of projects, the additional projects supported may be of lower quality than those supported in leaner budget years.  Importantly, we find little evidence of diminishing returns to public energy R&amp;D.  We find no evidence that the increase in publications from new R&amp;D funding is smaller following large increases in energy R&amp;D.  Moreover, factors found to influence private R&amp;D activity in other research, such as energy prices and policy, hav..."
