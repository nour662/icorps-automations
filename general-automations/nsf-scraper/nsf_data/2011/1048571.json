This workshop precedes the annual Joint Mathematics Meeting in New Orleans and takes the opportunity of this close-by event to gather well-known experts, young researchers, and graduate students for additional discussion and interactions. \r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop would bring together people working in different parts of harmonic and geometric analysis. This meeting will provide a stimulating forum to cross over the narrow imaginary boundaries between research groups with the aim that techniques, tools and ideas from different specialties will create new collaboration. The workshop will also create a forum where young emerging researchers have an opportunity to meet and interact with established experts in a small group. It will also give graduate students an opportunity to present their work and get new ideas and perspectives.",
