 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  The purpose of the proposed research is to design, fabricate and characterize novel nanowire broken-gap tunneling field-effect transistors (NW BG-TFETs), devices that have the potential to substantially reduce power in computational systems by simultaneously achieving sub-60-mV/decade subthreshold slope and drive currents comparable to MOSFETs.  The proposed work has strong intellectual merit as it addresses a critical problem for future CMOS scaling, which is how to reduce logic power consumption.  It does so by exploring a new device concept, the NW BG-TFET that has not yet been experimentally explored.  In particular, project intends to provide a thorough understanding of all aspects of the device design and operation, including the influence of interface states and trap-assisted tunneling, mechanisms that must be fully understood if this new device is to function as intended.\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed project could have substantial benefits for understanding the role of surface-mediated transport in TFETs and nanometer-scale devices in general. It also provides an ideal training ground for graduate students, in that the industrial collaboration allows students to obtain direct industry interactions that will better allow them to understand the real world applications of their research endeavors. The project also offers an opportunity for classroom education, as the device provides an ideal example of the factors that affect and ultimately limit CMOS scaling. Finally, K-12 educational outreach activities are tightly integrated into this work, and this project provides numerous opportunities for demonstrations of nanotechnology that can generate excitement about engineering and scientific careers in general.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to explore design strategies for fabricating a novel type of transistor called a tunneling field-effect transistor (TFET).  TFETs have the potential to switch between \"ON\" and \"OFF\" states with less voltage than a conventional metal-oxide-semiconductor FET (MOSFET), but most designs have the problem that the \"ON\" current is too low for practical applications.  In this project, the goal is to develop ways to utilize a so-called \"broken-gap\" heterostructure to allow high current ON-state current, while still achieving abrupt switching behavior.  The achievements of the project have been detailed in the report below:\n\nYear 1: In the first year of the project, the primary finding was to understand the fundamental trade-offs that exist between achieving high drive current and steep subthreshold slope in III-V TFETs, as well as the scalability and NFET/PFET asymmetry problems of III-Vs.  This led to the refocusing of work onto 2D materials, and in particular, the transition metal dichalchogenides (TMDs), which provide improved scalability and NFET/PFET asymmetry.  The challenge was then to identify materials that could provide a broken-gap band alignment that could enable high drive currents.\n\nYear 2: In the second program year, work focused on developing a fabrication process for TMD-based TFETs.  The work was primarily focused on SnSe2 and MoTe2, which should have a broken-gap band line-ups needed for TFETs.  During this year, work also began on creating an aligned exfoliation setup needed to create the heterostructure from flakes of exfoliated TMD materials.\n\nYear 3: In this year, demonstration of the individual components of the TFET were demonstrated.  The first demonstration of an SnSe2 n-MOSFET using exfoliated material was reported, and MoTe2 p-MOSFETs with very high drive current were fabricated and the results presented.  Through this work, additional concepts for novel 2D devices were developed, including a novel use of MoS2 as a low-leakage memory technology.\n\nYear 4: In the final extenion year of this project, additional applications of 2D materials were explored.  The results of high-performance logic inverters made from MoS2 and BP were submitted for publication, DRAM circuits fabricated from MoS2 with sub-fA leakage currents were demonstrated, and a novel method of creating black phosphorus heterostructures was also developed.\n\nIn summary, this work provided new knowledge on the design of ultra-low-power transistor technology, and led to several promising new device concepts that could have applications in a wide range of other disciplines.  This project also provided an excellent opporutnity for graduate and undergraduate student education.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven J Koester"
