Anne Kelley and David Kelley, from the University of California, Merced, will investigate by resonance Raman spectroscopy such effects as electronic dephasing and coupling of optical phonons to excitons, electrons, and holes in II-VI nanocrystals and heterostructures. The work will contribute to our understanding of ultrafast dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of the exact ways in which electric charge migrates in nanometer-sized structures is essential for the design and implementation of new technologies that can lead to further miniaturization of devices. The work by Drs. Kelley and Kelley will reveal details of charge migration in nanometer-sized structures and inform future technological advances. Along the way, the investigators will engage graduate and undergraduate students - many from groups traditionally under-represented in science - in cutting-edge research and discovery.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project uses chemical synthesis, a laser-based light scattering technique known as Raman spectroscopy, and computer modeling to study the vibrational motions of the atoms in tiny chunks of semiconductors known as quantum dots.  Specifically, it is directed toward understanding how light or electrical energy put into the quantum dot gets converted into heat through these vibrations, an inefficient energy-wasting process.  Understanding how this happens, and therefore how it can be minimized, will help us determine how to make quantum dots that can perform more efficiently as materials for solar energy capture and conversion, artificial lighting, and laser-based biomedical imaging.  These studies also contribute to more fundamental knowledge about the nature of the chemical bonding in the material and how it is changed upon interaction with light.\n\nDuring the funded project period, we developed the experimental apparatus and the methods of analysis needed to use Raman spectroscopy to quantitate the effect of the atomic vibrations on the quantum mechanical states of the quantum dot that are produced by light absorption.  This is known as electron-phonon coupling.  We also adapted existing computer programs, and wrote others from scratch, that allow us to test various physical models for electron-phonon coupling and provide insight into the connection between experiment and theory.  We synthesized different types of quantum dots based on the semiconductor material cadmium selenide.  These had different crystal structures (different specific ways that the atoms are arranged in the solid), different sizes, and, in some cases, \"shells\" of a different semiconductor material.  The Raman spectra were measured and analyzed to determine the electron-phonon coupling and the experimental results were compared with theoretical models.  We found that the electron-phonon coupling strength is essentially independent of crystal structure, and that its dependence on quantum dot size and shell parameters is much weaker than predicted by long-standing theoretical constructs.  This suggests that a completely new physical model is needed to describe how the vibrations of a quantum dot influence its interactions with light.  Such a model may allow us to design and synthesize quantum dots that will perform more efficiently in technological applications.\n\nThe results of these studies have been published in seven articles in peer-reviewed professional journals and have been presented at several scientific conferences.  This NSF-supported research is also coupled to the educational mission of the University of California, Merced through involvement of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the research.  Merced, the newest of the UC campuses, has been open for only ten years and is still growing rapidly.  It is a Hispanic Serving Institution and more than half of its undergraduates are first-generation college stsudents, and it serves as an engine of upward mobility for many students from traditionally underrepresented groups.  This grant supported and trained two postdoctoral fellows, three graduate students, and three undergraduate students who contributed to the research, presented their work at scientific conferences, and were co-authors on published papers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne M Kelley"
