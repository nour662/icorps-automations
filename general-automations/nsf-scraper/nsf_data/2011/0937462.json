 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project covers the concept and technical details of maintaining and operating (M&O) the IceCube Neutrino Observatory upon the completion of construction and deployment of the 86-string array under the MREFFC project. The University of Wisconsin (UW) offers their proven approach to providing M&O for IceCube based on their experience from both constructing the detector and starting its partial operation. Learned lessons that shaped this project include the need for: (1) resources for both distributed and centrally managed activities, and (2) additional accountability mechanisms for \"in-kind\" and institutional contributions; both are necessary to ensure that the detector maintains its capability to produce quality scientific data at the level required to achieve the detector's scientific discovery objectives. The project exploits a balance between the Core M&O tasks that are centrally funded through UW-Madison, and the \"in-kind\" tasks that are supported through the IceCube Collaborating Institutions. The success of the IceCube research will enhance scientific and technological understanding on many levels through broad dissemination of data and discoveries. The proposed distributed model of the IceCube M&O and scientific data analyses results in educational opportunities and mentoring at all levels, from undergraduates to postdoctoral researchers, and in a broad set of disciplines including operations, management, engineering, computing, and scientific research. IceCube is a unique detector that inspires innovative capacities of a new generation of scientists and engineers to solve the most vexing scientific problems by applying new knowledge about the Universe.",
