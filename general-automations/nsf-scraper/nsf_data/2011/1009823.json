 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a three-year continuing award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at the University of Maryland (UMD)College Park entitled, \"RET Site in Engineering:Connecting with Community Colleges under the direction of Dr. Isabel K. Lloyd. \r\n\r\nThis RET in Engineering Site proposes a transformative exchange between five Maryland community colleges (CC) and UMD faculty over a six-week summer program.  These community colleges provide most the UMD College of Engineering's transfer students and serve large numbers of students from underrepresented groups, including minorities, women, and economically disadvantaged students. The focus of the program is to forge intellectual connections across disciplines as well as institutional connections across campuses.  A total of thirty-six, community college faculty, twelve each summer for three years, will be mentored by UMD faculty and will pursue cutting edge research in engineering, integrate fundamental concepts in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) together with technological innovation into community college STEM classrooms. Institutional connections will be developed and strengthened, to facilitate successful transition of associate degree students into the Clark School st the University of Maryland.  This RET Site will demonstrate that two-year colleges and research universities can work together to prepare students to join the 21st Century workforce.",

The participants came from six community colleges in Maryland (Anne Arundel Community College, Cecil College, Harford Community College, Howard Community College, Montgomery College and Prince George&rsquo;s Community College) and taught classes in seven disciplines (Engineering and Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Biology, Computer Science and Earth Sciences).</p>\n<p>Our definition of a curriculum element was very flexible to allow each community college teacher to translate their experience into something that would enhance learning by their students.

Examples of curriculum elements are available at the program&rsquo;s Curriculum in a Box website, <a href=\"http://www.mse.umd.edu/ret/curriculuminabox\">http://www.mse.umd.edu/ret/curriculuminabox</a>. As of December 2014, 32 of the 33 curriculum elements had been implemented at least once. Of these twenty had been implemented twice and ten had been implemented three or more times. This means that at least 22 classes and about 1200 community college students have been directly impacted.
