The conference is known for its cutting edge science and breadth of coverage, providing a forum for the exploration of a wide range of epigenetic phenomena and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in numerous model organisms, as well as humans. By stressing the presentation of unpublished data, the conference will facilitate the exchange and dissemination of information that will help move the field into new areas of inquiry, employing the latest methods and technologies. This year the conference will have 9 sessions: 1-Epigenetic mechanisms I: DNA methylation; 2- Environment, aging, memory and behavioral epigenetics; 3 Epialleles and epigenetic inheritance; 4- Developmental programming and reprogramming; 5- Epigenetic mechanisms II: RNA-mediated heterochromatin formation and gene rearrangement; 6- Epigenetics and disease; 7- Gene dosage control mechanisms; 8- Epigenetics and the genome: position-effects, replication and nuclear organization; and 9- Instructing the next generation through DNA imprints and RNA signaling.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nIn addition to invited, established investigators who are leaders in the field, the conference program developed by the organizers of the 2011 Epigenetics Gordon Research Conference includes a substantial number of young investigators who are new to the conference and whose exciting work expands the frontiers of the field. Registration and/or travel support will be made available to attendees from domestic minority-serving institutions. Sixteen (33%) of the confirmed speakers and discussion leaders for the 2011 conference are women.",
