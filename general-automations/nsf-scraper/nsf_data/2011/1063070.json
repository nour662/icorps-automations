Approximately eight students per year will be selected from a national pool to explore three research topics under the guidance of faculty mentors.  Three Lafayette students will also participate.  Research projects, which will vary from summer to summer, will be drawn from the following areas: combinatorics, differential geometry, financial mathematics, finite geometry and games, geometric group theory, mathematical computation, number theory, mathematical biology, and recreational mathematics.  The research program will be supplemented by student presentations, guest speakers, informal gatherings, along with possible workshops/conferences.  These experiences will give the student participants the opportunity to share ideas, learn more mathematics and become part of a research community.  Students will be encouraged to present their results at conferences such as the Joint Mathematics Meetings and, when appropriate, mentors and their groups will write up their results for publication.\r\n   \r\nAll projects will involve the investigation of open research problems under the direction of a faculty mentor.  The faculty mentors come from a pool of successful researchers with extensive experience in working and publishing with undergraduates--students from past Lafayette College REUs have regularly presented at national conferences and have published in high-quality journals.  By working in an exciting mathematical environment surrounded by talented peers, student participants in the REU will gain an in-depth, meaningful experience to supplement their undergraduate mathematical education.  The program will also provide motivation for students considering graduate studies in mathematics-intensive fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAt the Lafayette College REU, for each of three years approximately 10 students participated in an eight week program where they conducted original research.  The students were mentored by three faculty mentors; the projects came from pure and applied fields including combinatorics, discrete geometry, mathematical finance, algebra, statistics, and number theory.  The primary goal of the program was for students, working as a team, to experience the entire creative process involved in mathematical research, from developing the research problem to writing up a solution for publication.  An important secondary goal of the REU was to allow students to determine their level of interest in a career or graduate studies in a mathematics-related field.  By the completion of the grant, all nine groups had made significant progress on their problems, enough to merit publication.  These results are either now in print or under review in peer-reviewed journals.  Some of the program participants have not yet completed their undergraduate studies, but of those that have, most are either pursing graduate studies in a mathematics-related field or are in a career with a strong mathematical component.  \n\nThe summer program was supplemented by a number of math-related events.  A diverse group of speakers provided a look into current mathematical research, enriching students\u00c6 mathematical background.  The speakers were both male and female, and represented a mix of backgrounds, ranks, and careers.  Students had an opportunity to interact with the speakers in a less formal setting as well, to follow up on particular concerns and additional topics of interest.  Students also received advice about applying to graduate school, and general background concerning graduate studies in mathematics and mathematics-related fields.  This advice extended to information about other STEM careers. \n\nIn addition to the creation of new mathematics, this program focused on the communication of results, both orally and in writing.  Student groups presented their investigations to their peers three times during the program.  These provided an opportunity for students to give and receive critiques about presenting mathematics to a general audience.  Additionally, every group  presented their work in more formal settings at one or two national conferences.  These experiences gave participants the opportunity to share ideas and learn more mathematics, and showed them what it is like to be part of a research community.   \n\nOverall 31 students, fairly evenly split between male and female, participated in the REU program during the course of the grant.  In the past cycle of this program at Lafayette College we endeavored to increase the number of participants from underrepresented groups, including race, gender, and socioeconomic status.  There was some success in this regard which we hope to continue to improve going forward. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Qin Lu"
