 "awd_abstract_narration": "In previous NSF-funded studies, small video and data recorders were developed and used that can be attached to free-ranging marine mammals to observe their underwater behavior, track their three-dimensional movements and record their environment (e.g., Science 283:993-996, 1999; Science 288:133-136, 2000). This project builds upon this success by developing miniature, animal-borne oceanographic data recorders (mini-ODRs) that will record fine spatial and temporal resolution data on conductivity (salinity), temperature and dissolved oxygen as well as three-dimensional location in the water column and geolocation at the surface using marine animals as small as 12 kg.  \r\n\r\nMarine mammals and other pelagic vertebrates (e.g., sea turtles, penguins large fishes) that range throughout the world's oceans and descend to depths of up to 2,000 m have the potential of carrying oceanographic instruments that record fine spatial and temporal resolution data at relatively low cost, especially in areas that are not frequently visited by research vessels (e.g., the Arctic Ocean and Southern Ocean) and during the winter when sea ice and harsh weather pose severe logistical challenges. The simultaneous measurement of conductivity (salinity), temperature and dissolved oxygen as a function of location (vertical and horizontal) in the water column is fundamental in understanding the physical and biological oceanography of a region. Such fine resolution data, when applied to large geographic areas, can provide critical information on ocean circulation and structure which influence climate and ecosystem processes over large areas. The oceans are a key element in understanding climate change, and there is an increasing need for synoptic data on a global level. Most sub-surface oceanographic data have been obtained from ship-based surveys and the deployment of drifters. Animal-borne instruments provide a relatively low cost alternative for augmenting these data, especially in polar regions.",
