 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research team seeks to extend absolute-dated records of the oxygen isotopic composition of speleothem calcite from the Northern Hemisphere (southeast Asia) and from Southern Hemisphere (South America) low latitude sites.  For each of these regions, the investigators aim to: (i) extend the records deeper in time; (ii) broaden the geographic coverage within the region; (iii) increase the oxygen isotope resolution within key time ranges; and (iv) apply newly developed dating techniques to refine and extend chronologies. \r\n\r\nFor the northern site, the team plans to extend the record an additional three glacial-interglacial cycles back to about 650,000 years ago and also establish a record in the mid-Quaternary (1.3 to 1.5 million years ago). For the southern site, the researchers seek to develop a record covering the last few glacial-interglacial cycles.\r\n\r\nWith these new records, the principal investigators will test hypotheses related to: (1) the causes of millennial-scale climate change; (2) the causes of ice age terminations; (3) the mechanisms for long-term monsoon variability; and (4) the controls on the oxygen isotopic composition of rainfall in regions affected by monsoon rainfall.\r\n\r\nA better understanding of the temporal and spatial variability of precipitation over low latitude sites would be of great scientific value to the wider science community.  Through this project, the researchers will continue to develop strong international collaborations with Chinese and Brazilian scientist.  The project also supports a post-doctoral scholar.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overarching aim of this project was to determine the climate history of parts of Asia and South America, as a means of understanding the causes of climate change world-wide.  Our climate histories cover various portions of the last 640,000 years of earth history.  This most recent portion of climate history includes the last 7 ice ages.  Most of our efforts focused on determining climate history from deposits collected from caves on these two continents.  We dated these deposits using the uranium-thorium method, which allows us to fix the timeline for our climate histories very precisely. \n\nTwo particular records highlight our work on this project.  By analyzing Chinese cave deposits, we have reconstructed 640,000 years of Asian Monsoon rainfall history, a few decades by a  few decades.  This remarkable record demonstrates the effect of the earth's continually changing orbit and axis of rotation on the earth's climate.  It also exhibits numerous examples of abrupt climate change, change that occurs rapidly (in years to decades) and affects a large portion of the earth.  Using this record, we have furthered our knowledge of the causes of the ending of ice ages and the causes of abrupt climate change.\n\nThe second remarkable record comes from caves under the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. This record covers times from the last ice age to modern times.  This record shows that rainfall in the Amazon changed abruptly many times during the last ice age and that the general climate was drier during the last ice age.  This latter observation supports the idea that for regions in the sub-tropics and tropics, areas that are now relatively wet will become yet wetter and areas that are now relatively dry will become yet drier, accompanying global warming.\n\nOverall, this project has enhanced collaborative relationships among U.S., Chinese, and Brazilian scientists.  It has also furthered our understanding of the root causes of climate change.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/27/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: R. Lawrence Edwards"
