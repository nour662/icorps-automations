 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Brian Coppola and Melanie Sanford at the University of Michigan.  The research projects supported in this site are in broad areas of chemistry.  Undergraduates will be recruited to this site primarily from institutions that lack infrastructure to support undergraduate research, including students from underrepresented groups.  The site will support fourteen students per summer in a ten week program.  A sample of the projects that undergraduates will work on include:  (1)  ultrafast laser spectroscopy of solvation dynamics; (2)  the study of nickel-based catalysts for chain-growth polymerizations; (3)  two-photon spectroscopy of novel materials; (4)  the formation and study of semifluorinated alkylsiloxane self-assembled monolayers; (5) the study of CH activation with Pt(II) diimine catalysts  (6) the study of the kinetics for ligand attachment to dendritic nanoparticles.   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, and will have expanded opportunities for presentation of research at national disciplinary meetings.  \r\n\r\nYoung scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in the chemical sciences, with a strong emphasis on areas of science with important societal impacts.  Undergraduate researchers participating in this site will have significant, hands-on access to sophisticated research tools.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.",
