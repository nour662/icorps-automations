The 2011 GRC on Catchment Science will be chaired by Irena Creed (University of Western Ontario, Canada) and co-chaired by Doerthe Tetzlaff (University of Aberdeen, Scotland). Thomas Bullen (U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park CA, USA) is Vice Chair and has the primary role of organizing the poster sessions. The theme of the conference is ?Sentinels of Global Change.? Keynote speakers include James Kirchner, Charles Driscoll, Charles Vorosmarty, Leroy Poff, Kevin Bishop, Susan Brantley, Lawrence Band, Upmanu Lall, Andras Szollosy-Nagy (Director of the Division of Water Sciences, UNESCO) among others.",
