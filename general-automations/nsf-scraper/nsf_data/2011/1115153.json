 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two most important commodities of the 21st century are time and energy; traffic congestion wastes both. Several disciplines have studied the traffic congestion problem using mathematical models, simulation studies and field surveys.  Recently, due to the sensor instrumentation of road networks and the availability of commodity sensors from which traffic information can be derived (e.g., CCTV cameras, GPS devices), a large volume of real-time traffic data at high spatiotemporal resolutions has become available.   These data lay the ground for better understanding of the transportation network and for new applications.\r\n\r\nThe first objective of this project is to study the efficient acquisition and storage of traffic data.  In particular, at the acquisition time, compact traffic patterns and outliers are constructed from raw data in real-time, supporting fast queries with approximate results and error bounds.    The second objective is to utilize the traffic patterns to enable two critical query types that are building blocks of several important applications in time-dependent road networks: 1) shortest travel-time computation, and 2) k-nearest-neighbor search.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project is to bring large amount of historical and real-time traffic data at the fidelities unseen before to the fingertip of transportation engineers, policy makers and end-users.  This in turn enables them to alleviate one of the major problems of megacities, the main societal fabrics of the 21st century. Research results are incoporated into courses on Database Systems and Geospatial Information Management taught at University of Southern California and are also disseminated through papers published in conferences and journals. Details about the project including publications and open-source code are available at the project website: http://infolab.usc.edu/projects/TransDec/.",

We showed that the prior techniques that assume constant edge weights on road segments fail to address the fastest path and kNN queries in real-world time-dependent spatial networks. In addition, we concluded that it is infeasible to extend existing pre-computation techniques (necessary to expedite query results) to time-dependent networks due to very large input size (i.e., number of different fastest paths between any pair of nodes). To address these challenges we developed a bi-directional time-dependent A* algorithm and a novel network partitioning technique for efficient evaluation of time-dependent fastest path and kNN search, respectively. We have conducted many experiments which provided us with new insights. For example, one observations is that time-dependent route planning can save drivers on average 18% of travel-time compared to its static counterparts. In addition, we have developed short-term and long-term traffic prediction techniques to accurately model the current and future state of travel-times under normal conditions and in the presence of events (e.g., accidents, weather conditions and concerts). &nbsp;Our experiments show that our algorithms can improve the accuracy of traditional predictors by up to 67% and 78% in short-term and long-term predictions, respectively.</p>\n<p>The outcome of our research resulted in big-data frameworks and tools for real-time decision-making and management of transportation systems.

For example, as a result of our collaboration with Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Agency (LA Metro) we developed a BigData framework- called TransDec- that maintains the largest traffic data repository in Southern California. TransDec collects and archives data from more than 20,000 sensors (providing information as frequent as every 30 seconds) received from 7 different agencies (e.g., Caltrans, LADOT, CHP), and enables historical and real-time querying and analysis of transportation datasets (see Figure 1).
