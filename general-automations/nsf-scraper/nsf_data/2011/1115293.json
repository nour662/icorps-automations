 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study focuses on problems from polynomial\r\noptimization and convex algebraic geometry. The latter is a new\r\nresearch area that concerns convex sets and convex hulls of sets that\r\nare described algebraically and arise in optimization.  The key tool is the use of efficient algorithms in  semidefinite programming, a branch of convex optimization  that is used in polynomial optimization. The\r\nfirst set of questions studies the general phenomenon of when a given\r\nconvex body is the linear projection of a slice (by an affine plane)\r\nof a closed convex cone. This phenomena is central to all\r\nlift-and-project methods for discrete and polynomial optimization. This study\r\nprovides a uniform view of all lift-and-project\r\nmethods via new notions of cone factorizations of certain operators\r\nassociated to the convex body. The investigator and collaborators have\r\nrecently constructed a new hierarchy of convex relaxations for\r\nalgebraic sets called theta bodies. Various open questions about these\r\nbodies are posed. The methods\r\nfrom polynomial optimization and convex algebraic geometry can be applied to problems\r\nfrom computer vision. Here the application is primarily to object reconstruction from\r\nimages taken by multiple cameras.\r\n\r\nThe work of the PI with her collaborators improvies our understanding of the algebraic and geometric\r\nstructures that underlie optimization problems that involve\r\npolynomials. Such problems have a wide array of applications and admit\r\nmethods from both the algebraic and analytic sides of\r\nmathematics. This research considers both improvements in our understanding of the theoretical aspects of polynomial optimization, and the application of these methods to problems in computer vision.",
