 "awd_abstract_narration": "A big theme in number theory in the last 50 years has been the relationship\r\nbetween automorphic forms, Galois representations and objects from algebraic\r\ngeometry. There is an extensive web of extraordinary conjectures (for instance\r\nthe Artin conjecture, the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, Langlands' conjectures,\r\nSerre's conjecture and the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture) linking these\r\nthree seemingly very different subjects (which relate to analysis, algebra and\r\ngeometry respectively). Progress on these conjectures is currently very exciting.\r\nUnder previous NSF grants the PI, with various collaborators, completed\r\nthe proof of the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture; proved the local Langlands\r\nconjecture for GL(n) over a p-adic field; proved the Sato-Tate conjecture for\r\nelliptic curves over totally real fields; proved the first general automorphy lifting\r\ntheorems and potential automorphy theorems for Galois representations\r\nof arbitrary dimension; and proved that the L-function of any polarized, regular,\r\nirreducible motive over a CM field has meromorphic continuation to the\r\nwhole complex plane and satisfies the expected functional equation. The PI\r\nproposes to continue to improve the currently available automorphy lifting\r\nand potential automorphy theorems; to relate the cohomology of Rapoport-\r\nZink spaces to the local Langlands conjecture for groups other than GL(n); with\r\nKevin Buzzard and Joe Rabinoff to prove the Artin conjecture for odd degree\r\ntwo representations of the Galois group of a totally real field in which 5 splits\r\ncompletely; and to think about more speculative problems relating Galois representations and automorphic forms, for instance how to understand the case of very degenerate Hodge-Tate numbers/infinitesimal character. In addition the PI will continue his work with post-docs and, particularly, with graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis circle of ideas is the one that led to Andrew Wiles' celebrated proof of\r\nFermat's last theorem after over 300 years. They fall into the general area of\r\narithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics:\r\nnumber theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily\r\nfruitful. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes.\r\nSuch codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact\r\ndisks.",
