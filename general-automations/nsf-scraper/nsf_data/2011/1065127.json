 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nThe focus of the proposal is on finding semantically equivalent files in an efficient and scalable manner.  If two files are identical, they are candidates for optimizations to reduce storage costs, increase performance, and generally improve the system. Traditionally, two files are only considered equivalent if they are byte-by-byte identical - i.e., byte equivalence. However, this team's preliminary research shows that there are many other files that are essentially equivalent, even though the bytes they contain are not the same. This proposal will investigate how to find such cases and perform optimizations that make use of semantic equivalence, rather than byte equivalence.\r\n\r\nThis project will design and implement a framework, Facets, which explores new capabilities by applying optimizations to files that are essentially transformed versions of each other. Many optimizations and improvements can be applied to semantically equivalent files, including:\r\n\r\n     -Ensuring that the security of semantically equivalent files is preserved\r\n     -Easing backup and maintenance of semantically equivalent files in various formats, fidelities, and versions\r\n     -Using semantically equivalent files to improve performance, reliability, and availability\r\n     -Regenerating semantically equivalent files to speed up recovery and network transfer\r\n     -Selecting which semantically equivalent files to access according to performance or energy constraints\r\n\r\nThis team's preliminary research shows that 5% of files on a typical user's machine are original content. The rest are copies of files from elsewhere or various derivatives of original content. While leveraging this observation to achieve advantages is not trivial, many significant improvements are possible if one can find these relationships and make proper use of them. These improvements include enhanced security, more efficient backup and restoration, better file caching, more intelligent tradeoffs in performance versus power use, and a host of other possibilities. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe code and techniques developed will be released in open source form. The team will take steps (such as applying for supplemental REU grants) to involve undergraduates in the research. They will give talks and recruit at Hispanic-serving institutions. Materials and concepts from the research will be incorporated into classes taught by the principal investigators at their institutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany computer systems take advantage of different data items that are equivalent.

This research seeks to relax the traditional notion of equivalence and explore what is possible if we take a broader view of what constitutes equivalence.  \n\nOne area of this research involves exploiting semantically equivalent representations of data for security purposes.

The developed techniques are patent pending, and results are published at the USENIX Security Conference. \n\nThe notion of semantic equivalence can also be applied in other areas.  Knowing that many data files are frequently accessed together, they can be physically represented as a single file, which is semantically equivalent to representing them as individual files.  By doing so, we can speed up the performance of storage by up to 27%.  Further, semantically equivalent content can be managed with the same security policy (e.g., secure deletion).  These results are published at the USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies and ACM Transactions on Storage.\n\nIn terms of education, this research has supported 1 postdoc, 4 graduate research assistants, and 2 undergraduate research assistants.  Three of these are from underrepresented groups.  The developed research infrastructures and gathered research data and traces have enabled 44 graduate students and 2 undergraduate students to contribute to this project through graduate-level course projects and independent research.  This grant enabled the completion of two Ph.D.s.  One is an assistant professor at the University of Northern Iowa; the other, at T-Mobile.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter L Reiher"
