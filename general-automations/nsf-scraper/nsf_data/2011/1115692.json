 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the development, analysis and application\r\nof numerical linear algebra tools for the quantitative study of\r\nimportant properties of large-scale complex networks, such as\r\ncentrality, betweenness and communicability measures. Specifically,\r\nthe investigator and his collaborators study efficient algorithms\r\nfor the fast approximation of the entries of matrix functions\r\nsuch as the exponential and the resolvent of adjacency matrices\r\nand graph Laplacians, as well as their traces. While these\r\nmatrices are quite sparse, in the case of complex networks\r\nthey behave very differently from the matrices associated with\r\nregular lattices (grids), such as those arising from discretizations\r\nof partial differential equations. Hence, there is a need to\r\ndevelop new methods, both computational and analytical, to deal\r\nwith these very large-scale problems. The investigator brings\r\ntogether expertise in classical numerical analysis and approximation\r\ntheory, as well as methods from spectral graph theory and modern\r\nnetwork analysis, to enable efficient computations involving large\r\ngraphs. Potential applications include the analysis of social networks,\r\nthe study of biological and neurological networks, applications in physics\r\nand operations research, and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the last decade or so, the emerging field of network science\r\nhas had a profound influence on such different domains as physics,\r\nchemistry, biology, operations research, engineering and the social\r\nsciences. A deep understanding of network structure and dynamics is\r\nof great importance also for Homeland Security and for many businesses,\r\nincluding financial institutions and e-commerce. Detailed, quantitative\r\nmodels of massive and complex networks are now pervasive owing to the unprecedented availability of data on just about any conceivable topic. Extracting useful information from these massive data sets and networks requires fast and accurate algorithms. Such algorithms can be used, for instance, to rank the `importance' of elements of a network, i.e., to determine which nodes are essential for the proper functioning of a network. They are also used to determine bottlenecks in a network, and critical connections in a graph. The importance of these notions for crucial parts of the infrastructure of a country, such as power or transportation grids,\r\ncannot be overstated. The investigator and his collaborators develop fast computer techniques to solve these and related problems.",
