 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2011, Intersections of Biology and Mathematical and Physical Sciences. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow at the intersection of biology with physics and engineering. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Daniel Allen is \"Biodiversity and engineering function: integrating physical processes into biodiversity and ecosystem function research.\" The host institutions for the fellowship are the University of Michigan and Virginia Tech, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Bradley Cardinale and Theresa Wynn.\r\n\r\nSome pressing environmental problems are being exacerbated by human-induced changes to riparian ecosystems that result in erosion and jointly influence fluid dynamics and materials transport along steam banks. It is not fully understood how plants modify the physical processes that control erosion by reinforcing soil with their roots. However, past research in this area has held a narrow view of biology, limiting ?biota? to a single species or functional group of plants. A completely separate area of research has shown that plant biodiversity can increase the density and biomass of roots produced by plant communities. The goal of this research is to merge these two areas of research to investigate how biodiversity influences physical processes and to conduct laboratory and field experiments to test if plant biodiversity reduces stream bank erosion.\r\n\r\nTraining objectives include fluid mechanics and sediment transport and, in biology, biodiversity and species coexistence theory.  Career development activities include learning to publish proficiently, especially at the interface of biology and physics; mentor undergraduate students; and improve teaching skills. A practical outcome of the research is determining which plants best stabilize stream banks, as stream bank erosion is one of the most pressing environmental problems affecting North American streams.  Educational outreach to undergraduate students and organizing a stream restoration project with public high school students are also being conducted.",

Interest in this topic dates as far back as Aristotle and Charles Darwin, and more recently, organisms that physically modify habitats and have significant effects on ecosystems have been termed \"ecosystem engineers\" or \"biophysical couplers.\" In spite of these efforts, studies in this field tend to view \"biota\" as a single species or functional group, though they do acknowledge differences between types of organisms (e.g. differences between of grasses and trees ). But this view ignores one of the most fundamental principles of ecology, that ecosystems contain multiple species that interact. \n\nResults from ecological studies have shown that as plant communities contain more species, it increases their ability to convert belowground inorganic resources to biomass.

We also sampled each site for woody plant species composition, identifiying each woody plant (tree and shrub) to species and measuring its size.\n\nIn contrast to our hypothesis, our data supportec a pathway where a higher migration rate indirectly increased woody plant abundance by directly increasing woody plant species richness. We did find more woody plant biomass at sites with more plant species, however our data appears to sup..."
