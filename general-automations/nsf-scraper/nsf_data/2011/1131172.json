 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to formulate and analyze Markov decision process models to enable vaccine clinicians to optimally balance the tradeoffs inherent to vaccine administration, especially in remote locations, e.g., rural areas and developing countries.  The main tradeoff is one between vaccine \"wastage\" and missed opportunities for vaccine administration.  Wastage is especially acute for vaccines that are packaged in large, multi-dose vials which once opened, must be used within a matter of hours; hence clinicians face difficult tradeoffs between opening a vial to satisfy a potentially small immediate demand, versus retaining the vial to satisfy a potentially large future demand.  Furthermore, because the power supply in remote areas of developing countries is often unreliable, the development of -passive cold boxes- that maintain temperature over several weeks - provided they are not opened excessively often is being considered; clinicians deciding when to retrieve vials from these cold boxes will face difficult tradeoffs between retrieving vials for potential immediate use, versus not having vaccines available in the face of future demand.  Moreover, the design specifications for these cold boxes are open questions that depend heavily on how their use will impact wastage and coverage in the field.\r\n\r\nAnticipated outcomes of this research include: (i) optimal vaccine administration policies (e.g., vial opening decisions and cold box retrieval decisions) for different situations (e.g., vaccine type(s), vial size(s), demand profile(s)) as a function of many variables (e.g., time of day, vial inventory, history of cold box openings); (ii) dissemination of operational guidelines that can be easily implemented by clinicians in the field; and (iii) insights into various cold box designs in with respect to vaccine coverage and wastage.  The results of the research will be disseminated within the US and internationally through the WHO website and potentially enable millions of additional vaccines to be administered annually throughout the world.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe prevalence of infectious diseases is a grave, global concern and millions of children remain at risk for diseases that are preventable through immunization.  One of the major factors contributing to vaccine-preventable deaths is the surprisingly large amount of vaccine wastage in developing countries; WHO estimates the overall global vaccine wastage rate to be a staggering 50% due to various factors.  Wastage is especially acute for vaccines that come in large, multi-dose vials which, once opened, must be used in a matter of hours or be discarded as so-called open vial waste.  As a result, clinicians in the field face difficult tradeoffs between opening a vial to satisfy a potentially small immediate demand (and discarding the remainder of the vial) versus retaining the vial to satisfy a potentially large future demand. Currently, there is evidence that some clinics may consider factors such as time of day when making vial opening decisions, although most clinics simply open vials whenever necessary during fixed daily hours of operation, which results in significant open vial waste and stockouts (i.e., planned vaccination sessions for which the clinic has run out of vials).\n\nIn this project, to determine how clinics can optimally tailor their vial opening decisions to maximize the number of vaccinations administered by reducing open vial waste, we formulate a mathematical model (specifically a Markov decision process) that dynamically determines whether or not to open a vial as a function of time of day, the number of vials remaining until the next shipment and the number of sessions remaining until the next shipment.  One of the major outcomes of the project was proving that the optimal policy generated by the mathematical model is of simple form, i.e., a time of day for each inventory level and session combination beyond which new vials should not be opened.  Several enhancements to the base model were considered, including establishing a minimum number of guaranteed hours of vaccination at the beginning of each session; allowing patients to return the following morning for guaranteed vaccination; and allowing patient arrivals patterns to depend on time of day and session number.  We also developed a simulation model of a clinic to explore performance metrics outside the scope of the mathematical model.\n\nAdditional outcomes of the project include extensive numerical analysis on the effect of various factors (vial size, session frequency, inventory stock levels) on the optimal policy and its performance; the degree to which the optimal policy outperforms current practice and other ad hoc policies; and potential improvements and annual cost savings extrapolated across multiple countries.  These analyses have generated a multitude of insights including general rules for clinicians to determine an agreeable combination of parameters (e.g., number of sessions per cycle and guaranteed hours of vaccination) to achieve often competing objectives.  An approach was developed to determine an approximate policy that is easier to implement; the resulting policies appear to perform quite well.  For measles alone, country-wide and world-wide extrapolations indicate potential improvements in coverage on the order of millions of doses per year at no additional cost, or, under a minimum coverage rate of 95%, an annual savings on the order of millions of dollars.  Lastly, because many of our findings were context specific, we also developed a web-based decision support tool, the Vaccine Clinic Reconstitution Optimizer (VaCRO), that enables clinicians and other users to conduct analyses tailored to their particular setting by solving for an optimal administration policy using the mathematical model.\n\nFunding for this project supported a woman doctoral student's dissertation work as well as a minority undergraduate assistant.  The results of the project have been published in two top journals, a third paper is currently under revision and a..."
