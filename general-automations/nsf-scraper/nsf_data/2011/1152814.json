The role of this technology in science education is largely unexplored, although the values of kinesthetic learning and technology-mediated instruction are recognized.  The target population is middle school science students.  The tool focuses on the study of earth science concepts including plate tectonics. The combined tool will be assessed in multiple settings including K-12 classrooms, museums, home-school environments, and in special-needs groups.   The project involves university faculty, undergraduates, teachers and other educators, and students with roles in tool development, both tangible and cyberinfrastructure and assessment.",

The internet offers teachers and learners incredible amounts of information (animations, models, reports) to convey required content materials.  The availability of these resources leads to a number of questions including;\n\nWhat is the best way to use these resources?\n\nWhat is the best way to find relevant resources?\n\nHow can relevant resources be integrated into a lesson plan for the day's goals to be met?\n\nHow much should this information replace other methods of learning, including traditional reading and writing and model-building?\n\nThis grant examined ways to address these questions while recognizing inherent limitations within the education system including teacher time and training, cost, and well-defined curricula.  \n\nThe content focus of these efforts was the theory of plate tectonics, the idea that 250 million years ago, all the continents were once one, called Pangea.
