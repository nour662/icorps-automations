 "awd_abstract_narration": "Invasive species pose risks to people (e.g., economic, health) and wildlife (e.g., competition, predation). They also pose ecological risks to the diversity of communities and ecosystems. Little is currently known about public attitudes about and tolerance for the risks associated with invasive animals. To address this gap, this research studies the perceived risks associated with feral cats, an invasive, charismatic species, numbering over 25 million in the U.S., and strongly associated with people. The method used in the research is a quantitative mail survey of stakeholders and the public in Florida. \r\n \r\nThis study advances the theoretical understanding of risk perceptions including the factors contributing to perceptions of direct and ecological risk. The study compares risk perceptions among stakeholders and between stakeholders and the public. The results of this research will enhance management options to minimize the risk of predation and competition for native and threatened wildlife; minimize the potential spread of zoonotic diseases from feral cats to pets and people; and reduce instances of nuisance behaviors: the fouling of yards and open space, killing of birds or ornamental fish and damage to gardens. While this research focuses on one species, the findings will provide insight into the relationship between risk perceptions, tolerance, and attitudes that will influence the management and conservation of other invasive domestic and wild species.",
