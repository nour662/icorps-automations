 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a collaborative effort involving Texas Tech University, Missouri University of Science and Technology, and University of Texas - Pan American.  It is developing a suite of multimedia educational materials and supporting mechanisms to create a knowledge-centered learning environment for the undergraduate instruction of stochastic processes and applied probability that seamlessly integrates into the curriculum.  This project is creating high-quality video clips that challenge students to solve real problems from industry in collaborative settings.  These videos are being posted on a project website along with other supporting material consisting of wiki-style tutorials and problem-solving software. A Facebook page for the project is being created to support a \"wall\" where students may collaboratively work on active problems and tangentially develop professional skills, such as teaming and communication. The investigators are anticipating that students at other location, even without their instructors directing them, will visit the site and will learn through the knowledge-centered aspects of the wiki-style resources, \"wall\" discussions, and review of active and archived problems.  The team is making sure that students from underrepresented groups are featured in the videos in an effort to increase the interest among these groups of students.  The project is using a few external faculty members as a design review team to provide guidance, and an experienced outside evaluator is using surveys and tests to monitor progress toward the learning outcomes and data on website and Facebook visits to monitor participation.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of the project's products through the website postings and the use of social networking and the focus on broadening the participation of underrepresented groups.",

These computational tools are included into the learning website www.stochasticchallenge.org.\nThe larger project consists of breating a learning environment to support the teaching of stochastic processes with an emphasis on conceptual learning versus the mathematical rigor.

Specifically, these questions describe how the website has been more effective in teaching students in the use probability models in their efforts to perform system optimization. The following questions are answered:\n\nWhat benefit did the resources and online calculators provide?\n\nThe benefit of the calculators is that the students are able to formulate the problems as well as solve them. Due to the complexity of these problems, solving them by a calculator (by hand) is highly impractical. This is impracticality comes from having to derive probabilities from data, result in a large system of equations, or require numerous calculations to derive a simple result. The calculators allow the student to focus on modeling and skip the tedious calculations. This allowed the student to focus on modeling and solution analysis, and reduces the tediousness to attain a result.\n\nHow did the work change your academic environment - courses, curricula, student outcomes, etc.?\n\nThe calculators and the stochasticchallenge.org website have provided a set of real world examples that can be used in teaching. Specifically, the calculators have changed the courses in that student performance is now determined by their modeling skills more than on their capability to attain the correct numeric solution. The calculators allow students to perform high-level calculations, which have removed the checking of basic skills such as algebra, numerical operations, and data manipulation. The grading is now determined by the modeling of the problem. Thus, is the model an effective abstraction of the problem provided in the examples? The student outcomes are now more focused on their logical formulation of the problem and identifying the correct modeling tool, technique, or methodology for eac..."
