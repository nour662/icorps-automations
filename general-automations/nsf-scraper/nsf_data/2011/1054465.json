 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to quantify the material behavior of liquid crystal polymer networks that change their shape in response to light. This research will provide a new understanding of complex photomechanical behavior and facilitate the future design of adaptive structures with unprecedented characteristics. Recent experiments have demonstrated high performance, light induced shape changes; however, the interactions between the polymer network and liquid crystals are poorly understood. Material models that can correlate polymer network interactions with complex liquid crystal microstructure and light absorption are critical to understand these materials. Predictions of the photoelastomer mechanics will be formulated, simulated, and compared with experiments. Experiments will include quantifying photo-induced molecular evolution using solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and actuator size effects on photomechanical efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe creation of new knowledge on the mechanics of liquid crystal polymer networks is expected to have broad implications on developing actuators driven directly by light, including robotic manipulators, microfluidics, energy harvesting, and adaptive optics. In addition, the educational objectives will include research integration into the curriculum by creating a remote Web-based active materials laboratory and course, an active materials Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program, and a K-12 program at the Mary Brogan Museum of Art and Science. The museum program will include a hands-on exhibit of a smart structure wind tunnel model. Under-represented minorities will also be heavily recruited through the joint engineering program between Florida State University and Florida A&M University (a Historical Black College and University).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project outcomes for this research have advanced our understanding of the material behavior of photomechanical responses in liquid crystal elastomers and glassy polymers.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThis research led to a description of how light is absorbed in polymers containing a photo-responsive molecule azobenzene to produce a change in the shape of films.  These films are on the scale of insect wings and are envisioned for a variety of adaptive structure applications where light is advantageous to control motion of a polymer.  The shape changing process occurs as specific molecules known as azobenzene absorb light and change their molecular shape (conformation).  During this process, the light responding molecules transmit forces to the surrounding polymer matrix which leads to a geometric change of shape.  Importantly, if the light is polarized, the photo-responsive molecules change shape in different ways which allows for the polymer geometry to be controlled by rotating the polarization of light.  The motion of the insect size wings may bend toward or away from the light or twist.  We used multi-physics theory, computer modeling, and experiments to study this phenomena.  Theory and computer modeling focused on coupling the high speed light waves with picosecond photoisomerization (e.g., light induced chemical reactions) of azobenzene molecules and microsecond to minutes of polymer deformation motion.  Experiments at the molecular level were carried out using solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and compared to macroscopic measurements of forces, light intensity, and heat in the polymer simultaneously.  \n\nThe results have provided important insight into how azobenzene should be synthesized within a polymer network to achieve a desired coupling between light excitation and shape change.  We demonstrated how the local molecular shape change leads to macroscopic polymer deformation in both soft (elastomeric) materials and glassy (stiff) polymers.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe aim of this project was to learn how the reusable energy of light can be used to deformed polymers such that they can be used to create work (i.e., novel motors, machines, and light sensors and switches).  Given this opportunity, our research group worked with Sandia National Laboratory to benchmark the performance of these materials as an automative feedback control system to move an array of small heliostat mirrors which all reflect light to a power tower.  In turn, the heat from the reflected light is absorbed by molten salt that creates energy from steam.  Other opportunities were explored including changing the texture of these photopolymer films such that they can manipulate the flow within the region very close to an aircraft control surface.  Several students were mentored including undergraduate students, graduate students, K-12 students, and high school teachers.  Two female undergraduate students won several best poster awards based on this research.

One additional undergraduate female student was also a co-author on a journal paper in the Journal of Applied Physics which showcased her research.  All of these students who have graduated have gone on to successful jobs in industry including one PhD student who has started a company developing new finite element software.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/19/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William S Oates"
