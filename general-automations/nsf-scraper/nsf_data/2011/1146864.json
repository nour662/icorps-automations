Specifically, the award provides support to approximately ten students for travel, housing, conference fees, and other costs incidental to participating in the two day climate science conference.  \r\n\r\nThis graduate student organized conference is now in its fifth year and is a good venue for early career scientists to exchange ideas, formally and informally, on climate research and to foster interdisciplinary interactions.  The general science topics planned for the meeting include paleoclimatology, atmosphere/ocean dynamics, biogeochemical cycles, the cryosphere, clouds/aerosols, climate forcing and feedbacks, and the biosphere.  A unique feature of this year's conference is the attendance of advanced undergraduate science students.  The abstract for all presentations made at the conference will be published online at MIT and archived for two years.",
