 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Panama award provides funding for U.S. participation in a planning workshop that will take place in Panama City in January, 2012 to chart the future of Environmental Studies at the Liquid Jungle Laboratory (LJL). This award will enable approximately 10 U.S. researchers to attend the workshop, together with an equivalent number of Latin American and European participants.  The goal of the workshop is to discuss options and plan future strategy and programs to support sustained research and education at LJL. The Laboratory is in an especially attractive region for integrated tropical research due to an extraordinary combination of natural geographic settings (terrestrial, coastal, and oceanographic) and strong bimodal (wet-dry) seasonality. The U.S. participants are associated with institutions such as the Woods Hole Consortium, Roger Williams University, Conservation International, and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI). Foreign participants are expected from the University of Panama, University of Costa Rica, the Natural Environmental Authority in Panama, the Catholic University of Chile, and research universities and agencies in Spain.\r\n\r\nAmong the results of this workshop is expected to be a series of planned major activities that should enhance the long-term research and education goals of the Liquid Jungle Laboratory.  Having a site to study and evaluate changes in diversity that result from climate change in a tropical system is highly desirable.  The education and training opportunities for junior researchers at such a site would be significant and would satisfy a major goal of the Office of International Science and Engineering, to provide young scientists with opportunities to conduct research in an international setting.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded by Americas Program in the Office of International Science and Engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe workshop funded by this award was organized by scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Marine Biological Laboratory and held at the Liquid Jungle Lab on the Island of Isla Canales de Tierra off the Pacific coast of Panama.  The workshop was attended by 17 scientists from four countries (Chile, Panama, Spain, and the U.S.), representing 11 academic and government institutions.  The goal of the workshop was to define the medium and long-term research and education objectives that would effectively use the natural environments and facilities available at the Liquid Jungle Lab to make significant contributions to terrestrial and marine tropical ecology along the Pacific coast of central America. The workshop included formal presentations, discussions and field trips around general themes of research, infrastructure and education.  A summary of outcomes for each of these three themes follows.\n\nResearch:  Specific topics addressed included the oceanography of the Gulf of Chiriqui and its effects on coastal ecosystems.  Of particular interest was the role that upwelling, internal tides and salinity variations may influence the resilience of corals to temperature and natural acidification conditions along the Pacific coast of Panama.  There was also considerable discussion of the ecological services provided by mangrove ecosystems in Pacific Panama, including the importance of these habitats to commercial and artisanal fisheries.  Finally, the intersection of conservation actions with economic and social development in Pacific Panama was also discussed.  Important questions included what are the impacts on local communities and economies of large-scale development for tourism as a mechanism for coastal conservation?\n\nInfrastructure:  The workshop participants were charged with a review and possible restructuring of LJL internal administration and operating model.  Recommendations included the establishment of consortium status with STRI and SENACYT labs in the region, and with planned resort development.  There was also discussion of a cross-isthmus observing network for long term marine and coastal environmental studies.  Such a network would include a WHOI-STRI collaboration on installation of ocean observatories at Liquid Jungle Laboratory and Bocas del Toro Laboratory, and integration into the Smithsonian MarineGEO network in Panama and future Smithsonian sites.\n\nEducation: Several opportunities for expanding the use of LJL for teaching and training were noted during the workshop.  These include an expansion of field courses in tropical ecology (marine and/or terrestrial) for undergraduate and graduate students from US and Latin American universities and participation with LINCGlobal program in Chile and University of Panama for capacity building in environmental management.\n\nFollow-up action will be undertaken by participants in the workshop, with a goal for submission of 2-4 research proposals in 2012, funding for the observing network, establishment of the LINCGlobal partnership, expansion of other course offerings, and enhancement of LJL operations.\n\n \n\n\n\nParticipants in the 2012 LJL Planning Workshop.
