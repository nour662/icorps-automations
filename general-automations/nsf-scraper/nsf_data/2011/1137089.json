 "awd_abstract_narration": "1137089\r\nIsmagilov\r\nThis project aims to develop a rigorous engineering framework to enhance understanding of interspecies\r\nand interkingdom signaling in order to enable building of \"microbiome in a pill\" particles precisely\r\nengineered, spatially structured microbial communities encapsulated in a biocompatible material to\r\nultimately prevent and treat human diseases associated with dysbiosis (microbial imbalance). This\r\nengineering framework will enable prediction and control of interspecies signaling and interactions both in\r\nvitro and in vivo by solving four challenges: Goal 1 (MIKS1a): Use computational methods to predict, for\r\na given desired function, which specific microbes are needed and which spatial structures are required to\r\nachieve that function. Goal 2 (MIKS1b and MIKS2): Develop in vitro microfluidic technologies and\r\nassociated design principles to understand signaling by rapidly characterizing and measuring the impact\r\nof spatial structure on the complex molecular interactions that underlie signaling, and host cells? response\r\nto signaling. Goal 3 (MIKS2 and MIKS3): Develop and test design principles for the scale up of spatially\r\npre-structured microbial communities, discovered and characterized in Goals 1 and 2, to enable\r\nproduction of engineered functional communities in gram quantities needed for in vivo testing. Goal 4\r\n(MIKS2 and MIKS3): By using communities produced in Goal 3, and by gavaging them into germ-free\r\nand gnotobiotic mice, measure in vivo the function of the community and the host's response, and iterate\r\nwith Goals 1-3 to develop a set of design rules that enable rational engineering of spatially pre-structured\r\n\"microbiome in a pill\" particles that predictably function in vivo in a mammalian gut.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The importance of multi-species and inter-kingdom systems and their signaling is\r\nwidely appreciated but general engineering approaches for control of such systems are urgently needed.\r\nThis project proposes that signaling and interactions can be precisely engineered via a biomimetic\r\napproach control of spatial structure. This is a potentially transformative shift in understanding how\r\nsignaling, metabolic exchange, and function of communities are controlled. The mammalian microbiome\r\nis an excellent test system because it contains a diverse number of species interacting with one another\r\nand the host. This work will lay the foundation for a new engineering paradigm, a \"microbiome in a pill\",\r\nand establish design principles for controlling signaling and metabolic exchange within the community,\r\nbetween the community and competitors, and between the community and the host. Engineering\r\ncommunities with spatial structure may close important gaps in understanding the mechanisms of\r\ndysbiosis and manipulating communities affected by dysbiosis, ultimately leading to more effective\r\nprophylactics and treatments for human disease. The assembled team is well-qualified to carry out the\r\nproposed work: The PI has expertise in microfluidic technology development, and analysis and modeling\r\nof complex networks in biological contexts. Co-PIs Meyer and Henry are experts in automated annotation\r\nof metagenomic datasets and in using these annotations to create and analyze genome-scale metabolic\r\nmodels. Co-PIs Chervonsky and Mazmanian are experts in the use of germ-free and gnotobiotic animal\r\nmodels to understand the impact of microbiota in the mammalian gut on the host immune system.\r\nBroader Impact: Ultimately, the simple yet precisely engineered \"microbiome in a pill\" communities\r\ndesigned in this work could dramatically improve quality of life and reduce healthcare costs by modulating\r\ndysbiosis in the context of conditions affecting millions of Americans: IBD, infections, diabetes,\r\nautoimmune conditions, and obesity. This approach may pioneer new solutions for problems where\r\ngenetically modified microorganisms are not acceptable or feasible. The design rules for building\r\nfunctional microbial communities developed here should have broad impact outside of human health, with\r\nthe potential to address numerous issues facing society today, including environmental contaminants,\r\nclimate, and food and fuel production, which are all strongly impacted by the function of microbial\r\ncommunities. The project will provide education, training, and mentoring for graduate and undergraduate\r\nstudents and postdoctoral scholars, enhanced by the PI's excellent track record in mentoring students.\r\nThis project will also provide researchers with numerous tools to study and use microbial communities for\r\nspecific functions. Co-PIs Meyer and Henry have extensive track records in disseminating computational\r\nmethods and tools, and the PI has an excellent track record of disseminating knowledge via high-impact\r\npublications and partnerships with industry. This project will support public outreach through REEL\r\nScience, hands-on science for K-12 curriculum development through CalTech Classroom Connection,\r\nand research training for teachers and high school students through the Summer Research Connection.",
