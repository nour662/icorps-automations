 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Center for Welding Education and Training (Weld-Ed) is a national partnership between the welding and materials joining industry and the nation's community and technical colleges and universities that is dedicated to expanding the role and pipeline of welding technicians in the industry.  Weld-Ed brings together the American Welding Society (AWS), industry partners Lockheed Martin and Lincoln Electric, 140 business/industry affiliates, 66 educational affiliates, and ten Regional Center Partners.  This project has the following goals: 1) Develop a national welding educators' certificate program; 2) Expand professional development for welding faculty in new technologies including blended learning, virtual simulation, and new and emerging welding processes; 3) Expand and increase the effectiveness of the Center and its Regional Partners Network to address market-driven needs, including regional welding technician specialization, and the use of distance learning applications in sharing curricula between institutions and in delivering coursework; and, 4) Develop and implement a strategy to deliver technical assistance and consulting services to community and technical colleges, universities, K-12 school districts and the welding industry.\r\n\r\nThe Center activities enable other community and technical colleges in the U.S. to partner with their local K-12 school districts, adult education and institutions of higher education to expand welding technician education in their area. Many of those same institutions as well as two-year colleges that are currently offering welding technician education are able to add welding specializations that better meet the needs of their regional welding employers. The project enhances and expands professional development opportunities for welding educators by developing a national welding education certificate program and a master welding educator certificate that can be offered by current and future Weld-Ed partners throughout the U.S.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWeld-Ed strived to improve the quality of education and training services to address the hiring and professional development needs of the welding industry.  To accomplish its mission, the Center, along with its ten Regional Partner two- and-four-year member colleges, and industry partners, worked collaboratively on the development of new and improved curricula in all areas of welding.  As a result of these efforts, faculty and instructors were provided continuing education opportunities at Regional Partners throughout the country.  These programs were specifically designed to train the next generation of workers for the materials joining industry and to upgrade the skills of existing workers.\n\nWeld-Ed\u00c6s goals were to: Increase the number of welding technicians to meet ongoing workforce needs through recruitment efforts; Improve the education of associate degree students in welding technology through curriculum model development and enhancement; Design and deliver professional development for welding educators; Conduct research on education and employment trends in welding.\n\nSo what has Weld-Ed been up to?  Answer: Making Sparks.  The following will show how Weld-Ed is sparking development, sparking interest, sparking a following, sparking a call to action, and is sparking achievement through its 10 Regional Partner institutions.\n\nSparking Development: To reach as many students as efficiently possible, Weld-Ed created and piloted two new faculty professional development training modules, continued offering the four cornerstone modules at partner colleges, converted the four cornerstone modules for blended delivery, and expanded the annual National Welding Educators Conference at FABTECH, a prominent industry trade show.  0ver 500 welding instructors have participated in 1 or more of these professional development modules through 2014, reaching 40 states and over 30,000 students.  \n\nSparking Interest:  In partnership with the American Welding Society and Lincoln Electric, Weld-Ed launched the Careers-In Welding Mobile Exhibit featuring virtual reality welding simulators.  This award winning 650 square foot recruitment trailer featuring a career wall, interactive displays and hands on virtual reality arc welding has attended 37 events and reached over 115,000 people in 27 States since 2012.\n\nThe Society of Women Engineers Collegiate Interest Group was established at Lorain County Community College, the first ever community college to host this group, by Weld-Ed Project Manager Ramona Anand.\n\nThe \"Women of Gases &amp; Welding\" initiative was launched in 2012 in partnership with the American Welding Society and GAWDA (Gas and Welding Distributors Association).  The group\u00c6s mission is to enhance the success of women in the gases and welding industries.  Strategic planning and marketing committees have been established.  Networking events with over 100 women in attendance have been held at the GAWDA semi-annual meetings and FABTECH since 2012.  Three new national scholarships, awarding $10,000 annually have been endowed since 2013 and are targeted at young women pursuing welding technology and welding engineering education.\n\nSparking a Following:  Weld-Ed has over 2,000 Facebook fans, over 1,300 followers on Twitter, nearly 100 followers and over 10,000 views on Google plus and also has a presence on LinkedIn.  Weld-Ed has over 150 educational affiliates. \n\nSparking a Call to Action:  The Welding Industry Roundtable sponsored by The American Welding Society and Weld-Ed was held at Crowne Plaza Chicago O\u00c6Hare on September 9th, 2011. This focus group event was attended by 16 executive panelists and 70 audience participants. Small group discussion topics included: Employer sponsored education, common core competencies with career pathways grounded in basic academics for success, improving the image of the industry to parents/counselors/teachers, identifying new pipelines, leveraging experienced talent in new strategies to train the nex..."
