 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID research project will examine ecosystem and biogeochemical impacts of a 200-year flood of the Mississippi River along a transect from the Atchafalaya River, which is receiving massive inputs of water from the Morganza Spillway in addition to already high flood waters, to the Atchafalaya River Delta Estuary, to the northern Gulf of Mexico. The researchers will focus on how an extreme event in a river system having extensive interaction with wetlands and floodplain swamps alters carbon quality, nutrients, and sediment transport to the Gulf, as well as how these biogeochemical changes affect ecosystem respiration and the food web.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the research include contributions to human resource development and to management issues. The project will interface with an existing Research Experience for Undergraduates program, affording students an opportunity to gain first-hand experience studying an extreme event in a floodplain river. Because extreme events such as this are expected to become more common in the future, this study will provide important information to managers, who currently must make decisions about river and flood management based on limited knowledge of the ecosystem effects of this type of event.",

Rosenheim, Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Tulane University\n\nNSF Award Number: 1141410\n\n \n\n            In response to the record high water event on the Mississippi River during the spring of 2011, a collaborative team of scientists from Tulane University and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) was awarded NSF funding to sample river water, sediment carried by the river water, and sediment in cores from the river and delta bottoms from the Atchafalaya distributary of the Mississippi River system (Figure 1). Our team used a time series of such sampling through the 2011 flood hydrograph to amass a valuable record of biogeochemistry, carbon cycling and sediment dynamics during this rare event. More detailed reports on sediment dynamics and biogeochemistry will be released by LUMCON in the future; this report deals mainly with radiocarbon age spectra of the river sediment and associated biogeochemistry.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFigure   1*:   Aerial photographs showing sampling locations   continuously sampled by Brian Roberts\u00c6 ARDE research unit at LUMCON.  Red sites were focused on for the carbon   cycling elements of the current project.    Inset shows location of large map relative to lower Mississippi and   Atchafalaya River drainages. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThe most important aspect of this funding is that important samples were collected at high frequency during a rare event (Figure 2), and these samples tie into a &gt;60 month monitoring period initiated by Brian Roberts\u00c6 ARDE research team.  Analyses are ongoing.  Below is a progress report on the three facets of this project, as well as ongoing work that will result in several publications.   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure   2*:  Left:    Mississippi River hydrograph (red) from Tarbert Landing gauge over   timespan between 2008 and 2012.    Although these years have seen several large high water events, the   2011 event stands out more than 2 standard deviations (grey lines) above the   mean discharge (black line).  The area   between the grey lines encompasses 99% of the discharge levels observed at   Tarbert Landing since the 1950\u00c6s; floods extending outside of that area are   statistically unique.  Right:  Select sampling days during the flood (red   points on thick black 2011 hydrograph line), corresponding to samples which   were analyzed for radiocarbon age distributions.  Mean flow (thin black) as well daily minima   and maxima (grey dashed lines) are shown. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBiogeochemistry:  Total suspended sediment loads during over 60 months of previous monitoring were highest during the 2011 high water event (Figure 3).  At the same time, respiration rates deviated significantly from a previously derived temperature relationship, indicating higher respiration rates (Figure 3).  This resulted in the lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations (&lt;55.6% saturation) in the monitoring period observed during the 2011 high water event.  The change in biogeochemistry resulted from alleviation of carbon limitation in the river by the large mass of additional carbon moving downstream during the event.  The goal of using ramped pyrolysis radiocarbon dating on these suspended sediments is to ascertain the age spectrum of the riverine carbon and how it changes due to biogeochemical interactions during such an event.\n\nRadiocarbon Age Spectra:  Similar to the 2008 high water event, the carbon being transported downstream in the 2011 high water event was older.  However, like 2008, the changes in age distribution were small relative to possible range of ages in the entire basin (Rosenheim et al., 2013, open access link).  Most impressively, age spectra above and below the halocline (salinity boundary between river water and Gulf of Mexico water) were quite ..."
