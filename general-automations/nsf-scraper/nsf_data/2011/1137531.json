This initiative will design and implement an interdisciplinary urban environmental studies concentration which will span four disciplines: biology/biochemistry, computer science, urban studies/policies, and applied mathematics. The project will support the creation of two courses (an introductory urban environmental studies course and an applied environmental microbiology course), student-driven research projects, and an open-source platform (EnviroThursday) for exchange between the Dillard community, city officials and city planners, and the public.\r\n \r\nThe objectives of the project are: to develop two courses which will orient students to current trends in urban ecosystems and prepare them for graduate study in the field of environmental studies;  to modify URB335 Geographic Information Systems to better equip students with the skill sets to conduct research in the field of environmental science; to design an Interdisciplinary Urban Environmental Studies concentration that will lead to interdisciplinary certification in conjunction with Dillard's Deep South Center for Environmental Justice; and to engage undergraduates in environmental research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The Dillard University Targeted Infusion Project, WATER (Water Alliance for Training in Environmental Research), dramatically increased the number of Dillard University\u00c6s undergraduates who pursued the biology environmental track and persisted to graduation through a transformative, culturally-sensitive interdisciplinary immersion, infused with experiential learning, dedicated mentorship, and wraparound support services. As a direct consequence, the Dillard WATER project produced a cohort of underrepresented students who are capable of working effectively and energetically at the interfaces of computer sciences, life sciences and engineering to solve the problems of the 21st century. WATER doubled the current production rate of environmental concentrators at Dillard University. Intriguingly, WATER is one of few programs that used the Hurricane Katrina disaster site as a laboratory to provide students an unparalleled experience to grapple with issues that threaten the resiliency of historic port cities like New Orleans and, more importantly, devise and use robust methodologies to explore the impact of natural disasters on the biodiversity of ecosystems. The project is directly responsible for a seismic-shift in undergraduate training that engages students in discovery-based learning to explore the environmental issues of the 21st century. These efforts culminated in the successful launch of Dillard University's undergraduate Interdisciplinary Urban Environmental Studies concentration/certificate program. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/07/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ruby Broadway"
