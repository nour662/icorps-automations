 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit. Maize leaves consist of an upper photosynthetic blade separated at the ligule region from a lower enclosing sheath. Mutations that remove or alter the ligule region reduce the angle of the blade relative to the sheath, causing the leaves to extend upright. The ligule region thus helps to determine plant shape, and understanding how the structure develops will provide new tools for crop improvement. The ligule region is visible early in development at a restricted site, called a pre-ligule band, marked initially by increased cell division, cell expansion and localized gene expression. A fluorescent marker for an auxin carrier protein also localizes to the pre-ligule band, suggesting a role for hormone signaling in establishing the site. To understand the mechanism of ligule development, a collection of fluorescent markers will be used to map sequential changes in expression during early ligule development. Gene expression profiles in the pre-ligule region will be generated using laser capture microdissection followed by RNA sequencing. Three regions along the leaf axis will be captured, including the pre-ligule band itself, adjoining blade and subtending sheath tissue. Normal plants will be compared to mutants to identify expression changes on a genomic level when ligule growth is altered. Bioinformatic tools will be used to select candidate genes from these expression catalogs for further study. The selected genes will be validated by qRT-PCR, and their expression patterns studied by whole mount in situ hybridization. This research will identify the sequential and potentially interacting factors needed to make a ligule and will offer new genetic tools for manipulating leaf shape. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts. Leaf blade angle is an important agronomic trait in grain crops, such as maize. Plants with more upright leaves, caused by changes in ligule structure, may have higher crop yield if optimal photosynthesis can occur in less space. Maize ligule mutants are also excellent tools for teaching students about developmental genetics and genomics. The project will provide summer research opportunities specifically to Community College students and will develop Community College teaching modules in collaboration with education programs established at the University of Wyoming (UW). The teaching modules will be assessed using methods developed at the Science Math Teaching Center at UW and disseminated through UW to participating Community Colleges. Research data and teaching modules will be posted at a project website and made available to the research community and general public.",

It is thus more important than ever that scientists perform the basic underpinning research that can be used by breeders for crop improvement. Understanding how plants grow and function will help breeders devise ways to make crops more resilient and grow more efficiently and sustainably.\n\nThis project focused on understanding the basics of how corn leaves develop. Young leaves emerge progressively during plant development from a stem-cell like region called the shoot meristem. Once initiated, the uniform leaf is gradually subdivided into functionally distinct parts: the lower part of the leaf is a rigid enclosing sheath that helps hold the plant upright. Projecting out from the sheath is the flat photosynthetic blade that captures energy from the sun to produce carbohydrates. The critical boundary between the upper blade and lower sheath is defined by unique cells in a so-called ligule region, which acts as a hinge to angle the blade towards the sun. This blade/sheath boundary is an agriculturally important trait with two competing outcomes: projecting the blade out to capture sun energy effectively results in a wide plant that takes space to grow. Understanding what controls the growth of the ligule region at the blade/sheath boundary will help inform breeding decisions about balancing space constraints with photosynthetic output. The project also addresses a fundamental biological question about the very nature of how cells acquire identity.\n\nBlade angle is controlled genetically by changing the architecture of the ligule region. If ligule-specific genes are absent or expressed improperly in a mutant, the ligule region does not grow normally, resulting in upright blades. Using these mutants and normal plants, cells from the ligule region were captured at different stages of development. Genomic methods were then used to sequence all the genes expressed locally in the captured cell types of normal and mutant plants. Data analysis uncovered a suite of genes that are turned on and off and apparently function in the narrow region that gives rise to the ligule boundary; and these very same genes are also expressed in other regions of the plant that have angled outgrowths, such as where the leaf inserts in the meristem and in the tassel and ear. This discovery supported the idea that the earliest determinants of form are shared among organ types and even across grasses, based on comparative genomics.  Data generation, analysis and interpretation involved an interdisciplinary group of researchers including students, post-doctoral researchers, teachers and researchers. By producing a rich dataset available for public use (eg. http://www.qteller.com/), the project outcomes are amplified by any researcher or breeder who would like to mine the data for future research or for targeted genetic or breeding goals.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cynthia Weinig"
