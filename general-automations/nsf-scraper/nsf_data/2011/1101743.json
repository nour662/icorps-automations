 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is aimed at modeling the diffusion of information online and empirically discriminating among models of mechanisms driving the spread of memes. We explore why some ideas cause viral explosions while others are quickly forgotten. Our analysis goes beyond the traditional approach of applied epidemic diffusion processes and focuses on cascade size distributions and popularity time series in order to model the agents and processes driving the online diffusion of information, including: users and their topical interests, competition for user attention, and the chronological age of information. Completion of our project will result in a better understanding of information flow and could assist in elucidating the complex mechanisms that underlie a variety of human dynamics and organizations. The analysis will involve studying meme diffusion in large-scale social media by collecting and analyzing massive streams of public micro-blogging data.\r\n\r\nThe project stands to benefit both the research community and the public significantly. Our data will be made available via APIs and include information on meme propagation networks, statistical data, and relevant user and content features. The open-source platform we develop will be made publicly available and will be extensible to ever more research areas as a greater preponderance of human activities are replicated online. Additionally, we will create a web service open to the public for monitoring trends, bursts, and suspicious memes. This service could mitigate the diffusion of false and misleading ideas, detect hate speech and subversive propaganda, and assist in the preservation of open debate.",

OSoMe comprises hardware and software infrastructure with Web tools that provide end-users with the power to analyze online trends and visualize temporal, geographic, and network patterns of spreading memes and bursts of viral activity. We also provide an API to help other researchers expand upon the tools, or create \"mash-ups\" with other data sources. For example, we released a mash-up allowing others to study how social bots manipulate online discourse on any topic. The OSoMe applications and APIs provide an easy way to access insights about meme diffusion in social media from a growing collection of 70+ billion public tweets to date.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another research goal was to understand how social media can be abused to manipulate public opinion.

In June and July 2016, our work on social bots was featured on the covers of the two top computing publications: <em>IEEE Computer</em> and <em>Communications of the ACM</em>.
