 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is funded to continue study of plasma waves and radiation that play key roles in controlling the charged particle transport, loss rates, and energy exchange in the Earth's magnetosphere. These waves also directly or remotely sense space plasma processes, structures, and boundaries that interact with the solar wind plasma flow. Operating a digital radio receiver (100 KHz -5 MHz) at the South Pole station in the Antarctic will answer some outstanding questions regarding the fine structure of above radio emission: What is the relationship between the recently discovered fine structures of low frequency (LF) auroral hiss and middle-frequency (MF) burst: two types of radio emissions that occur together at the onset of the auroral substorm? Are the LF auroral hiss and auroral MF burst correlated or anti-correlated temporally and spatially on sub-second time scales? Are structured \"AKR-like\" emissions at 150-750 kHz, which superficially resemble the Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR), evidence of transmission of AKR to ground level? Preliminary comparisons between South Pole radio data and corresponding data from the Geotail satellite deep in the Earth's magnetotail suggest a good correlation between AKR and the ground-level \"AKR-like\" events, which if confirmed will support previously ignored theories of mode conversion and downward propagation of AKR. The proposed experiments must be performed in the Antarctic, because critical portions of the LF/MF radio environment are impossible to observe at Northern Hemisphere locations due to man-made electromagnetic interference. This proposal will provide education and training to both the undergraduate and graduate students at Dartmouth College, forming the major part of a PhD dissertation. It will also provide the basis for multiple undergraduate internships. Researchers at Dartmouth College will participate in public outreach as a part of this work, including public talks or visits to schools.",

With National Science Foundation support in 2010-2014, Dartmouth College researchers erected new antennas on a 30-foot mast (pictured), larger than previously used, to follow up observations of Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR), the most intense natural radio emission in Earth's environment, until recently observed only from space. Observations of polarization and fine structure of the radio emissions using the new instrument at South Pole bolster the conclusion that a small portion of these intense outgoing radio waves somehow leak back into the Earth's atmosphere to be detectable on the ground. The mechanism by which this happens is as yet unknown, but significant because it could affect other waves besides AKR, and because AKR detected on the ground could provide a powerful new method to monitor and study the aurora. In addition to these important studies of AKR, using the same instruments Dartmouth scientists discovered and described an entirely new type of auroral radio emission at 1.3-1.8 MHz, just above a critical ionospheric resonance frequency called the electron cyclotron frequency. The mechanism for this new emission is as yet unknown but significant because it could occur more widely in the space environment and may provide a basis for remotely sensing space physics processes. Finally, the same instruments at South Pole have been used to study new aspects of a well-known auroral radio emission called auroral \"hiss,\" named for the sound it makes when played through a loudspeaker. Nighttime auroral hiss has been widely studied, but Dartmouth scientists investigated and described daytime auroral hiss which was previously poorly known. It turns out, there are at least two types of daytime auroral hiss, one occurring primarily before noon and bearing an interesting relationship to the relative orientation of the Earth's and sun's magnetic fields, and the other occurring primarily after noon and more similar to the well-known nighttime auroral hiss. Taken together, these discoveries about auroral radio emissions open up new areas of research to understand how they are generated and how they propagate within the Earth's space environment. The results of these studies are significant because they illuminate the physics explaining aurora, provide new ways of measuring and studying aurora, and apply to a range of similar wave phenomena which occur in Earth's environment as well as that of the sun and the other magnetized planets. In addition to these scientific outcomes, the work performed at Dartmouth College with NSF support during 2010-2014 provided training and education, including field work exprience, to three graduate students and multiple undergraduate students, with the work performed under this grant forming the major part of one PhD thesis and one Masters thesis.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/31/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;W&nbsp;Labelle</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/...",
