 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how speciation happens is a long-standing and exciting challenge in biology. Zones of secondary contact, or areas where previously-isolated lineages meet and interact, are one way to test hypotheses and theories about speciation. This study investigates a unique system in the Australian rainforest, in which there are over twenty overlapping zones of secondary contact. This study considers four such contacts within a closely-related group of lizards to investigate patterns of introgression, or gene exchange, across the zone. In particular, this study examines how evolutionary forces, such as demographic processes and selection, influence introgression, and more generally, the evolution of barriers between species. To test these predictions, high-throughput sequencing will be used to develop genomic resources, and fine-scale sampling and genotyping of populations in the contact zone will be used to measure rates of introgression.\r\n\r\nThis research will serve as an excellent vehicle to engage with students and to conduct outreach activities. Undergraduate students in both the United States and Australia will develop their own independent laboratory and field projects related to this project.  Additionally, this research will be shared with underserved middle school and community college students through outreach programs. Finally, this research will generate new genomic and bioinformatic tools for use by the greater research community.",

One way to understand how these genomes have diverged is to investigate interactions between populations that were once isolated and are now meeting again. When these populations meet and breed, they will start to exchange genes. In this work, we are interested in understanding what are the factors that influence how far the genes travel. To study this, we look at four cases in Australian lizards where populations have split and are now coming back together. Interestingly, unlike many other similar tudies, the lizards in these diverged populations look identical despite the fact that they have diverged for anywhere from 3 to 5.8 million years. Because these lizards are similar in their ecology and the populations came back together around the same time, we can compare across the cases to see what is similar and what is different in how genes travel. In this work, we looked at (on average) 6,000 sites in the genome to see if they are being exchanged between the populations and how. We had two major findings: (1) the longer populations have been apart, the shorter distance their genes are exchanged, and (2) how a gene evolved, in terms of the selection history on that gene, has little influence in how far it travels. We are continuing to analyze these data to see if certain types of genes (i.e., those involved in physiology or reproduction) are more likely to travel further than others. In addition to our findings, this work has been shared in national and international conferences, has been used in outreach activities with school children and adults, and is currently in preparation for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Further, we developed new genomic resources through this work that have been published (10.1111/1755-0998.12077) and new bioinformatic tools that are in active use by multiple research groups (https://github.com/singhal?tab=repositories).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/24/2013<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sonal&nbsp;Singhal</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
