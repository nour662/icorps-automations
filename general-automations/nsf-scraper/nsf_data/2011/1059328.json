 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:\r\nThe objective of Trust-Hub project is to lead a community-wide movement toward stronger assurances in\r\nthe digital hardware industry. The Trust-Hub is a means for information sharing between researchers and\r\npractitioners to accelerate the development of defenses against hardware-level attacks. This project\r\nproposes the development of Trust-Hub, a central web-based repository for technical papers, benchmarks,\r\nhardware platforms, source codes, tools, and other information that accelerates hardware security research\r\nand developments.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits:\r\nThis project plans to develop benchmark circuits infected with hardware Trojans (called trust\r\nbenchmarks), create hardware platforms to validate trust benchmarks, and develop a web portal to\r\naccelerate research and development in hardware security and trust. The project includes (i) creation of a\r\nlarge set of static trust benchmarks, (ii) benchmark complexity analysis, (iii) procedures to dynamically\r\ngenerate trust benchmarks with hard-to-detect Trojan instances, (iv) platforms for hardware emulation and\r\nvalidation of Trojan detection methods, (vii) a web-based repository called Trust-Hub, and (viii)\r\ncomprehensive validation test suites.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe results of this project would be of interest to fab-less semiconductor companies, US government\r\nagencies and university researchers worldwide. Benefits to the society include trustworthy electronics for\r\nhealthcare, defense, weather forecasting, finance, transportation, and automotive applications. By\r\nintegrating the results of this project into existing courses and by offering new courses in the\r\nundergraduate and graduate curriculum, the PIs will impart cutting-edge engineering knowledge to\r\nstudents and improve their hardware design, security verification and test skills.",
