 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for the conference \"Ramification in\r\nAlgebra and Geometry\" to be held at Emory University, 16-20 May 2011.\r\nThis conference is primarily focused on the interaction between\r\nalgebra, geometry, and number theory within the following thematic\r\nareas: the arithmetic of linear algebraic groups and homogeneous\r\nspaces, cohomological invariants, essential dimension, division\r\nalgebras and the Brauer group, Chow groups and motivic decomposition,\r\ngeneric Galois extensions, and Brauer-Manin obstructions.\r\n\r\nThis conference brings together international experts and junior\r\nresearchers working in these areas.  The unifying theme is\r\nramification.  The geometric notion of ramification is familiar to\r\nanyone who has seen a screw (helicoid): looking along the length of a\r\nscrew, the central axis--where all the threads meet--is where the\r\nscrew is \"ramified.\"  Off the central axis, the screw is not ramified:\r\na laser beam passing through the threads parallel to the central axis\r\npierces only distinct sheets of metal.  Here, the ramification\r\ndistinguishes a screw (helicoid) from a spring (helix).  Abstractions\r\nof this concept have proved fundamental in many areas of mathematics;\r\nthis conference will focus on some of the recent applications in\r\nalgebra and geometry.",
