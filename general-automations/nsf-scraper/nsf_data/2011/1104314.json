In addition, the project prepares residents of Imperial Valley with the necessary technical education needed to enter the alternative energy job market. The entry level technicians acquire knowledge about various alternative energy operations that are used by local firms. In order to properly train alternative energy technicians, the project works directly with the local and regional energy providers to ensure that the curriculum provides students with skill sets that meets local occupational standards. Particular focus is placed on continuous improvement to ensure that the alternative energy technician program maintains a practical technological environment and meets best practices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nImperial Valley College (IVC) is the primary post-secondary accredited institution to deliver lower division college courses leading to degrees, vocational/career technical training and certificate programs within the County of Imperial, located in rural southeastern California.  This is primarily an agricultural county with rich irrigated farmland, surrounded by vast areas of desert managed either by the U.S. Navy or the Department of Interior.  The county is comprised predominately of a  Hispanic population (86%) with some of the highest unemployment rates in the nation (25.2% in May 2015 per EDD) and is the unfortunate leader of many social indicators with high levels of poverty concomitant with low levels of educational attainment.\n\nImperial County experiences nearly 350 days of sunshine per year, with an annual rainfall of less than three inches.  With imported water from the Colorado River, Imperial County is one of the few areas in the world that produces agricultural products year round.  Geographically, Imperial County is a bowl, surrounded by low mountains on all four sides, with a large lake, the Salton Sea situated in the middle nearly 140 feet below sea level.  \n\nThe meteorology and geography of Imperial County is very important to the insurgence of renewable energy industries within the county.  Imperial Irrigation District (IID), one of IVC's advisory committee members has harnessed hydro electric power along the All American Canal.  Over 11, 000 acres of photovoltaic solar fields have been installed throughout Imperial Valley due to the 350+ days of sunlight we experience each and every year.  Another 11,000 acres of solar fields are currently being planned and reviewed.  Geothermal production throughout the county provides about 600MW of power.  Within the boundaries of the Salton Sea lies untapped geothermal fields, possibly adding another 10,000MW of geothermal energy to this expanding sustainable industry.  Being a valley surrounded by low coastal mountains, generates not only heat, but thermals and wind.  In return, Pattern Energy, another advisory committee member, has constructed a 126 unit wind mill farm on the western edge of Imperial County generating +300MW of power.  Other budding industries include alga firms, mining firms that extract metals from geothermal waste, bio fuels that use agricultural waste or even contracted crops such as sugar cane or sorgham, gradient saline solar ponds and energy storage facilities.   \n\nTherefore, the award for this Advanced Technological Education (ATE) small grant for new institutions project was considered to be seed money that would assist the college (IVC) by facilitating its concerted effort to create, develop and implement core curriculum required for an alternative energy technician program, eventually leading to a recognized degree with transferable credits.  In return, this would prepare local residents with the necessary knowledge of alternative energy enhanced by basic technical skills for anticipated entry level positions.\n\nFrom the onset of the grant, we collaborated with industry decision makers on every aspect of curriculum development, curriculum approval, implementation, job standards, industry recognized certifications, safety issues,  legal compliance and identified skills that were lacking within the applicant pool.  This Renewable Energy Advisory Committee (REAC) consisted of employers from Cal Energy (geothermal), Imperial Irrigation District (public Utility), Ormat (geothermal), Pattern Energy (wind) Energy Source (geothermal), SunPeak Solar (solar), along with educational partners such as the Imperial Valley Regional Occupational Program, San Diego State University-Imperial Valley, and the Workforce Investment Board of Imperial County.\n\nInitially the primary objective of this grant was to establish a marketable certificate program entitled Alternative Energy Technician.  With direction from the REAC we redesigned the original program and im..."
