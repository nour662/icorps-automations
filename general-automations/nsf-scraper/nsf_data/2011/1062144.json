 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ohio State University's Departments of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry will host an REU program for 12 students during the summers of 2011-2015. The objective of the 9-week internship is to provide an intense research experience in molecular life sciences that allows students to discover first-hand the excitement of being an independent scientist.  As a complement to the research component, students will gain experience in scientific communication, attend an undergraduate research conference, visit core facilities, explore the responsibilities that come with being a scientist, and equip themselves with information vital for entering graduate programs and careers in the life sciences. Faculty from the Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, with proven track records in supporting undergraduate research, will serve as mentors. The program offers a rich array of different research opportunities with a common thematic basis that promotes interaction at all levels. After an initial short laboratory workshop, which will provide students with a set of basic technical skills, the students will spend their remaining time working in a laboratory chosen based on their own research interest.  During this period, they will receive training and be encouraged to develop independence in formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, analyzing data and troubleshooting.  At the end of the summer, students will present a poster to summarize their results at an undergraduate conference and at a poster session for scientists in both departments. The impact of the program will be assessed by using a common survey adopted by all REU sites. The program is primarily designed for students currently at undergraduate institutions where there are limited chances to do research. A strong academic background is desired but signs of promise, other than GPA, will also be taken into serious consideration.  These will be primarily personal recommendations by faculty members.  Students from groups underrepresented in science are strongly encouraged to apply. All applications will be processed through the program website (http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/%7Emgmajors/REU/). Additional information can be found at the website as well us by contacting the program administrator Debbie Dotter (dotter.4@osu.edu) or the PI, Dr Amanda Simcox (simcox.1@osu.edu).",
