  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes\n\n(as of April 2015)\n\n \n\nThe Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) is a numerical weather prediction system run in support of the U.S. Antarctic Program and its forecasters.  The goals of the AMPS project have been: to maintain and enhance the system while providing numerical forecasts tailored for the needs of the USAP forecasters; to improve WRF in its high-latitude applications; and to foster collaboration among Antarctic forecasters, researchers, and students.  These goals continue to be met. \n\n \n\nThe core outcome of the project has been the successful support of the USAP and of NSF science and activities across Antarctica.  The project has provided reliable and tailored model forecast guidance to the USAP and SPAWAR.  It has contributed to cost savings through reductions in flight aborts and lost or delayed missions.  It has supported USAP resource deployment and scientific fieldwork across the high southern latitudes. \n\n \n\nAMPS continued to run WRF on nested forecast domains with spacings of 30 km, 10 km, 3.3 km, and 1.1 km.  In addition, a single, expanded, 3.3-km grid was added to cover the entire South Pole&ndash;Ross Sea sector, and it replaced two smaller domains.  Furthermore, two additional 27-km/9-km forecast grids have been added to support the operations out of New Zealand and around Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula. \n\n \n\nNCAR began running a WRF ensemble in AMPS, primarily based off of differing initial and boundary conditions.  The outcomes have been (i) an expanded range of model guidance to the forecasters, and (ii) an ability to run a hybrid data assimilation approach in AMPS.  \n\n \n\nThe AMPS web page (http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/rt/amps) was updated with new capabilities and products.  A recent example of a valuable new product is the 4-panel display.  The overall outcome is tailored forecaster support.  The backup AMPS web page (http://amps-backup.ucar.edu) was also maintained, providing robustness and redundancy in the forecast delivery system.\n\n \n\nThe project served scientific field campaigns.  In the 2014&ndash;2015 season, AMPS supported for SG-WEX, the South Georgia Wave Experiment, with a special WRF forecast grid.  This study focused on the nature and variability of gravity waves generated over South Georgia Is.  AMPS also provided preliminary test products for the future planned AVOCET experiment (Antarctic Vortex Chemistry, Energetics, and Dynamical Transport).  The AMPS project also regularly supported the cruises of the NSF research vessels Nathaniel B. Palmer and Laurence M. Gould.  The outcomes have been directly-provided guidance to NSF for its science and operations.\n\n \n\nAMPS has assisted forecasting in emergency operations in Antarctica.  The more recent episodes have been medevacs from McMurdo in April 2013 and May 2013.  In addition, in January 2013 AMPS supported the search attempts for a Twin Otter aircraft that crashed in the Transantarctic Mtns.  Through its provision of model output, AMPS also assisted international scientific efforts in Antarctica, including those of Italy, UK, Australia, Germany, Chile, South Africa, Argentina, China, and New Zealand.\n\n \n\nThe AMPS project has involved significant collaboration with the Antarctic meteorological community and has been central in the organization of the annual Antarctic Meteorological Observation, Modeling, and Forecasting (AMOMF) Workshop.  Over the past year, NCAR and OSU contributed to the planning and proceedings of the 9th AMOMF Workshop (June 2014).  The effort has produced papers describing the effort\u00c6s support of the USAP and polar WRF development and results.\n\n \n\nThe project served the research community through its AMPS archive, the storehouse of model forecast output.  The AMPS archive has been published on the Earth System Grid (ESG) web portal (http://www.earthsystemgrid.org/project/amps.html), greatly improving accessibility for users to the data.  In addition, OSU produced a separate, onlin..."
