 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates molecular mechanisms that allow fish to tolerate changes in water salinity. Salinity changes are pertinent in coastal fish habitats and desert lakes. Because water salinization represents a main environmental problem caused by climate change understanding how fish cope with salinity stress is critical. Some fish species, called euryhaline, such as tilapia have evolved extreme capacity for coping with salinity stress. This project utilizes molecular and biochemical approaches to investigate salinity stress response mechanisms in tilapia. It will reveal mechanisms underlying salinity tolerance and molecular cross-talk of stress and immune responses in fish. The focus is on gill tissue. Knowledge generated in this project allows targeting specific stress response mechanisms during fish management. A prerequisite for management of commercially important fish is knowledge of molecular pathways and physiological responses that should be targeted to alleviate environmental stress. Because many molecular responses to different types of stress are highly conserved the project has broad implications for understanding general stress response mechanisms in vertebrates (including humans). Moreover, the human kidney contains a region (the inner medulla) that experiences salinity fluctuations just like euryhaline fish. Understanding molecular coping mechanisms during salinity stress could benefit diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases associated with failure of the renal urinary concentrating mechanism. Training and education in fish and general vertebrate stress biology and molecular and biochemical approaches is provided to graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students. Outreach partnerships include the EnvironMentors and John Muir Institute of the Environment programs, aquaculture producers, state agencies, and the general public. Emphasis is placed on participation of underrepresented groups. The results of this project will be disseminated broadly via publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals, seminars, at scientific conferences and K-12 schools, web-based dissemination, posters, and during targeted hands-on outreach activities.",
