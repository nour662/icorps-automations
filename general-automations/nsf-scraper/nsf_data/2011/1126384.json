 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Xue-Long Sun from Cleveland State University and colleagues John Masnovi, Nolan Holland and Bin Su will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) development of chemically selective and biocompatible compounds for biomolecule, biomaterial and living cell modification and synthesis and evaluation of cell surface mimetic molecules for biological and biomedical research and applications, (b) synthesis and characterization of functional molecular building blocks for responsive materials, (c) design, synthesis and evaluation of aromatase inhibitors for hormone-dependent breast cancer, (d) polymerization initiators for synthetic biological materials and electrical conductors, (e) synthesis and evaluation of hydroximinosteroid derivatives as cytotoxic agents, (f) modulation of DNA base excision repair pathways through synthesis of methoxyamine-like compounds for materials and organic blocking of DNA apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, (g) studies of PNAs for nucleic-acid detection, (h) calculation of NMR protection factors using molecular mechanics, and (i) study of polycyclic biochemical mechanisms for metal accumulation in plants.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
