The goal of the site in the Physics Department at Oakland University (OU) is to expose young students from universities and community colleges, as well as senior high-school students, to the excitement of rigorous scientific research.  Projects are available in physics, materials, medical physics, and biochemistry.   For ten weeks, students will participate in an intensive research program composed of one-on-one mentoring, dedicated seminars, tutorials, field trips, and social activities, culminating in a conference-style final presentation.   The multidisciplinary team assembled will provide a variety of research-centered activities (tutorials, an ethics course, research intensive field trips) in a relaxed atmosphere provided by a small University campus.   This award is funded by the Division of Physics with co-funding support from the Division of Materials Research.",
