 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin of multicellular life is a central scientific question. Prior research has identified multiple benefits that maintain multicellular life, including larger body size and different cell types, but, how single celled life gave rise to complex multicellular organisms remains an open question. The proposed research focuses on observing and experimentally studying the origin of multicellularity as it occurs, using a newly developed research model of baker's yeast. The research has three objectives. First, the environmental conditions promoting the origin of multicellular life will be investigated. Second, the effects of increased mutation rate on the transition to multicellularity will be determined, because mutations can generate conflicts, such as cancer, in multicellular individuals. Third, the evolutionary consequences of multicellularity will be investigated, as multicellularity provides new avenues for adaptation.\r\n\r\nThe research focuses on a topic of special interest to the general public: the origin of biological complexity. While review of any biological system provides an appreciation of its complexity, the evolution of this complexity frequently remains opaque, even after intensive investigation. A major obstacle has been an inability to examine the origin of complexity as it arises, a limitation which has been overcome with this new system. This model yeast system lends itself to the application of experimental evolution to previously intractable problems in evolutionary biology, with the potential for widespread dissemination of these research techniques. The PIs will release educational materials through links to science education societies, specialist publications such as American Biology Teacher, and extensive outreach activities.",
