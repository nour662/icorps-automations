 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate parameterizations of the air-sea fluxes of CO2 into the Southern Ocean, in particular at high wind velocity, are needed to better assess how projections of global climate warming in a windier world could affect the ocean carbon uptake, and alter the ocean heat budget at high latitudes.  \r\n\r\nAir-sea fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat (water vapor) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are to be measured continuously underway on cruises using micrometeorological eddy covariance techniques adapted to ship-board use. The measured gas transfer velocity (K) is then to be related to other parameters known to affect air-sea-fluxes.\r\n \r\nA stated goal of this work is the collection of a set of direct air-sea flux measurements at high wind speeds, conditions where parameterization of the relationship of gas exchange to wind-speed remains contentious. The studies will be carried out at sites in the Southern Ocean using the USAP RV Nathaniel B Palmer as measurment platform.  Co-located pCO2 data, to be used in the overall analysis and enabling internal consistency checks, are being collected from existing underway systems aboard the USAP research vessel under other NSF awards.",

To achieve this goal, we made direct measurements of air-sea fluxes (momentum, heat, moisture, CO<sub>2</sub>) from the U.S. polar ship RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer (NBP) during 9 cruises over 18 months in 2013-2014.

In the sea ice zone, we found the gas transfer velocity to decrease in proportion with the fraction of sea ice cover.
