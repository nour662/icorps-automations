 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit. Severe technical challenges associated with the extremes of hydrostatic pressure have prevented major advances in hadal ecological studies, and relegated hadal systems to among the most poorly investigated habitats on Earth. The recent development of the fully functional Hybrid Remotely-Operated Vehicle Nereus has now prompted scientists from around the world to join together to identify the foremost standing questions in hadal science. Through this project,  Hadal Ecosystems Studies (HADES) program, PIs from 7 Institutions from around the world will determine the composition and distribution of hadal species, the role of hadal pressures (piezolyte concentrations, enzyme function under pressure), food supply (distribution of POC with the abundance and biomass of trench organisms, and metabolic rates/energetic demand), and depth/topography (genetic divergence and spatial connectivity of populations) have on impacting deep-ocean community structure. This project will examine these factors using the world's first full-ocean depth hybrid remotely operated vehicle (HROV) in conjunction with the only full-ocean depth imaging lander (Hadal-Lander). This will pose a comparative framework for investigating hadal and abyssal community structure as driven by pressure (and associated factors), food supply, physiological adaptations, and topographic relationships. The investigators' first order hypotheses to explain how faunal diversity and communities are structured in trenches completely lack the data necessary to test them. Thus this project will provide the first seafloor data and samples in one of the world's best, yet little known trenches- the Kermadec Trench (SW Pacific Ocean). The first international Trench Connection Symposium in 2010 concluded the need to identify patterns of trench faunal composition and understand the first order factors that play a role in structuring these ecosystems. Megafaunal community structure and the relationship between POC and benthic bacterial biomass will be examined as a function of depth and location by systematic high-definition imaging and sediment/faunal sampling transects from abyssal to full trench depths both along and perpendicular to the trench axis. Population genetic approaches will provide levels of genetic divergence and evolutionarily independent lineages to assess the role of depth and topography in trenches and their adjacent abyssal plain in promoting the formation of species. Physiological constraints will be investigated by examining in-situ respiration of selected fauna and tissue concentrations of such protein stabilizers as trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), and the structural adaptations of macromolecules. These objectives represent an achievable and powerful combination of current technological capability, scientific understanding and theory, and the expertise of an international consortium of scientists.\r\nBroader impacts. The project will direct new avenues of research in the deep ocean. The expedition and results will be disseminated broadly to the scientific community and the public through both active metadata and data sharing mechanisms, award winning sea-going web-based education curricula and data-posting web portals, museum exhibits, and a major National Geographic television event featuring trench and deep-sea science, including life forms at the deepest depths on earth will engage the imagination of scientists and public alike. Outreach with respect to global scientific literacy will focus on the fundamental planetary processes associated with hadal faunal ecology and evolution at the world's deepest trenches. A daily-updated web site from sea will provide real-time public, museum, and aquaria access to the ongoing cruise activities and discoveries. The integral involvement of postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students will foster professional and educational advancement opportunities for underrepresented groups. In addition, we will stimulate a broader collective of interested biologists, chemists, geologists, and others to advance the application of ecological and evolutionary theory to better understand the biodiversity that inhabits hadal ecosystems. To this end, the investigators will develop an international consortium for hadal science dedicated to training the next generation of marine scientists and in conjunction with INDEEP, international collaboration for deep-sea research. The  use of the HROV Nereus will advance this vehicle's capabilities for a broad range of disciplinary use, drive advances in applying technologies for conducting rigorous hadal and abyssal science, and further off-shoot technologies for use by the broader scientific community. The results of this project will be the first of its kind regarding the environmental variables that structure trench communities and lay the essential foundation for future work on the dynamic processes that create and maintain biodiversity in the deep ocean.",

Much of hadal knowledge comes from 1950s trawling expeditions, yielding an initial catalogue of species. Importantly, these and later explorations found invertebrates (e.g., amphipods, holothurians) to 11,000m, but never found fish below 8,340m. However, sampling was limited and nets did not yield ecological information (densities, distributions, behaviors, food chains, species uncaught). Few studies examined adaptations to crucial factors such as hydrostatic pressure. The development of <em>Nereus</em> and free-falling landers (Fig. 1A,B,C) prompted our international team (USA, UK, New Zealand; Japan) to form HADES (Hadal Ecosystem Studies). Our goals: explore types and distributions of hadal organisms; behaviors; and effects of pressure, food supply, metabolism, and topography.</p>\n<p>This report covers Whitman College research by me and undergraduates on pressure adaptations and whether those confer limits to some species. Pressure reaches 1101 atm in Mariana Trench's Challenger Deep (~11,000m). Pressure, while not imploding organisms lacking air chambers, forces water molecules into proteins (e.g., enzymes), and induces non-functional protein aggregates, impairing cellular functions. Work began with fish (Kermadec Trench snailfish, 7000m, last caught 1952) collected from NIWA's <em>Kaharoa</em> [2011; NIWA, Aberdeen, JAMSTEC, Whitman (undergraduate Mackenzie Gerringer) researchers]. Doug Bartlett (Scripps) collected amphipods from the Challenger Deep for us on James Cameron's DEEPSEA CHALLENGE project (2012). Full-team NSF-HADES exploration occurred on R/V <em>Thompson</em> (landers and <em>Nereus</em>), Kermadec Trench between 4000m and 10,000m (spring 2014). We also leveraged NSF funding for a Schmidt Ocean Institute lander expedition to Mariana Trench (late 2014). See Fig. 2 for some species caught for analysis.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit</p>\n<p>How proteins work under high pressure, and whether pressure limits some organisms, remain major deep-sea questions. Many proteins have evolved pressure resistance. However mechanisms are poorly understood and often incomplete, with some proteins from deep species exhibiting inhibition in pressure chambers. Prior to HADES, we discovered (1996-2007) that trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) increases linearly with depth (as pressure does) in bony fish, at least to 5,000m. TMAO, long known as an osmolyte (solute that reduces cellular water loss due to ocean salt), is the source of marine fishy odor. I found (1970s) that TMAO stabilizes shark proteins against the waste product urea, yielding biotechnology and medical applications. Later (1996-2004) we found TMAO is a \"piezolyte\" (pressure solute), protecting proteins by preventing pressure-forcing of water molecules into them. Extrapolating TMAO levels, I noted fish osmolalities (solute concentrations) could exceed seawater at ~8400m, drawing excess water inwards. This suggested that fish could not go deeper: bony fishes lose water due to lower osmolalities than seawater, with gills and kidneys adapted to retain water; no fully marine fish can cope with overhydration. Invertebrates, though, are isosmotic with seawater using osmolytes like taurine.</p>\n<p>Findings:</p>\n<p>A. The first evidence that pressure may be an ecological limit:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1) No fish were seen or trapped by <em>Nereus</em> or landers below 8145m (one fish there; soaring amphipod densities below ~8000m without fish predation);</p>\n<p>2) Fish TMAO (Fig. 3A) and consequently osmolalities (Fig. 3B) increase linearly to ~8,000m, strongly supporting piezolyte and 8400m-limit hypotheses.</p>\n<p>B. Novel pressure adaptations; the deepest animal enzymes yet tested:</p>\n<p>1) Amphipods too show depth increases in TMAO, but unlike fish, replace taurine with glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and other osmolytes (Figs. 4A,B,C). GPC protects mammalian kidneys from urea, so may help with pressure;</p>\n<p>2) Both taxa show depth increases in scyllo-inositol (Figs. 5A,B), a polyol that breaks up maladaptive protein aggregates better than TMAO.</p>\n<p>3) One hadal fish enzyme is activated by pressure, a novel discovery (Fig. 6A); but another requires TMAO to function (Fig. 6B).</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts</p>\n<p>Pressure is used to sterilize food, but some bacteria survive by accumulating piezolytes. Scyllo-inositol is being tested to treat Alzheimer's Disease, as it breaks up protein aggregates correlated with that disease. Pressure and piezolytes are used by biophysicists as tools to probe water's roles in protein folding and function. Understanding how nature uses piezolytes has impacted these applications.</p>\n<p>Undergraduates engaged had their career prospects enhanced by emersion in cutting-edge marine research: Mackenzie Gerringer (2011-12), now Ph.D. candidate in HADES, University of Hawai'i; Gemma Wallace (2013-14), now applying to graduate programs; Anna Downing (2015-16) and Chloe Weinstock (2016-17), both planning on marine graduate work.</p>\n<p>Results were broadly distributed to the scientific community through HADES (www.whoi.edu/hades) and NOAA Ocean Explorer websites, numerous scientific presentations including a hadal session at the 2015 Deep-Sea Biology Symposium, and our metadata BCO-DMO repository (http://www.bcodmo.org/project/536452).</p>\n<p>Outreach impacted wider society. Press releases garnered widespread media attention (millions of webpage hits, ~200 published articles in ~23 countries, numerous radio interviews, shipboard blogs) that substantially advanced the public&rsquo;s awareness of hadal habitats, the challenges of studying them, and instilled wonder at the marvelous inhabitants of this realm.

GPC protects mammalian kidneys from urea, so may help with pressure;\n\n2) Both taxa show depth increases in scyllo-inositol (Figs. 5A,B), a polyol that breaks up maladaptive protein aggregates better than TMAO.\n\n3) One hadal fish enzyme is activated by pressure, a novel discovery (Fig. 6A); but another requires TMAO to function (Fig. 6B).\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nPressure is used to sterilize food, but some bacteria survive by accumulating piezolytes. Scyllo-inositol is being tested to treat Alzheimer's Disease, as it breaks up protein aggregates correlated with that disease. Pressure and piezolytes are used by biophysicists as tools to probe water's roles in protein folding and function. Understanding how nature uses piezolytes has impacted these applications.\n\nUndergraduates engaged had their career prospects enhanced by emersion in cutting-edge marine research: Mackenzie Gerringer (2011-12), now Ph.D. candidate in HADES, University of Hawai'i; Gemma Wallace (2013-14), now applying to graduate programs; Anna Downing (2015-16) and Chloe Weinstock (2016-17), both planning on marine graduate work.\n\nResults were broadly distributed to the scientific community through HADES (www.whoi.edu/hades) and NOAA Ocean Explorer websites, numerous scientific presentations including a hadal session at the 2015 Deep-Sea Biology Symposium, and our metadata BCO-DMO repository (http://www.bcodmo.org/project/536452).\n\nOutreach impacted wider society. Press releases garnered widespread media attention (millions of webpage hits, ~200 published articles in ~23 countries, numerous radio interviews, shipboard blogs) that substantially advanced the public?s awareness of hadal habitats, the challenges of studying them, and instilled wonder at the marvelous inhabitants of this realm. BBC is perusing HADES videos for their Oceans miniseries.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/10/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul H Yancey"
