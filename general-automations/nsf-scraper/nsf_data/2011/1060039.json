The project builds on the rich scholarship infrastructure that has been created at the University of Houston-Clear Lake. This infrastructure includes faculty mentoring, peer mentoring, partnerships with the surrounding community colleges, career enrichment activities, and a strong placement program. Through the current project, this infrastructure is enhanced by an incentive-based system to encourage increased participation of faculty mentors, S-STEM scholars, community college instructors and industrial partners. The project plans to award 18 scholarships with an average of $7,300 annually for four years.",
