 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the climate forcing of the unabated growth of the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the global atmospheric circulation and hydrological cycle are bound to change. Despite the pivotal role of the atmospheric circulation in climate change and climate feedback, our understanding in its natural variability, its response to global warming forcing, and the associated impacts on the temporal and spatial distributions of the precipitation remains limited, due in part to the diversity of the background wind configurations throughout the annual cycle.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the sensitivities and mechanisms of the atmospheric circulation response to GHG warming forcing throughout the annual cycle, and to link the circulation changes to the changes in the mean and extremes of precipitation. The investigators will combine purposefully designed sensitivity experiments using a hierarchy of atmospheric models with analyzing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model simulations, a new set of ultra-high resolution climate simulations and the existent observations and reanalysis. They will revolve around three inter-related scientific themes: (1) sensitivities and mechanisms of the mean circulation responses to global warming forcing under different circulation regimes (corresponding to different seasons and different sectors of the globe); (2) the leading mode of variability under different circulation regimes and the linkage between the unforced intrinsic mode of variability to the mean response to global warming forcing; (3) connection between the leading mode of variability, as occurs naturally or as a result of climate change forcing, and precipitation extreme fingerprint. \r\n \r\nThis work will improve our understanding of (1) characteristics of atmospheric circulation and the relationship between the mean and the leading mode of variability; (2) the seasonal dependence in the response of the circulation over different sectors of the globe; (3) mechanism-based interpretation of the response of hydrological cycle and its extremes to GHG warming.\r\n \r\nBroader impacts encompass the following aspects: (1) The confidence gained in regional hydrological projection is valuable to water resource management and water policy making; (2) Several graduate and undergraduate students from two institutions will be trained and extensively involved; (3) Modeling outputs from this project will be archived in the \"community-oriented\" High Performance Storage System (HPSS) archive service system at National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to facilitate the sharing of the data to broader scientific communities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHuman activities are releasing carbon into the atmosphere at least one hundred times faster than the Earth\u00c6s natural rate.  If the current rate of fossil fuel consumption continues to grow unabated, the CO2 concentration will reach twice as much as its pre-industrial level (280 part per million) by the middle of the century.  This makes the scenario of doubling CO2 not only a topic of theoretical interest, but also a serious subject for assessing the impending climate change as the 21st century progresses.\n\n \n\nAmong the most significant projections for the global warming-induced climate change are the changes concerning the global hydrological cycle.  While the hydrologic cycle as a whole is expected to intensified, it is predicted that the amount of precipitation over subtropical areas, including the southern Australia, Southern Chile and Southern Argentina, Southern Europe and the southwestern United States, will be substantially reduced.  The acute drying at the poleward fringe of the subtropical dry zone indicates a global-scale expansion of the Hadley cell.  The expansion of the Hadley cell is also inextricably linked to the poleward movement of the westerly jet in the extratropics.  As a result, precipitation associated with the midlatitude storm tracks is projected to shift poleward.  Our confidence in many features of the hydrological response in a warming climate can be grounded in the robust change of atmospheric circulation.\n\n \n\nThis three-year NSF-funded project has been focused on a comprehensive understanding of the sensitivities and mechanisms of the atmospheric circulation response to greenhouse gas warming throughout the annual cycle and the linkage to the changes in the mean precipitation and extremes.  The main methodology is the combination of the idealized Atmospheric Global Circulation Model (AGCM) simulations with the analysis of the data output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) model simulations.\n\n \n\nThe first theme of research is on the mechanisms for the Hadley cell and extratropical response to global warming-like thermal forcing in a hierarchy of atmospheric global circulation models (AGCMs).  This model hierarchy with decreasing complexity consists of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) AM2.1 and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) CAM3 simulations with prescribed SST changes, the GFDL aquaplanet model with uniform SST warming, the GFDL atmospheric dry dynamical core with idealized tropical warmings, and a quasi-geostrophic (QG) model with altered thermal forcing.  In these studies a new diagnostic has been developed to delineate the nonlinear effect of the eddy adjustment to realistic or idealized climate change forcings.\n\n \n\nCollectively, these results highlight the importance of the irreversible mixing of potential vorticity (PV) in the poleward shift of the eddy-driven jet under global warming.  Particularly, this involves a decrease of effective diffusivity in midlatitudes and an associated reduction in the dissipation of wave activity there, which allows more wave activity to survive the midlatitude dissipation, and an increase of effective diffusivity in the upper-tropospheric subtropics, which acts to homogenize the upper tropospheric PV there,  both constructively pushing the maximum PV gradient poleward.  The structure in the change of effective diffusivity appears to dominate the structure in the change of the eddy PV flux, and hence that of the eddy momentum flux convergence.  The mechanism outlined above seems to be independent of the atmospheric model, model configurations, and to some extent, even the details of the SST forcings.\n\n \n\nThe second thrust of research is on the dynamical effect of circulation shift on precipitation extremes.  It is found that the dynamical shift in circulation contributes substantially to the response of precipitation extremes under idealized climate warming forcing, whereas the thermodynamic contribution is b..."
