However, while powerful tools to control neuronal firing\r\nusing genetically encoded light-activated channels have recently been developed, limitations of current\r\ngenetically encoded sensors of neuronal activity severely restrict their use for monitoring brain function.\r\nIn particular, calcium sensors are slow and cannot report on subthreshold depolarizations. While voltage\r\nsensors could in principle be used to follow fast trains of action potentials and monitor subthreshold\r\ndepolarizations, the low dynamic range of existing sensors makes them unsuitable for most experiments\r\nin vivo. Moreover, there are presently no calcium or voltage sensors that are efficiently excited by red\r\n(>550nm) wavelengths, a region of the spectrum that would enable their concurrent use with blue/greenabsorbing\r\nlight-activated channels.\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to address these needs by developing a new generation of genetically\r\nencoded voltage biosensors with significantly improved dynamic range and speed and the ability to be\r\nused concurrently with light-activated channels. This work will enable finer and more powerful functional\r\ndissection of the nervous system, while also establishing new protein engineering methods. The expertise\r\nof the lab in fluorescent proteins engineering will be leveraged to educate future scientists and engineers\r\nabout research in protein engineering, and to introduce educators to the utility of genetically encoded\r\nbiosensors for teaching scientific concepts in laboratory courses.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe engineering objective of this proposal is to apply knowledge of fluorescence spectroscopy\r\nand protein structure to quantitatively improve the performance of an existing class of voltage sensors\r\n(Aim 1) and to develop an entirely new class of voltage sensors (Aim 2). In the first aim, we will increase\r\ndynamic range via rational optimization of F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent\r\nproteins linked to a voltage sensing domain. In the second aim, we will use a conformationally sensitive\r\nred fluorescent protein to report on movements of a voltage sensing domain with rapid kinetics. For both\r\naims, we will employ rational design combined with comprehensive saturation mutagenesis and screening\r\nof important sites.\r\nThis project will be a pioneering study in molecular engineering in two ways. It will be the first to\r\nrationally apply predictions from modeling of F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer to identify the factors\r\nlimiting the fluorescence output response, and then to perform protein engineering to comprehensively\r\naddress those factors. Second, this project will be the first to combine comprehensive screening with\r\natomic-level structural knowledge of sensing domains and fluorescent proteins in order to create an\r\nentirely new class of allosteric voltage sensors; this research will thus give insight on the relative\r\nusefulness of prior knowledge and screening to the engineering of genetically encoded biosensors.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nVoltage sensors developed through this project will be promptly disseminated to the larger\r\nscientific community. These sensors will have a broad impact on the field of neuroscience by enabling\r\nrobust voltage sensing and concurrent control and readout of neuronal activity. Our work will also impact\r\nthe field of bioengineering by validating concepts and establishing strategies for how to optimize the\r\ndesign of fluorescent protein-based sensors using energy transfer or allostery.\r\nThe proposed project will provide an excellent opportunity to introduce undergraduates and high\r\nschool students, including students from disadvantaged backgrounds, to research in molecular\r\nbioengineering. It will also provide the opportunity to introduce educators to the use of genetically\r\nencoded biosensing to create exciting laboratory lessons that teach important basic concepts while\r\ndemonstrating the results of recent research in protein engineering.",
