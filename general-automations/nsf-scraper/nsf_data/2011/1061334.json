 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the application of parameter instability tests from theoretical statistics to the study of measurement invariance in psychometrics.  The tests, based on Gaussian processes, have the ability to identify subgroups of both individuals and model parameters that violate measurement invariance.  In contrast, existing tests of measurement invariance require the (potentially) violating subgroups and model parameters to be specified in advance.  The project includes theory development, study of test performance in psychometric applications, and R software development.  The work will yield a more comprehensive set of tools than currently is available for studying measurement invariance in a variety of psychometric models.\r\n\r\nInformally, measurement invariance involves the notion that a scale (or set of scales) measures everyone in the same manner.  That is, if two individuals have the same \"amount\" of an ability of interest, a scale should assign the same score to the two individuals (save for random error).  A scale violates measurement invariance if it systematically assigns different scores to the two individuals.  For example, this issue is exceptionally problematic when the scales come from a college entrance exam: individuals of equal ability may systematically receive different scores.  The project will apply novel statistical methods to the issue of measurement invariance, advancing theoretical knowledge and addressing standing problems on the topic.  Open source software and realistic applications of the methods also will be developed, ensuring that the methods are broadly disseminated and accessible to a wide range of researchers.  The project will lead to advances in applied knowledge on social science issues.  Because the issue of measurement invariance involves the study of group differences, the proposed research will help ensure that psychometric scales treat diverse groups of individuals equally.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to develop new statistical methods for assessing bias (\"lack of invariance\") in tests of ability, including standardized tests that are common in educational settings.  Because the nation relies so heavily on these types of tests, it is important to ensure that the tests are fair to the diverse groups of individuals taking the tests.  The methods developed here help us to study the tests' fairness, and the software resulting from the project helps researchers and test developers to apply the methods.\n\nIn the first part of the project, we applied statistical theory (involving stochastic processes) to develop new methodology that can be applied to the bias assessments described above.  The methodology is more flexible than traditional methodology, in that we can assess test bias when the groups are defined by unordered categories (i.e., ethnicity), ordered categories (i.e., levels of socioeconomic status), or continuous variables (i.e., annual income).  Traditional methodology focuses on the \"unordered category\" case.\n\nIn the second part of the project, we studied the new methodology's utility using both real data and simulation study.  In the simulations, we applied the methodology to artificial data that contained varying levels of bias.  We found that the methodology exhibited reasonable power to detect the biases that traditional methods could detect, and we also found that the methodology could detect biases that traditional methods could not detect.  We further applied the methodology to data from a Dutch intelligence test and to data from psychological scales purporting to measure youth gratitude.  These applications highlighted the novel results that we can obtain from the methods.  In particular, we were able to detect bias in the intelligence test with respect to grade point average (a continuous variable), and we were able to detect bias in the youth gratitude scales with respect to age group (a variable with ordered categories).\n\nFinally, in the third part of the project, we developed free software for carrying out the methodology and extended the methodology to solve related problems.  The software was designed to work seamlessly with existing R software packages, including lavaan and strucchange.  This allows users to employ familiar software, employing only one additional command to carry out the methodology developed here.  We developed tutorials and documentation in support of this software, and we also extended the software to address related problems.  Most notably, we implemented a formal statistical test to compare non-nested structural equation models, and we also implemented Bayesian methods to study test bias.\n\nFor all parts of the project, we maintained our computer code on a website so that other researchers could replicate or extend any results from our publications.  We anticipate that this will make our work accessible and extensible to future researchers and practitioners.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edgar Merkle"
