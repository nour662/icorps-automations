 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a major need in the glass\r\nmanufacturing industry by developing a wireless sensor for 3?]D imaging of glass furnace walls to identify\r\nrefractory erosion and molten glass leaks. The furnace walls are comprised of insulation and AZS\r\n(Alumina, Zirconium, Silica) refractories which are highly lossy and very dispersive at high temperatures.\r\nA conventional approach would inevitably be constrained by its system dynamic range, and thus the\r\nmost important molten glass?]AZS echo would be virtually invisible regardless of the sophistication of\r\ndigital processing on the measured results. This project takes a holistic approach from antenna design to\r\nimaging algorithm to sensor architecture in order to tackle very demanding requirements of the furnace\r\nwall. It aims to accomplish (1) accurate characterization of attenuation and dispersive properties of the\r\nfurnace walls (2) optimal antenna design to match with minimum inter?]coupling, (3) high resolution\r\nimaging algorithm that leverages prior knowledge of wall properties, and (4) hardware architecture with\r\nthe highest possible dynamic range in such a high temperature environment.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it offers a 3?]D sensor that will enable a\r\nmaintenance program based upon the real condition of the furnace to realize longer life span of high\r\ntemperature furnaces and make informed local maintenance without a major interruption in the\r\nproduction. This translates to significant financial savings for the glass manufacturing industry given the\r\nmulti?]million dollar initial capital investment is required to build a furnace, followed by a multi?]million\r\ndollar spending to maintain it. Further, several catastrophic accidents have occurred in the past due to\r\nmolten glass leaking from the furnaces. These catastrophic accidents resulted in death of several\r\nemployees, significant financial damage and severe production disruption. Therefore, this project will\r\nenable safer manufacturing environment for the glass manufacturing industry since potential areas for\r\nmolten glass leakages and structural health of furnace walls will be assessed with the 3?]D imaging\r\ntechnology being developed under this project. Lastly, this research will also lead to new design\r\nconcepts for sensing through dispersive and high loss media in extremely high temperature\r\nenvironment, thus introducing new approaches for wireless sensing technologies in harsh environments.",
