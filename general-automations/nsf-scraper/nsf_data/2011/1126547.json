 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide for the acquisition of an Applied Biosystems 3500xL 24-capillary DNA Analyzer to foster research and research training capabilities at the University of Houston-Clear Lake (UHCL). The ABI 3500xL DNA Analyzer is a fully automated capillary electrophoresis system with a capacity of sequencing up to 400,000 base pairs per day. The requested equipment will be used by at least eight faculty members in biology, biotechnology and environmental science for their research activities as well as for research training of undergraduate and graduate students. The DNA Analyzer will be utilized to detect pesticide resistance-associated gene mutations in Rhipicephalus microplus, to study essential amino acid biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula, to study molecular mechanisms of environmental stress in soft corals, to study molecular mechanisms involved in the maintenance of zinc homeostasis in plants, to study microbial populations in Galveston Bay, and to study regulation of human inducible nitric oxide synthase.  \r\n\r\nAcquisition of the high-throughput DNA Analyzer will enhance faculty research and advance student learning by enriching courses in genomics and through integration of hands-on exposure for independent research projects using modern instrumentation. Faculty and student researchers will use the equipment to address important problems in the areas of biology, biotechnology and environmental science. For example, the DNA Analyzer will be used to determine the genes responsible for pesticide resistance in the Texas cattle tick, which has led to major loss to the cattle industry. The Analyzer will be used to address problems related to human welfare, such as the role of nitric oxide in the human body, and how to improve the nutritional quality of plant foods, such as legumes, to address the worldwide problem of malnutrition from plant-based diets. The Analyzer will also be used to determine the effects of environmental stress on soft corals, to characterize the microbial community of Galveston Bay, and in other projects important to the environment. \r\n\r\nThis equipment will greatly enhance the generation of research publications and grant proposals from UHCL and enhance ongoing collaborations with regional and national organizations such as the USDA Children?s Nutrition Research Center, USDA-ARS-Livestock Insect Research Laboratory, Nalco Chemical company, and Baylor College of Medicine. Acquisition of this equipment will address both local and national needs for well-trained B.S. and M.S graduates with research skills in biology, biotechnology and environmental science.  At least 50 B.S. and M.S. students per year will use the instrument in independent studies and thesis research and another 30 students in formal training courses. A high percentage of these students will be from groups underrepresented in science. Local 7th to 12th grade science students will also be given opportunities to access data from this equipment to learn how to perform genetic and genomic analysis.",
