 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goal of the project is to provide chemistry and biochemistry students with the fundamental understanding and practical experience necessary to be successful in their future careers. One effective means for doing this is through introduction of modern chemical instrumentation early and throughout the chemistry and biochemistry curricula. \r\n\r\nThis project develops laboratory exercises of increasing sophistication that utilize four liquid chromatography systems with varying capabilities. Chromatography is an important enabling instrumental method that is used in various forms across the chemical and biochemical disciplines for a wide variety of applications, including pharmaceutical, food, environmental and biomedical analyses and studies. The exercises begin with illustrative bench top exercises and culminate with hands-on experience. Exercises of increasing sophistication are being implemented in laboratories at all levels of the curriculum, such that students who complete the curriculum have a strong working knowledge of this important technology. \r\n\r\nAn important aspect of this project is the implementation of liquid chromatography exercises in large-enrollment laboratory courses like those taught at most intermediate or large universities. This is accomplished through early instruction using illustrative bench top exercises and through application of multiple state-of-the-art yet affordable separations instruments that allow fast separations. The project is also introducing the technology to local high school science teachers through workshops. In addition, high school students that utilize the instrumentation are being supported to attend local and regional science fairs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has developed new and effective laboratory exercises to teach and train students in the theory and application of chromatography.  The project has taken advantage of recent developments in liquid chromatographic instrumentation and technology to make the technique accessible and applicable in introductory and large enrollment as well as advanced laboratory courses.  The educational experiences of more than 1000 students have been impacted to date.\n\nSince its introduction in 1903, chromatography has developed into an invaluable laboratory tool in chemistry and biology for the analysis, identification and quantitation of chemical compounds.  Chromatography is used for the separation of a chemical mixture into its individual components. This approach allows for both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The former is the identification of a substance and the latter is the determination of the amount of a substance.\n\nLiquid chromatography (LC), in which analyses are conducted in liquid solvents, is one of the main chromatographic approaches in use today. The importance of this is evident when one realizes that most substances can only be analyzed in solution, and that virtually every biological entity (animals, plants, and people) is water-based. Due to its broad and diverse applicability, this instrumental technique is used in virtually every corner of science including environmental science, forensics, food science, agriculture science, in industrial, government, and academic labs, and in virtually every sector of the biotechnology arena.  Educating science students in the theory and application of liquid chromatography is thus a necessity.\n\nAlthough LC is an essential tool in much of the chemical and biological sciences, it has not often been taught in introductory undergraduate laboratories or in undergraduate laboratories with large enrollments.  This is because the instruments are considered too expensive and insufficiently robust, and because LC separations are considered too slow for large enrollment laboratories.\n\nRecent developments in LC technology, however, make it possible to conduct relatively fast separations.  Additionally, the cost of LC instrumentation has come down in recent years, such that instruments are now affordable for many undergraduate institutions.\n\nThis project has utilized state-of-the art LC instrumentation and technology to introduce this important analytical method into instructional laboratories across the university-level chemistry curriculum.  The NSF-TUES grant allowed us to acquire four LC instruments and incorporate them into multiple laboratory courses at different educational levels.  We introduced LC into high-enrollment introductory labs wherein students synthesized aspirin and separated the product from the starting components.

Over 1,000 students to date have had hands on experience with these instruments, and many additional students will re..."
