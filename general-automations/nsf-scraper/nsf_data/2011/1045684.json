 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most earthquakes occur in the Earth's shallow crust, but some are located at greater depth.  These intermediate-depth earthquakes occur in the crust and upper mantle of tectonic plates that are subducting into the deep Earth at collisional plate boundaries.  Beyond this, we lack an understanding of why these earthquakes occur at some places (e.g., Colombia, Afghanistan, Romania, northern Cascadia), but not at other, seemingly similar, collisional plate boundaries.  We also lack a model that explains their recurrence, i.e., why they occur when they do.  While not as deadly as shallow earthquakes, intermediate-depth earthquakes can occasionally be devastating.  For example, the 1939 Chillan, Chile intermediate-depth earthquake killed ~28,000 people, and is by far the deadliest earthquake in that country's history.  Intermediate-depth earthquakes can also be quite damaging.  For example, the 2001 Nisqually, Washington earthquake caused over $2 billion in losses, despite being located on the southern fringe of metropolitan Seattle.  The focus of this study is the intense \"nest\" of intermediate-depth earthquakes under Bucaramanga, Colombia.  This area hosts the greatest concentration of intermediate-depth earthquakes in the world, and their frequent occurrence means that this presents the best opportunity in the world to study them.  By using data from the state-of-the-art Colombian National Seismic Network, we will gain a deeper understanding into how these earthquakes work.  Although he will be supported with funding from his own institution, this project will help build collaborations between Colombia and the US.  It will also help develop capacity for earthquake monitoring and evaluation in the developing world.  The understanding of intermediate-depth earthquakes that we develop should be broadly applicable to similar earthquakes worldwide, including the Pacific Northwest of the US.\r\n\r\nThis three-year project, to be carried out in collaboration with Professor German Prieto of the University of the Andes in Bogota, Colombia, will study the intense concentration of intermediate-depth earthquakes under Bucaramanga, Colombia using state-of-the-art analysis of waveform data from the Colombian National Seismic network.  We will use cross-correlation-based measurements to develop: precise earthquake locations, improved 3D velocity structure, and more accurate source parameter estimates of these events.  The result will be a better understanding of earthquakes in the Bucaramanga Nest in particular, and intermediate-depth earthquakes in general.  Among the questions we will address are: Do these earthquakes occur due to collision of the Caribbean and Nazca Plates at depth?  Do they occur on discernable fault planes or are they diffuse throughought the subducting slab?  Are there Vp/Vs anomalies that might indicate a role for pore fluids in their occurence?  How do the source properties of intermediate-depth earthquakes vary with earthquake size?  Can we identify repeating earthquakes, and if so, is their recurrence non-Poissonian (i.e., not random in time, but governed by a physically motivated process like elastic rebound)?  What controls the maximum size of intermediate-depth earthquakes under Bucaramanga?  How can the results of our study be used to place useful constraints on the size and recurrence of intermediate-depth earthquakes around the world that will be useful for hazard characterization?\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Geophysics Program and the Colombia Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis three-year project aimed to improve our understanding of earthquakes that occur at a depth of 70-300 km below the Earth's surface.  These are referred to as \"intermediate-depth\" earthquakes, and they are interesting because they occur at depths where laboratory experiments indicate that earthquakes should not occur.  They clearly do occur, however, and it's important to understand why and how that happens.  There are two competing ideas to explain their occurrence.  The first is that water released by dehydration reactions of minerals effectively lubricates faults and allows them to slip.  The second is that the heating that accompanies localized deformation causes weakening, which further localizes deformation as slip onto faults and creates more heat through friction.  This positive feedback is known as a thermal runaway.  Our results are consistent with the second of these ideas, the thermal runaway hypothesis.  Our findings fall into three categories: \n\n(1) We found that small, intermediate-depth earthquakes are very inefficient at generating seismic waves.  This observation is consisent with the thermal runaway hypothesis because it indicates that for small earthquakes, much of the energy is taken up near the fault, possibly through melting of rock.  For larger earthquakes, this would be a negligible effect.\n\n(2) We found a relative scarcity of small, intermediate-depth earthquakes.  We consider this to be consistent with the thermal runaway hypothesis because small earthquakes would have a bias to grow large (and not be small anymore) due to the thermal runaway process.  Although it sounds simple, documenting that small earthquakes are \"missing\" requires establishing sensitive measures to detect as many small earthquakes as possible, accurate magnitude measures for small earthquakes, and a quantitative assessment of the expected detection threshold such that the observations of a lack of small earthquakes aren't simply an artifact of an incomplete earthquake catalog.  After taking these steps, we confirmed the scarcity of small earthquakes in the Bucaramanga Nest.\n\n(3) We discovered two populations of earthquakes that occur in close proximity to one another, yet with an opposite sense of slip.  After relocating these earthquakes as accurately as possible, we were able to infer that they are consistent in their geometry with features that form in shallower rocks when they are squeezed and stretched ductilely - that is - without fracturing brittlely.  This suggests that the earthquakes we observe are occurring at very near the brittle-ductile transition, such that temperature perturbations would have a strong effect on their behavior.  This too supports the thermal runaway hypothesis, though not as directly as points (1) and (2).\n\nWhile our work under this project strongly suggests that thermal runaway plays a key role in intermediate-depth earthquakes, our findings strictly only apply to the Bucaramanga Nest under Colombia.  The next, obvious step will be to apply our techniques to intermediate-depth earthquakes around the world to see whether our conclusions generalize.  This will be key to establishing the broader scientific impacts.  Other, immediate broader impacts are that the empirical subspace detection method we developed to detect small earthquakes is now being used to detect small tectonic earthquakes in Europe and to detect injection-induced earthquakes in the central US.  Another broader impact is that this grant funded the PhD research of Sarah Barrett, a woman in a STEM field in which females remain under-represented.  Dr. Barrett is now working in the private sector for reinsurance company SwissRe in Armonk, New York, where she is using her background to help insurance companies redistribute their risk from natural hazards.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory Beroza"
