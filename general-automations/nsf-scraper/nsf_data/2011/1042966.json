 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of developing a laser-based rapid monitoring gauge for accurate non-contact downhole stress measurement in drilling operations of the geosciences and oil and gas industries.  Conventional downhole stress measurement, which commonly uses hydrofracturing, is complex, slow, inaccurate and detrimental to the environment.  The proposed innovation features fast non-contact laser interrogation, rugged portable configuration, and on-line data processing and presentation, which offers great convenience for field applications.  The proposed stress gauge is environment-friendly in operation as well. This Phase I effort will fabricate a laboratory assembly and demonstrate the research concept.  A feasibility demonstration will be conducted on the geologic materials.  Successful research and development will result in a non-contact, rapid measurement device for stress evaluation in downhole applications.  \r\n\tThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are in two aspects. First, the innovation will impact the 300 million dollar domestic annual market (0.5 ? 1% of the total operating cost) for down-hole stress measurement. The second aspect concerns social impact: conventional down-hole stress measurement is based on the hydrofracturing process, which has been challenged by environmental groups for its potential to contaminate underground water resources.  Forthcoming legislation will provide stricter EPA regulation of the use of hydrofracturing.  The proposed innovation, if successful, will provide an alternative method of downhole in-situ stress measurement that is not only simple, fast, and accurate, but also environment-friendly in order to ensure our environmental sustainability for generations to come.",

The demonstration was conducted on rock materials and conditions of direct interest to the field of geosciences.        The feasibility study involves five tasks: 1. specimen preparation, 2. laser ultrasonic instrumentation, 3. implementation of on-line data processing, 4. system demonstration, and 5. report and Phase II proposal, as described in the proposal.  The research work was completed with excellent results.\n\n      Feasibility Evaluation.  This SBIR Phase I project has been very successful in demonstrating the research concepts of \"A 3-D downhole laser stress gage for oil and gas industries.\"  The evaluation for the feasibility of a successful Phase II research and development is very promising.  This evaluation is based on the following points:\n\n      1.  Laser-based ultrasonic system was successfully developed for use in wave velocity evaluation of geologic materials;\n\n      2.   Accurate and stable measurement of wave travel velocity has been achieved by using the laser-based ultrasonic instrumentation on a variety of rock materials;\n\n      3.   The linear acoustoelastic model used in the stress assessment demonstrated sufficient accuracy in rock materials; and\n\n      4.   Rapid development of optical engineering during the period of proposing and performance of this Phase I project presented several significant advances, particularly in the area of fiber laser and fiber optics technology, that will directly address the key technical issues in the subsequent research and development, and make it more practical in realizing the goals in the Phase II study.\n\n      An US utility patent application has been filed with USPTO (Appl.# 13/095,750)  to protect the research concept from unauthorized use.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/27/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: June Wang"
