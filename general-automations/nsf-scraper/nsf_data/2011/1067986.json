 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the Tiwanaku civilization (AD 500-1000), one of Native South America's earliest state societies, monumental public architecture played an important role in the social and political organization of society. Were Tiwanaku public buildings the palaces of governors or priests designated by a centralized state and religion? Or were they temples for the coming together of many diverse cults and groups within a pluralistic pre-Inca society?  Unfortunately, while we have some information about highland Tiwanaku's magnificent architecture and stone carving style, relatively little is yet known about the functions of Tiwanaku temples, most of which are located in the wet altiplano region, where perishable architecture and artifacts are seldom preserved. \r\n\r\nThis project will address this problem by studying the Omo Tiwanaku temple, located in the lowland desert Tiwanaku province of Moquegua, Peru. Pilot excavations found excellent preservation of Omo's brightly painted architecture, including perishable roofing and wall materials, and a small sample of possible residential remains, and ritual paraphernalia including ceramic drinking vessels and censers, sea urchin spines, malachite beads, textiles including indigo tapestry fragments and sacrificial offering caches of llama bone, shells, starfish, and coca leaves. Area excavations of the entire structure will define detailed room access patterns and permit exposure of  the floors and internal features of entire rooms, while maintaining careful control over the context of artifacts, faunal and botanical materials. All excavated fill will be carefully screened at \u00bc\", with soil samples from all floor and features processed through progressive fine screens for botanical faunal and lithic and bead samples. This \"household archaeology\" methodology will permit the researchers to determine the component ritual and domestic activities of each room and feature, and the affiliation of the residents or staff active in each section of the temple.  \r\n\r\nFindings on the Omo temple's function and affiliation will be analyzed in light of recent work on public buildings in the Bolivian homeland of the Tiwanaku civilization, as well as the P.I.'s extensive prior research on the household and mortuary archaeology, settlement patterns, and iconography of the Tiwanaku province in Moquegua. Competing models of provincial temple functions will be evaluated, contrasting centralized state ritual practices vs. confederative ritual patterns, and internationalist models of practices, potentially with non-Tiwanaku and/or Wari participants also taking part. Results will inform an ongoing debate on the degree of central control in the Tiwanaku system and contribute to the comparativist conversation on state and ritual in early expansive state societies.",

Tiwanaku was one of the earliest state societies in the Americas and an important ancestor of the Inca empire. Our team&rsquo;s excavations at the Omo M10 Temple site in Moquegua, Peru studied how monumental public structures reflect the origins of political, as well as religious practices in the Americas. Tiwanaku is the world&rsquo;s only high altitude ancient civilization, but left us no written records, so art and archaeology are our only ways to understand how this important Native American state society worked. This research project also provided valuable international archaeology training to seven UC San Diego graduate students and 38 UC San Diego undergraduate students over three field seasons, and a valuable opportunity to work with 20 Peruvian colleagues, students, and technicians.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Omo Temple was visible on the surface as a massive structure of three stepped platforms 120 meters in length (M10A), plus and a lateral cemetery platform (M10B). The temple was set within the larger Tiwanaku town site of Omo, dating to the Tiwanaku state expansion to this agricultural region in the 7<sup>th</sup> through 11<sup>th</sup> centuries. Our team&rsquo;s goals were to excavate large areas of the Omo Temple to discover the building plan and access patterns, and carefully collect artifacts in context to identify the functions of the temple&rsquo;s many rooms. Highland Tiwanaku temples usually have poor preservation, and little was known about their internal divisions, which were built of perishable materials. Omo&rsquo;s excellent desert preservation allowed us to find interior walls, doorways, stairways and other features, defining rooms and patterns of access between rooms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2010, 2011 and 2012, we precisely surveyed the Omo temple, then excavated a large part of the temple&rsquo;s &ldquo;upper courtyard&rdquo;, where the most complex architecture is located. Our excavations in the upper court found 31 interior rooms and patios built of precisely cut stone blocks and adobe. We also excavated a sample of the middle court, the lower court, and the lateral cemetery platform called \"M10B\", where we defined the platform&rsquo;s terrace faces, perimeter wall and prepared floor surface and stone cribs used for construction fill. Eleven late Tiwanaku tombs were excavated in the \"M10B\" Sector, but these were stratigraphically placed after abandonment of the plaza features.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The construction of the M10A temple was remarkably precise and symmetrical. The boundaries of the three lower, middle and upper platforms and their major subdivisions laid out precisely with snap lines, of which impressions were left in the floor surfaces. However, within the subdivisions of each major enclosure, the 2010-2012 findings also indicate some variation in the pattern and the contents of the individual rooms between the two sides of the structure (table 3). Rituals or meetings in the sunken court were presided over by a central idol and a priest or governor who sat on a large U-shaped throne or altar&nbsp; in a special &ldquo;audiencia&rdquo; room behind the sunken courts. Detailed plan and profile views were prepared, allowing 3D architectural reconstructions using Google sketchup and autocad programs.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>A total of 87, 4 x 4m units, with a total of 265.59 cubic meters of fill, were excavated and screened in the field.
