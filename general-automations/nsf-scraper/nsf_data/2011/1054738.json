 "awd_abstract_narration": "Network resource allocation deals with efficiently managing the\r\nscarce resources available with the objective of providing us\r\nwith practical algorithms to achieve high performance in\r\nwireless networks. On the other hand, network information\r\ntheory develops conceptual tools to build new mechanisms to\r\nexploit the full capacity of wireless networks. Currently there\r\nis a significant gap between the information theoretic\r\ncapacities of wireless networks and the performances achieved\r\nby existing resource allocation schemes.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to bridge these two separate perspectives to close\r\nthis performance gap. To that end, it develops practical network\r\nalgorithms over an underlying infrastructure of multiuser channels\r\nalong with the appropriate information theoretic mechanisms. To achieve\r\nthis task, it proceeds along the following main research thrusts: (1)\r\nnetwork design, which involves the optimal construction and dynamic\r\nupdate of multiuser channels; (2) network control, based on joint\r\noptimization of physical and the network layers and the development of\r\nthe necessary stochastic optimization tools; (3) design of\r\nlow-complexity multiuser channel schedulers with a near-optimal\r\nperformance; (4) performance evaluation of the developed algorithms\r\nthrough real link-level measurements.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the research has the potential to give us performance\r\ngains by more than an order of magnitude, which will enable the design\r\nand implementation of faster, more reliable, and more robust wireless\r\nnetworks operating under a variety of conditions. Dissemination of the\r\nresearch will be achieved by submitting the results for publication in\r\nrefereed scholarly journals, presentation in conferences and symposia,\r\nand lectures and workshops in academic and industrial settings.",
