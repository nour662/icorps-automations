 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Twin Cities Urban Sustainability Forum (TCUS Forum) will include a main two-day symposium to be followed by a series of follow-on workshops that would occur over one year. The main symposium would include a mix of local, national, and international speakers, focused around five cross-cutting themes: (1) organization of a translational research framework for urban sustainability; (2) adaptation of governance for cross-disciplinary approaches to long-term sustainability; (3) use of technology; (4) forms of collaboration among academics and practitioners from multiple sectors; and (5) integration of urban ecosystems research and urban sustainability practice into a translational research framework. Both speakers and participants (120-160 total) will be a mix of academics and practitioners from diverse fields, including but not limited to urban planning, landscape architecture, ecology, engineering, and water resources.  The follow-on workshops will explore these themes to further articulate a framework for translational research, while at the same time turning the framework into practice. The workshop process itself will also be studied to gain insights to develop the translational research framework. Evaluation will include pre- and post-surveys of workshop participants, key interviews, content analysis of workshop notes, and participant observation to conduct a rigorous analysis of the workshop outcomes for publication.  The proposed TCUS Forum and follow-on activities to develop a translational research process would have major practical significance in facilitating the goal of attaining sustainable cities. In addition to the intellectual merit of developing a translational research framework for publication, the TCUS Forum, including follow-on workshops, would be would itself be a major outreach activity, with considerable potential benefit to sustainability efforts in the Twin Cities region and potentially other urban regions as well. Findings from the TCUS Forum will be integrated with the National Academy of Sciences regional urban sustainability series. Findings will be presented at one or more national conferences and will be incorporated into an Urban Ecosystems Brown Bag Seminar and a Freshman Seminar on sustainable urban living.\r\n\r\n\r\nBruce Hamilton\r\n10/16/10",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe science of urban sustainability is developing rapidly among various academic disciplines (e.g., engineering, planning, ecology).  Unfortunately, there is often a mismatch between the knowledge that the practitioner community needs and the knowledge produced by academic research. Moreover, research findings are often published in disciplinary journals and not \"translated\" into useable knowledge for practitioners.  Hence, we developed the Twin Cities Urban Sustainability Forum (TCUS Forum) with four goals: (1) strengthen and expand linkages among the region\u00c6s practitioner and academic communities; (2) identify research priorities (3) develop conceptual linkage between urban ecosystems and urban sustainability research and practice; and (4) develop a framework for translational research related to urban ecosystems and urban sustainability. \n \nThe main event was the TCUS Forum, a regional symposium held Nov. 11, 2011.  About 120 people attended, with attendees from various cities, government agencies, nonprofits, and universities (see tcusforum.umn.edu).  The main symposium was followed by a series of three smaller workshops.  These led to a consensus on research priorities: water, sustainable energy, urban food production, climate adaptation, equity, and public infrastructure.\n \nIntellectual Merit\nThe TCUS Forum advanced the idea of incorporating principles of urban ecosystem science into the arena of urban sustainability.  As an example, several research projects completed since 2011 have examined nutrient flowpaths in urban landscapes from an ecological perspective, leading to potentially more effective and cost-efficient ways to reduce eutrophication of urban lakes, an urban sustainability goal.\nA peer-reviewed journal article, now in development, will discuss relevant literature from a variety of fields related to translational research.  In addition, the article will highlight the outcomes of the Urban Sustainability Translational Research Workshops, with a focus on presenting a generalized framework for facilitating translational research priorities and projects among practitioners and researchers\n \nBroader Impacts\nWithin the Twin Cities Region, the project served to bring sustainability practitioners and academic researchers together around the topic of urban sustainability, often for the first time.  Many certified urban planners who attended received professional development credits through the American Planning Association.\nIn many ways, the TCUS Forum started a network connecting disciplines within the University of Minnesota and between academics and sustainability professionals in the community. This network continues to evolve, particularly with regional cities and watershed districts. Several examples that have been led by participants in the TCUS workshops include:\n1.     An ongoing interaction a faculty research group studying nutrient flowpaths in cities and a local watershed district that has included extensive data sharing by the watershed district and, conversely, research workshops to share findings with the watershed district;\n2.     The development of outreach workshops to enable cities to translate findings from a novel street sweeping experiment to their own cities.\n3.     A follow-on workshop \"Building Knowledge Bridges\", led by the commissioner of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), to foster research interactions between the University and MPCA. \n4.      A NSF-sponsored Urban Climate Institute Workshop held at the Science Museum of Minnesota in November 2013.\nNationally, interactions during the TCUS Forum helped to catalyze development of a NSF sponsored Research Coordinating Network Sustainable Cities - People and the Energy-Climate-Water Nexus, which is now in its second year.  More broadly, the TCUS Forum project has contributed to an emerging network of scholars, with within the U.S. and internationally, from various disciplines, focused on the science of urban sustainability.  \n\n..."
