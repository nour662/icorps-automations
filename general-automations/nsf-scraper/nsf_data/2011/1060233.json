The major project activities include: developing and implementing a Project-based Learning cohort model within ICC Engineering, enhancing student professionalism through workshops, mentoring the S-STEM cohort, improving retention to degree achievement, etc. The project is expending recruiting efforts into a metro area with large populations of African American, Hispanic, Somali, and Hmong people. The Northeast Higher Education Office of Institutional Research is assessing the impact of the project.  The project results are being disseminated in conjunction with the dissemination of the institution's NSF STEP project results.",

The PBL cohorts were self-selected student groups that meet for four hours per day, every day, in an integrated approach of general physics 1, static mechanics, and an engineering design and professional development courses. The integrated learning took place to support student work on projects with outside partners/sponsors.&nbsp; Examples include water runoff capture at a local swimming beach, the SHELL Eco-marathon urban concept car competition, SAE Mini-Baja, and design projects for local industries and partners. These PBL cohorts created a strong learning community, developed the students&rsquo; sense of engineering identity, developed professional skills, and created a connection between the learning outcomes for the courses and the applicability to their project work.</p>\n<p>During the granting period, the PBL curriculum maintained two PBL cohorts each year. Professional development workshops, along with personal mentoring, were the weekly events for all S-STEM scholars. &nbsp;The broader impact has expanded to regional high schools. As the engineering program recognizes the need for a long-term sustainable recruiting model and promotion of engineering in its rural region, it will partner with regional high schools to expose high school students to engineering project work utilizing the Purdue University EPICS curriculum. Starting fall semester 2017, the engineering program will partner with approximately twenty area high schools in delivering a high-quality engineering and solids modeling PBL experience.</p>\n<p>Of the 156 students enrolled in the program, 27 are from STEM under-represented groups. Of the 130 unique students who have earned this scholarship for one or two years, 119 have either graduated with a STEM bachelor&rsquo;s degree or are still in good standing and in progress (92% success). This level of retention and student achievement is quite successful for the program&rsquo;s student population of predominately first generation, PELL eligible students. Students involved in the program expressed a high degree of satisfaction; two-thirds rated the experience as 8 or higher on a ten-point scale.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Intellectual Merit: The primary emphasis of this project is the development of learning community-based model for PBL in a lower division engineering program for developing the student outcomes spelled out in national reports such as The Engineer of 2020 and ABET. It is intended as a contrast with a heavy emphasis on topical material that characterizes many of the engineering programs throughout the region, nation, and world. Broader Impacts: Successful completion of this project provides an example application of PBL in a public two-year community college setting. The recently developed high school model will increase the number of regional students interested in pursing engineering.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/11/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Derek&nbsp;C&nbsp;Fox</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1060233/1060233_10066300_1494470608829_IMG_4632--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1060233/1060233_10066300_1494470608829_IMG_4632--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Formal Dinner\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1060233/1060233_10066300_1494470608829_IMG_4632--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Formal Dinner\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">ICC and IRE students joined together for formal dinner after engineering ethics conference.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Derek Fox</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Derek&nbsp;C&nbsp;Fox</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Formal Dinner</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1060233/1060233_10066300_1494470763346_IMG_42292--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1060233/1060233_10066300_1494470763346_IMG_42292--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Iron Range STEM Showcase\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1060233/1060233_10066300_1494470763346_IMG_42292--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Iron Range STEM Showcase\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Presentation of PBL project.
