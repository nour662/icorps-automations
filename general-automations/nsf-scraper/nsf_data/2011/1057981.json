 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Catalina Achim of Carnegie Mellon University, David Waldeck of University of Pittsburgh, and David Beratan of Duke University will develop hybrid inorganic-nucleic acid structures and study charge transfer through these structures with the goal to direct and control charge flow on length scales up to tens of nanometers. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) building blocks that contain electroactive units will be used, together with complementary nucleic acids (DNA or PNA) as a template for the building blocks, to self-assemble and form preprogrammed electroactive assemblies. The key feature of the proposed research is the general and modular approach to incorporate inorganic or organic charge transfer components at predefined spatial locations in a nucleic acid-based structural scaffold. The team of researchers with complementary expertise (synthesis, characterization, and theory) will collaborate to define the synthetic methodologies, to develop the predictive models, and to quantify the structure and the function of these novel electroactive, supramolecular structures. The broader impacts of this collaborative research program originate from: (1) the creation of new paradigms for charge transfer, (2) the creation of new pedagogical tools for science education that make use of cyber-infrastructure, and (3) outreach activities that enhance diversity in the STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nThis work will enhance our fundamental understanding of charge transfer in nano-size, supramolecular structures that mimic similar-size structures present in biological systems.  Ultimately such work could lead to a general approach for integrating electronic platforms with biological systems.",

We examined how the nature of the experiment affects the results and the mechanism of the charge transfer through the molecule.  In particular, we compared measurements in which the two ends of the molecule are connected to electrodes (a molecular conductance measurement) to the case in which only one end is connected to an electrode and the other end has a molecular unit that can accept an electron (an electron transfer rate measurement).  Then we examined whether the current measured in the conductance experiment is correlated with the rate constant in the rate measurement. We examined this dependence for different types of molecules and different lengths of related molecules.  In contrast to the predictions of the simplest theoretical models, we found that the conductance and the rate constant display a power-law relationship for a given class of molecules, and a lack of correlation when a diverse group of molecules is compared.

In particular, fluctuations of the nucleic acid backbone affect the local electric field, which in turn broadens the energy levels that are involved in the electrons\u00c6 transit through the molecule.  In some conventional descriptions of electron transfer, fluctuations act to lower the charge transfer rate; this has led us to develop a new theoretical model that accounts for the role of fluctuations explicitly and reveals that a new mechanism can manifest itself under the right conditions.  \n\nBroader Impacts.  \n\n A high-school student, fourteen undergraduate students, ten graduate students, and three post-doctoral associates have worked on this collaborative project.
