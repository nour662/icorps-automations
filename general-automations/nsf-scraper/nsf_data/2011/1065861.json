 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increased diversity of living organisms from the poles to the tropics is one of the most pronounced features of life on Earth. But it still lacks an explanation. One universal feature of this relationship, as seen across the land, oceans, lakes and rivers, is that hotter environments have more organisms of all kinds: animals, plants, and microbes.  In this study, a big picture, or macroecological, approach will be used to study the effect of temperature on biodiversity. It will generate mathematical models for how temperature, through its effect on chemical and biological processes, affects ecological interactions and patterns of biodiversity. The models will be tested on three kinds of organisms that play key roles in forests: trees that produce leaves, small animals that eat decaying leaves and other material from plants, and microbes that consume whatever remains.  Standardized field surveys along a gradient of increasing temperature from a high-elevation conifer forest in Colorado to a tropical rainforest in Panama will be combined with controlled experiments in the field and laboratory to document changes in genetic diversity, functional diversity and ecological processes.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will predict impacts of global climate change on biodiversity and ecological processes, topics of major concern to policymakers and society. The project will also train a new generation of undergraduates, doctoral students, and postdoctoral scientists in the new multi-disciplinary, multi-investigator, collaborative research needed to address the challenging environmental problems that societies face.",

One of the central claims of biology is that there are more different kinds of organisms in warm and wet environments but increasingly fewer in colder environments. Variation in temperature emerges again and again as a dominant factor. But there is little consensus on the underlying mechanisms.  One dominant hypothesis is that in warm and wet environments organisms grow faster and rates of evolution are quicker because warm temperatures speed up the cellular metabolism of organsisms where as cold environments slow down cellular metabolism.\n\nOur original Macrosystems proposal used Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST) asked why warm environments were frequently more diverse. MST allows us to assess the role of temperature and differences between organisms such as their body size, and traits that characterize differences in the form and functioning of organisms. To answer that question and we set up three sampling protocols&mdash;one aimed at trees, one aimed at soil microbes and invertebrates, and the other aimed at compiling data from past published studies in order to extend our findings across other organisms and locations. \n\nDiscovery 1 &mdash;Temperature is not a major driver of diversity but instead body size is the most important driver.  Perhaps the single most transformative result thus far was the discovery that the slope of latitudinal gradient of diversity (a measure of the difference in diversity between hot and cold sites) was not determined by temperature. Instead, the slope declined with the body size or the organisms we studied. Plus, the range of diversity found within a site expanded as you move from trees to inverts and microbes (Fig 1). Put another way, if we focus on the body size, not the temperature, component of MST, you discover that the latitudinal gradient, long thought to be a near-universal law, is in fact a function of the body mass of a group of organisms that is investigated.  Interestingly, the biogeography of diversity for the smallest organisms is mostly within a biome and not between.  We suspect these findings are because small organisms have such a high rate of growth.  As a result, smaller organisms have had effectively more evolutionary time to increasingly colonize and diversify in increasingly colder environments.\n\nDiscovery 2 &ndash; Temperature is not a main driver of plant metabolism across broad global temperature gradients because plants can regulate their body temperature.   \n\nThis discovery questions a central paradigm in biology and ecology.
