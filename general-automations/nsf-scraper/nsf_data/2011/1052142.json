 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will investigate a previously unsuspected hormonal mechanism in insects that is involved in regulating the maturation of immature tissues into their adult form.  Specifically, the project will ask whether it is necessary for the invertebrate nuclear hormone receptor Ultraspiracle to bind to the hormone methyl farnesoate for proper differentiation of immature organs and tissues into their adult counterpart (especially during metamorphosis).  This hypothesis will be tested in a living model organism, the fruit fly, from two different directions: (1) by challenging the ability of the natural internal methyl farnesoate found in the fly to bind mutated nuclear receptors, and (2) by challenging the natural receptor with unnatural levels of methyl farnesoate.  This project will have two significant impacts on science and the economy in the United States.  First, this project will provide advanced training for undergraduates in modern techniques of molecular biology.  Second, this project may provide important information on a new and vulnerable hormonal pathway, specific to insects (including those that cause damage to economically important crops).  This knowledge can be used in the development of target of selective, and therefore safe, insect control agents",
