 "awd_abstract_narration": "Doctoral student John Michels (University of Illinois at Chicago), with the guidance of Dr. Molly Doane, will undertake research on the processes of class transformation currently being experienced in rural areas of North America and elsewhere. This research will be carried out in the Almaguin Highlands, Ontario, Canada, where working-class spaces are being transformed into upper-class residential and commercial zones. These processes recast the countryside from a place of work to a place of leisure, sometimes generating both tensions and alliances between various groups of residents over proper uses and meanings of rural space. \r\n\r\nThroughout the course of the project the researcher will carry out both ethnographic and archival research. Archival research will take place in village offices, village and university libraries, and provincial governmental offices. The ethnographic portion includes participant observation and a series of in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Activities include regular attendance at community meetings, open houses, job fairs, festivals, food drives, fundraisers, and other social events. Additional time will be spent with participants as they go about their daily activities at their places of employment and in their homes. Furthermore, a series of 200 semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a sample of 100 informants over the course of the project. \r\n\r\nBy ethnographically tracking these changes from labor-oriented rural production to leisure-oriented rural consumption, this study promises to help theorize the processes involved in the transformation of rural landscapes wherever they are found. Findings from the research will also be useful to planners and policy makers concerned with encouraging the beneficial effects and ameliorating the less beneficial ones for affected residents. Funding this research also contributes to the training of a graduate student.",

The goals and objectives of this project are to better understand the causes and consequences of land use changes in rural North America. More specifically, this research examines how these changes have affected various groups of rural residents. Modern day rural North America has witnessed the loss of many jobs in extractive industries. These changes have often been devastating to people working in agriculture and forestry, particularly those with smaller operations. In many rural areas, forestry and agriculture have been replaced with real estate, recreational, and tourism development. By focusing on these changes, I explore the transformation from an economy built on farming and natural resource extraction to one built on real estate development and leisure. These transformations have led to disagreements regarding &ldquo;proper&rdquo; uses of rural space in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Both the conflicts and alliances that have emerged as a result of these changes are a major focus of my work.</p>\n<p>As a result of this research, a number of conclusions have emerged, including the following: 1. New kinds of wealth have made inroads in the Almaguin Highlands. One example is the recent increase in higher-end residences, including new homes built by retirees who have recently relocated to the area, and seasonal homes for summer cottagers. Some working-class residents oppose new residential development plans, citing that they have led to higher taxes and increased stratification. However, other residents, for example tourism operators and vendors at small-scale farmers&rsquo; markets, have embraced these changes because they have led to increased sales. Furthermore, municipal councilors assert that these new homes are beneficial to the tax base. 2. New residents, including retirees and cottagers, have become increasingly involved in local politics. This involvement is not always seen in a positive light by long-term residents. According to one individual, people who retire to the area tend to be against<em> </em>development. This irritates many long-term residents. A local business owner stated, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the reason there <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> development - the retired people who have saved their whole lives to be here say &lsquo;no way.&rsquo;&rdquo; 3.
