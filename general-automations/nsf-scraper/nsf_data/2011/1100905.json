 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of George Fleming, a Research Professor at Yale University.\r\n\r\nWhen the interactions within a physical theory are strongly coupled, many traditional analysis techniques are no longer suitable and one must perform direct numerical calculations of quantities such as scattering amplitudes and interaction rates.  Such an approach typically involves what is called \"lattice gauge theory\". In this project, Professor Fleming aims to use lattice gauge theory techniques in order to study strongly-coupled physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.  Although the strong interaction modelled by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is well understood, Professor Fleming seeks to understand how the nature of strongly-coupled interactions changes as one explores more general classes of theories beyond QCD.  Such theories might ultimately be relevant if the LHC finds evidence of strongly coupled dynamics underlying electroweak symmetry breaking.\r\n\r\nThis project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  Professor Fleming has an established record of incorporating undergraduate students into his research program, with a strong emphasis on mentoring students from underrepresented groups and from predominantly undergraduate institutions. Lattice gauge theory calculations of many physical observables essentially involve extracting exponentially decaying signals from noisy time series data generated in Monte Carlo simulations. Many other scientific fields, e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and signals processing, share common challenges in data analysis of exponential time series. Undergraduates often choose this research topic because the skills they learn remain useful even if they move into other scientific fields later in their careers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAt the beginning of this grant, it was still a very much open question whether a Higgs boson existed and whether or not it would be discovered at the Tevatron in the US or the Large Hadron Collider in Europe. The Lattice Strong Dynamics (LSD) collaboration, with the PI as co-spokesperson, were exploring composite Higgs mechanisms which could replace the usual Higgs mechanism of the Standard Model.  The collaboration made a number of major contributions to the field, including calculationing the deviations due to a composite Higgs mechanism which might appear in precision tests of the Standard Model.  The collaboration also spent substantial computational resources mapping out the space of strongly-interacting theories which might contribute to such a composite Higgs mechanism.  This included studies of how the strength of the strong interactions was influence by changing the number of fermion flavors present in the theory.\n\n \n\nBy the end of 2012, it was clear that the Large Hadron Collider had discovered a new boson with a mass of 125 GeV that looked very much like the particle predicted in the Standard Model.  For the LSD collaboration, this meant we focused exclusively on models of composite Higgs bosons which might mimic the behavior of the Standard Model Higgs boson.  We eventually decided to focus on a theory with a new SU(3) gauge interaction and eight flavors  of quarks colored under this interaction.  Based on the work of others, plus our work, it now seems this theory may have a composite scalar particle with properties similar to the Standard Model Higgs boson.\n\n \n\nAlso with the discovery of the Higgs boson, we decided to use our computational machinery to study other new physics beyond the Standard Model, namely the physics of composite dark matter.  It is now well established that dark matter exists and there is more dark matter in the universe than regular matter.  But, dark matter interacts only very weakly with regular matter which makes it quite hard to experimentally determine details about the dark matter, like does it have mass?  If so, how much?  Does it interact with itself?  Does it interact with regular matter other than through gravity?\n\n \n\nThe LSD collaboration then completed an initial study of composite dark fermion matter that could interact with the Standard Model via magnetic moments and showed that such dark matter candidates could exist if they had masses in the range of 20 TeV - 300 TeV.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George Fleming"
