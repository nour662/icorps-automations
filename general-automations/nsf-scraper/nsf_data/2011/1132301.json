 "awd_abstract_narration": "1132301\r\nCunningham\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nWe propose the development of a photonic crystal enhanced microscope (PCEM) as a\r\npowerful multimode imaging approach for quantification and visualization of the interactions\r\nbetween cells and surfaces. The PCEM is designed to utilize the properties of a photonic\r\ncrystal (PC) biosensor surface that is designed to produce narrow bandwidth optical resonances\r\nfor two distinct purposes. First, the resonant coupling condition of the PC is modified by cell\r\nattachment, and the PCEM is capable of producing images of the spatial distribution of cell\r\nattachment with sufficient resolution to quantify variations in the strength of attachment within\r\nindividual cells. Second, the PC surface enables efficient coupling to laser illumination, resulting\r\nin the ability to enhance the output of fluorescent molecules in close proximity to the PC by two\r\norders of magnitude, using a technique called \"PC Enhanced Fluorescence.\" The PCEM will be\r\nan enabling tool for a broad range of life science research and pharmaceutical screening\r\napplications that require characterization of the interaction between extracellular matrix\r\nmaterials and cell membrane-expressed proteins in response to cell growth, pro-apoptotic\r\nstimuli, forced differentiation protocols, chemotaxis, ion channel activation, transmembrane\r\nprotein activation, and proliferation. PCEM offers the ability to perform assays with a limited\r\nnumber of available cells for applications involving primary cells or stem cells. The proposed\r\nsystem builds upon the successful implementation and demonstration of the first PCEM system,\r\nwhich was designed and built for applications involving DNA microarrays and protein\r\nmicroarrays. The proposed instrument incorporates objective-coupled illumination from above\r\nand below the PC for simultaneous label-free imaging, bright field imaging, and enhanced\r\nfluorescence imaging with optics designed to optimize the sensitivity and resolution of each\r\nmodality when the PC surface is immersed in cell media. The system also incorporates a CO2\r\nenvironmental chamber to facilitate continuous monitoring of cells for extended periods of time.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nBiologists are developing a more sophisticated understanding of how cell membrane\r\ninteractions with surfaces, chemical stimuli, and other cells are modulated, and the role of\r\nintegrins, ion channels, G-coupled transmembrane proteins, and filapodia in fundamental\r\nprocesses such as migration, wound healing, differentiation, and apoptosis. Yet, there are few\r\ntools currently available that allow visualization and quantification of these processes. While the\r\ninitial set of demonstrated applications for PCEM will include cancer cell cytotoxicity, T-cell\r\ninduced apoptosis, stem cell differentiation, and cardiac cell stimulation, the system's\r\ncapabilities extend to any cell type and any process that can be carried out upon a surface. The\r\nenvironment at Illinois, in which the PI is an investigator within the NSF-sponsored Center for\r\nCellular Mechanics (CCMB) IGERT, and the NIH-sponsored Cancer Nanotechnology training\r\ngrant, and the location of the system within the Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory's\r\nBioNanotechnology Laboratory assures that the system will be included in multidisciplinary\r\ntraining programs. Users of the system will be comprised of faculty, graduate students, and\r\nundergraduate students from Engineering, Pharmacology, Animal Sciences, Microbiology, and\r\nImmunology. The project will develop general-purpose methods for studying cell-surface\r\ninteractions that can be used broadly in pharmaceutical screening and life science research -\r\nextending the applicability of photonic crystal biosensors. The PI has a successful track record\r\nof biosensor instrumentation invention, development, and commercialization.\r\nThe proposal also describes an education plan that is closely linked with the program's\r\ntechnical goals with impact upon graduate student research, undergraduate research,\r\nundergraduate classroom/laboratory learning, and teaching biosensing/photonics concepts to a\r\nUniversity-based all-girls middle school. The PI has a strong track record for involving\r\nundergraduate students in his research, and for making the technology developed under NSF\r\nfunding available in his ECE416 \"Biosensors\" course, both in the form of lecture topics and\r\nhands-on laboratory experience.",
