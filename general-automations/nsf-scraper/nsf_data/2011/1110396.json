 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genetic diversity is an important factor that assists in maintaining the health of a population.  Mating behaviors may be one way for organisms to increase the genetic diversity of a population.  For example, if a female mates with multiple males, her offspring will have greater genetic diversity than a female that mates with only one male.  This project aims to test for multiple mating, and determine if it assists in increasing disease resistance in a freshwater snail from New Zealand.  Molecular techniques including PCR and microsatellite analysis will be used to assess paternity.  A laboratory experiment will be used to create single-father and multiple-father families, which will then be tested for disease resistance.  Since multiple paternity has been found in one population, we expect to find multiple paternity in a second population.  We also predict that multiple paternity will increase the chance that some offspring will be disease resistant.  This research will contribute to many different areas of scientific research, including how genetics affect disease transmission, the evolution of reproductive behaviors, and generation of genetic diversity through mating decisions.  Resulting research is intended to contribute to the scientific community through publishing and presenting results and also to education through integration of outcomes in undergraduate course work.",
