 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on two at-risk first-year engineering student populations: (1) those that do not qualify for the first-year engineering fundamentals due to low scores on the ACT math test and on the institution's math placement test and (2) women in the honors program.  On average, these at-risk students comprise a third of the entering class and the program intends to increase the first-to-second-year retention for the low math score group from 45% to 70% and for the women honor students from 72% to 93% in order to increase the graduation rate by 10%.  Interventions for the students with low math score include special sections of precalculus, block scheduling, living learning communities, and summer bridge programs; interventions for the women honors students include research assistantships at the University and at the Oak Ridge National Lab and mentoring through an organized extracurricular program. The evaluation effort, which is being conducted by an experienced outside consultant, is assessing the project's effectiveness in reaching targeted students and the project's impact in achieving preliminary indicators and benchmarks and ultimately its overall goals.  Broader impacts include the focus on two at-risk populations that contain a disproportionate fraction of students from underrepresented groups.",

Over the course of the RISER program the PI and Co-PIs made presentations and published papers updating the community on their efforts and the outcomes. Ultimately, the RISER program?s goal was to increase the number of women and people from under-served populations into the pool of engineers, bringing a variety of different experiences and viewpoints and allowing for greater creativity and imagination when tackling technological problems.  Over 800 students were served by the program and graduation rates of the various classes and programs are just becoming available.  In many cases it is difficult to attribute an increase in retention since many other positive institutional changes were occurring during the same time period.  The Tickle College of Engineering (TCE) freshmen class increased by 80%, within the TCE the Cook Grand Challenge Honors Program, complementary to the university?s Chancellors Honors Program, was established and the number of honors students in engineering rapidly increased.  Two institutional changes that occurred include UTK hosting a Math Camp that complemented the RISER Math Camp, reaching out to students who scored less than 25 on their Math, and the establishment of an Office of Undergraduate Research which is growing and becoming an important aspect of the university and undergraduate students? experiences at the university.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Claudia J Rawn"
