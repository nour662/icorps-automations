 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social network services have transformed daily lives and have influenced most aspects of society in the developed world, including politics, entertainment, sports and education. These services provide information that is both generated and consumed by their users. In some cases it has resulted in billions of dollars of commerce, but in other cases the search for a revenue stream persists.   The true economic value of this information and its dissemination is neither understood today nor recognized by providers of online social network service.\r\n\r\nThis project entails a research approach combining the analysis of competitive market equilibria and their computational properties, analysis of online social networks and their communication properties, and cooperative game theory, to reach such an understanding and provide mechanisms to benefit from it.  The project will also illustrate and validate the mechanisms on case studies.  More specifically, the project aims to understand the impact of social influence on the Arrow-Debreu market model. The project investigates the nature of utility functions, the nature of social influence graphs, and the mix of traders in the information dissemination market.  It aims to understand the effects of these on the computational complexity of market equilibria as well as the convergence of market dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide fundamental insights on the economics of social information dissemination. It will enable a better understanding of these complex systems and will provide fundamental tools for more efficient and robust designs. A successful completion of the project will not only provide theoretical and technical contributions, but will affect the design and implementation of the next generation of social networks and the information market that exists therein.  The results can aid in the public understanding of such complex systems as well as inform policy debate.",

In a monopolistic scenario when there is a single provider that carries information traffic, network neutrality is beneficial to users.

As we rely increasingly on social networks, especially microblogging sites like Twitter and Weibo, to diffuse news information and inform our collective decisions, a major algorithmic problem is whether such networks make the most of a critical scarce resource: users' reading time. Using analysis of millions of tweets from recent news events, we prove that information filtering is present in today's microblogging: users who post less tend to 'select' such topical information to pick what is likely to be more popular. We prove that such information filtering is instrumental in building a diversity of news offering that accounts for audience with various involvements, or in the contrary leads to an unstable news landscape: depending on the greediness of audience / bloggers, an equilibrium can be reached to incentivize better news, whereas some policies create instability.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Xi Chen"
