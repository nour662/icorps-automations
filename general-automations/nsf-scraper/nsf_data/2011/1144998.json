This year?s Meeting is co-hosted by the University of Connecticut and Brown University and will be held in Hartford, Connecticut, from October 12-15, 2011, and will feature a one-day workshop, at least four plenary lectures, numerous research presentations, a variety of special sessions, and several valuable networking opportunities for members of the BME community. There will be a total of 14 parallel technical program sessions providing over 800 oral presentations and an additional 1,600+ in poster presentations. Special sessions will include several distinguished BME lecturers and a ?Meet the Candidates? poster session that will promote BME employment opportunities. The pre-conference workshop, ?BME-IDEA? will deal with important contemporary issues in Biomedical Engineering on technology transfer and commercialization. Other special sessions, including ?Career Alumni Panel?, Resume Review/Writing Workshop?, and ?BMES Town Hall Meeting?, will give participants an opportunity to understand the career of a biomedical engineer, how to apply for job opportunities, and learn about the current state of the society and discipline. A record 3,500+ attendees are anticipated for the 2011 meeting. The potential record attendance is based upon the very high number of abstracts received for the 2010 meeting (i.e., 2,182, which is a 23% increase over the number of submissions in 2009) coupled with the fact that conference-friendly Hartford is very conveniently-located in the Northeast between New York City and Boston. A booklet will provide program details to the participants of the conference. All technical presentations will come from one-page, peer-reviewed abstracts, which will be compiled in CD format and distributed to all registrants. Copies of the CD will also be provided to all co-sponsoring societies. Currently, the CD is envisioned to serve as the only technical proceedings of the meeting due to the large number of high-quality abstracts accepted. At this conference, at least four extremely high-quality plenary speakers are scheduled during a time with no other activities so that all conference participants may attend these talks as well as the workshops. The 2011 meeting currently has sponsorship commitments from six major sponsors, including the University of Connecticut, Brown University, Covidien, and Medtronic.",
