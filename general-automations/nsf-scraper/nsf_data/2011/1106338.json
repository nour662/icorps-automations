 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Dennis Clouthier of the University of Kentucky will use laser spectroscopic methods to study the electronic spectra of main group reactive intermediates, concentrating on free radicals containing phosphorus, arsenic, boron and group III metals.  These species will be generated by electron impact fragmentation of stable precursor compounds, cooled to temperatures of a few Kelvin in a supersonic expansion, and detected by laser-induced fluorescence and resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization.\r\n \r\nMany of these transient molecules are of interest as they occur as semiconductor growth intermediates. In addition, there is a high probability that the free radicals containing phosphorus and aluminum can be found in the interstellar medium once they have been identified and characterized in the laboratory. The spectroscopic information obtained from these transient species will provide necessary benchmark data for future studies of reactive species in industrial processes and chemical reactions. This project will provide training for a new generation of physical chemists in a technically demanding and challenging area of science in which there is a dearth of well-qualified practitioners.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis reserach involved the study of the spectra of ultracold reactive intermediates, concentrating on small molecules and free radicals containing boron, aluminum, arsenic and phosphorus.  Our approach was to use a variety of spectroscopic techniques to study the reactive intermediates in the gas phase.  The species of interest were generated by electron impact fragmentation of stable precursor compounds or laser vaporization of metals and subsequent reactions with precursor molecules.  In order to simplify complex spectra and obtain as much information as possible, the reactive species were prepared in supersonic free-jet expansions so that they could be studied at very low rotational temperatures under collision-free conditions.  Laser-induced fluorescence, wavelength-resolved fluorescence, stimulated emission pumping and microwave absorption or emission techniques were used as appropriate to characterize the cold radicals.\n\nIn our spectroscopic studies, we targeted a variety of species whose spectra were largely unknown or poorly understood.  These included aluminum-, arsenic-, phosphorus-, boron-, and metal-containing small molecules, as well as two cationic species.  From a fundamental point of view, the chemistry of phosphorus and arsenic compounds is often very different from their nitrogen analogs, which strongly motivated this work.  We also knew very little about the boron-containing free radicals, despite their likely intermediacy in a variety of industrial processes. We have also extended our studies to main group organometallic systems including AlCCH, AlC and AlC2, species of great interest as potential interstellar molecules.\n\nAlthough the research is fundamental in nature, it has a much broader impact.  Our interest in boron, aluminum, arsenic, and phosphorus species stems from their importance as reactive intermediates in processes used to grow semiconductors or modify their intrinsic characteristics.  Doping with group III and V elements substantially changes the properties of intrinsic semiconductors and our research was aimed at developing sensitive spectroscopic methods for detecting, identifying, and characterizing the free radicals that can be formed in such processes.  Reactive intermediates containing aluminum are also of current interest in astrophysics, as they are known to exist in interstellar gas clouds and circumstellar atmospheres.\n\n            The spectroscopic information obtained from this work provided necessary data for future studies of these reactive species in industrial processes and chemical reactions.  The data are also invaluable for laboratory studies of their reaction kinetics.  These spectroscopic studies have established important primary data about the molecular structures, energy levels, and electronic transitions of a series of intermediates for which little precise information was previously available.  The research also provided training for a new generation of physical chemists in a technically demanding and challenging area of science in which there is a dearth of well-qualified practitioners.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/26/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dennis J Clouthier"
