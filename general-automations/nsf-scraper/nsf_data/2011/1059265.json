 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's electric power grid is experiencing a significant transformation because of rapid developments in renewable energy and smart grid technologies. This transition inevitably demands significant transformative research on many rapidly arising issues while the operation, stability, and reliability of the existing power grid is not affected. \r\nThis project supports the acquisition of a modern real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation system to advance smart grid and renewable energy technologies. The project will model smart grid components in a multi-disciplinary manner and investigate the interoperability characteristics of renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, and \"smart\" loads within a smart microgrid framework. The project will result in advanced computational technologies efficient for simulation-based study of both long- and short-term dynamics of future ?mixed system? and ?mixed signal? power grid configurations. At the same time, the project will examine how to integrate energy and intelligent-agent-based computing and communication systems within a decentralized electric power grid.\r\nThe project will enhance the development of advanced technologies for the future smart power grid, reduce energy-related emissions, improve energy efficiency of all economic sectors, and strengthen the technological lead for the United States in the advanced computing and energy fields. The project will attract and retain more minority and female students to the computational energy system program and educate young engineers and scientists to meet the rapid developments in energy and cyber technology for the 21st century.",
