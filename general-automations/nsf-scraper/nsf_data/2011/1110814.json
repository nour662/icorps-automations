 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants contain a diverse array of fungi that cause no apparent harm, and may even benefit the host. These\r\n\"endophytes\" are especially prevalent in tropical forests, but it is not known how many types exist, nor how\r\ntheir diversity is distributed within- and between host species. This project will quantify endophyte\r\ndiversity in a lowland Amazonian tree species, and examine the relative importance of geographic distance\r\nand habitat in determining endophyte community membership. This will be achieved using cutting-edge\r\nDNA sequencing technology that allows direct examination of microbial communities, independent of\r\nconventional cultivation methods.\r\n\r\nFungi and other microbes have immense effects on ecological processes, often resulting from their\r\ninteractions with larger organisms. In the case of endophytes, the ability of a plant to respond to its\r\nenvironment may be partly mediated by its fungal partners. Because chemistry is the currency of host-symbiont\r\ninteractions, this project will reveal potential targets for drug discovery, as well as advance our\r\nunderstanding of fungal species richness and ecology. During the field component, undergraduates from a\r\nuniversity in Amazonian Peru will receive training in ecology, plant identification, and fungal culture\r\ntechniques. An undergraduate in the United States will receive training in basic molecular methods. Results\r\nwill be published in English and Spanish, to facilitate further study by scientists from the host region and\r\nabroad.",
