 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) now permeates most computing activities. The penetration of this technology in the daily lives has resulted in common users relying on its effectiveness and reliability. The mass marketing of multicores and general-purpose graphics processing units in home and office PCs and laptops has a potential for empowering even common users to become a technology contributor. Certainly, it is no longer sufficient for even basic programmers to acquire only the conventional programming skills. All this phenomena point to the need for imparting a broad-based skill set in parallel and distributed computing  t various levels, impacting Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CE) programs and related computational disciplines. However, the rapid change in computing hardware platforms and devices, languages, and supporting programming environments, and the research advances, more than ever challenges the educators what to teach in any given semester. Students and their employer face similar challenges on what constitutes basic expertise. The proposed activity includes all stakeholder experts working together and periodically providing guidance on restructuring standard curriculum across various courses and modules related to parallel and distributed computing. Immediate benefit would be for CS/CE students and their instructors with periodic guidelines on what aspects to cover in what courses.\r\nThe PI plans to  revise the preliminary version of the curriculum, and to hold a second round of competition for Fall-11 for early adopter status, supported by NSF and Intel. It is planned to have early adopter status competitions for Spring-12 and for Fall-12. EduPar-12 workshop to be organized at IPDPS-12 in Shanghai in May 2012, with expanded scope.",
