 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two opposing models of how natural communities develop after disturbance. One theory predicts that community composition will tend to return to the pre-disturbance state, regardless of the vagaries of early establishment. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the species that make up communities are largely determined by the order of arrival of colonizers. The unresolved question is: Do different arrival times of species produce different stable communities in the long term, or do plant communities on similar sites eventually end up with similar compositions? This study seeks to answer this question while at the same time assessing whether interannual temporal variation affects the long-term outcome of these processes.  Environmental variation across years (for example, variation in the amount and pattern of rainfall) can affect the results of experiments followed for multiple years, producing different results in different years. Similarly, rare climatic events may often drive long-term community structure. Despite this, most ecological studies are followed for only a single year, and the vast majority of ecological experiments are initiated in a single year. This multi-year research program will examine the plant community ecology of California grasslands, controlling for colonization order of plants in the context of year-to-year variation in rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe research has practical implications for ecosystem restoration. These include developing techniques to increase species diversity on restoration projects, and improving the success of projects by focusing planting efforts on years with highest likelihood of success, decreasing the cost of restoration by decreasing replanting. This research will also test whether rare climatic events are more important for plant communities than gradual changes in average climate, with implications for how we respond to climate change. In addition, this project will enhance the long-term relationship between our lab and the Student and Landowner Education and Watershed Stewardship (SLEWS) program, which brings high school youth (often from disadvantaged groups) into rural settings to assist in restoration projects on local farms. This program benefits not only the students and the farmers, but also the graduate student mentors.",

First, we demonstrated that we could give desirable plants a better chance of establishing in restoration projects by giving them a 'head start' of either two weeks or one year (called \"priority effects\"). This could provide a helpful tool in settings where a) noxious weeds often choke out desirable plant species, and b) some species in a restoration mix are initially very competitive, and exclude other desirable plants in the mix. For example, native perennial grasses can quickly dominate a restoration site, leaving the planted native wildflower species with little room to establish. Planting the wildflowers a year earlier than the grasses results in a richer plant community. We also showed that planting individual species in patches (rather than fully intermixed), could produce similar priority effects. In addition to publishing several papers documenting the strength and durability of these priority effects, we have produced a review that includes suggestions for how restoration practitioners could incorporate priority effects into their projects. Second, we demonstrated that even subtle differences between sites and between planting years can profoundly shift the outcomes of restoration plantings in general, and of the importance of priority effects in those plantings. These results suggest that we need to do a better job at testing the generality of our research, since most ecological field experiments are currently initiated in a single year at a single site. Third, using watering experiments embedded in our overall design and statistical analyses across our many experimental trials (four priority treatments at three sites over five planting years, with each of these 60 experiments replicated five times), we were able to show that a substantial amount of the variation in our restoration plantings from year to year was due to the timing and amount of rainfall. Fourth, we were able to demonstrate that although these relationships with rainfall may hold over a \"normal\" range of years, they break down when rainfall patterns shift in the directions projected under climate change. This is a sobering result, but also a potential window into adaptive management for the coming decades. In addition to being useful for contemporary (and future) restoration practice, this research is expanding the horizons of basic plant population and community ecology, revealing the multi-faceted interactions that underlying biological systems. This research is contributing key information to the growing evidence that managed and natural biological systems are far more richly <em>contingent</em> than previously recognized. In total, we have published ten research articles in leading scientific and practitioner journals from this research, and anticipate many more. This grant also provided support and training for five doctoral students and a post-doctoral student, four of whom were women, and one of which is from an underrepresented group. Over a dozen undergraduate assistants were also involved.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/19/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Truman&nbsp;P&nbsp;Young</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1050543/1050543_10081430_1492657045209_IMG_0031--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1050543/1050543_10081430_1492657045209_IMG_0031--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Restoration plot at Hopland, CA\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1050543/1050543_10081430_1492657045209_IMG_0031--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Restoration plot at Hopland, CA\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">One of the priority plots at the Hopland site.
