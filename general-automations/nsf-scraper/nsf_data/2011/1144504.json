 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for \"Laboratory-Based Laws for Ice Shelf Evolution\" from the Antarctic Integrated System Science within the Office of Polar Programs. Studies investigating the dynamics of ice shelves are arguably one of the most, if not the most, important area of research if we hope to make reliable predictions about future global sea-level rise.  The dominant mass loss in Antarctic ice shelves occurs in one of two ways:  either via basal melt where the ocean interacts with the bottom of the ice shelf, or via calving of icebergs.  This award will include studies of both these processes.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The project will use laboratory and modeling studies to better understand the processes associated with basal melt beneath the ice sheets (ice-ocean interactions) and fracturing leading to calving of icebergs. Specifically the investigator will perform a suite of experiments in cold rooms available at CRREL (Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory) facilities in New Hampshire. In conjunction with the scale-model ice shelf laboratory studies, the team will use DNS (direct numerical simulation) to model the processes.  While others have done scale-model studies, such investigations are rarely (if ever) coupled with numerical modeling.  Combining the two is novel, and should lead to important new insights into ice shelf dynamics. One significant challenge will be to ?scale-up? laboratory results to processes relevant to the real world- hence the proposed work is very much proof of concept and appropriate for EAGER funding.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: An understanding of the dynamics controlling the loss of mass from ice shelves is critically important to understanding the future of global sea-level change. The results will be communicated to both the glaciology and modeling community.  The project will train one graduate student and promote interactions between CRREL (a federal lab) and NYU (an academic institution).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nWhen sea ice or icebergs melt in the ocean, a curious \"scallop\" pattern is formed at the ice-ocean interface.  These scallop features are ubiquitous in the polar oceans, with scallops of scale more than a meter to less than a meter being commonly observed.  The mechanism leading to formation of these features was investigated in this project using an ice-ocean laboratory flume, located in the CRREL experimental facilities in New Hampshire.  Experimental data was collected using a technique known as PIV (particle-image velocimetry) in which small particles were introduced into the water flowing over an ice surface.  Cameras tracked the motion of the particles and provided insight into the process by which water interacts with ice to create a scallop interface.   An analysis of the camera data revealed, that while the flow of water over the ice surface was turbulent, the long-term average of the flow field showed the clear existence of a \"standing\" eddy in the scallop, meaning that the scallop\u00c6s presence was impacting the fluid flow over the scallop, and vice-versa.  Thus a coupled mechanism is revealed whereby the scallop structure in the ice is reinforced by a standing eddy that transports warm water to the cold ice interface and the warm water in turn melts the ice, creating the scallop structure.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Holland"
