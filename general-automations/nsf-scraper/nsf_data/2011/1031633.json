The goals of the project are (1) to develop computational literacy as well as mathematical literacy and (2) encourage students to pursue STEM careers.",

Particularly, BMDML was developed at The Young People&rsquo;s Project (YPP), a not-for-profit math literacy organization that works with and through young people in cities across the country. At three YPP sites (Urban Northeast, Rural Midwest, and Urban South), college and high school students created a BMDML integrated computational and mathematical thinking plan of study for two YPP games (Flagway and Road Coloring) that were typically played over the course of a semester. In the activities, middle and elementary school students learned a combination of computer programming and computational thinking through the drag and drop software program Scratch, and mathematical thinking in either Flagway or Road Coloring. Young people then created video games in Scratch that addressed either the mathematics or game play of the two YPP games. BMDML served 17 college students as College Math Literacy Workers (CMLW), 77 high school students as High School Math Literacy Workers (MLW), and 163 middle and elementary school students as the outreach population.
