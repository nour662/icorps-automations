 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the US Ignite initiative, the National Science Foundation (NSF) seeks to demonstrate the potential and capacity of ultra-high speed broadband networks, seeding demand for and investment into their development. In coordination with other project components, including the communities that comprise the Ignite test network, the NSF plans to conduct a two-phase open innovation challenge, wherein individuals and project teams compete for prizes and funding to develop applications that make use of ultra-high speed networks. These applications will deliver innovative and valuable services in areas of national priority, including smart health, clean energy, cyber-learning, smart transportation, public safety, and advanced manufacturing. \r\n\r\nMozilla has a long history of designing and managing Open Innovation Challenges. The organization uses the challenge model to drive participation in shaping product development and innovation. Challenges pair the agility of open innovation, the generativity that comes from the freedom to propose new ideas, diverse perspectives, crowd sourced insight, and accidental encounter with resources and support for projects able to demonstrate measurable impact. Through US Ignite, Mozilla will leverage its experiences to drive ultra-high speed broadband application development.\r\n\r\nA successful U.S. Ignite prize competition will provide an accessible vision of what is possible with next-generation networks, demonstrate that potential with deployments addressing national priorities, and galvanize a network of gigabit application developers.",
