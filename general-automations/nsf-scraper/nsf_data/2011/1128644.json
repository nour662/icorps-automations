 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overview: We propose to investigate dramatic changes in electronic and photonic\r\nproperties of new functional devices based on the reversible metal-insulator transition\r\n(MIT) of vanadium dioxide. The electrical resistivity of VO2 changes by 4 to 5 orders.\r\nVariations in refractive index exceed 15%, giving an index contrast of greater than 3\r\nrelative to free space. This unique combination of properties motivates the study of its\r\nphase transition mechanisms, control of its properties, and development of terahertz\r\n(THz) functional components.\r\nIntellectual Merit: We will explore the fundamental physics of VO2 phase transition,\r\nparticularly when driven electrically in pulsed current mode or in gate electric-field mode,\r\nand develop new functional devices for THz switching and modulation applications with\r\nthe aim of reconfigurable manipulation. Through the study of phase transition\r\nmechanisms and factors to influence the transition ?speed? we will engineer the material\r\nstructure to achieve abrupt ?digital? switching and controllable percolative phase\r\ntransition for ?analog? modulation. The result will provide fundamental understanding of\r\nelectrically controlled metal-insulator transition and promote the application of phasetransition-\r\nbased materials for electronic and photonic applications.\r\nBroader Impact: Study of phase transitions will provide new opportunities to achieve\r\ninnovative functional devices. These devices will exhibit unprecedented operational\r\nprinciples for electronic and photonic applications, in addition to fundamental scientific\r\nunderstanding. The proposed components will find broad applications in THz technology.\r\nThe project provides excellent opportunities for interdisciplinary research education and\r\ntraining. Outreach efforts will attract new students, especially those from\r\nunderrepresented groups, to science and engineering fields.",
