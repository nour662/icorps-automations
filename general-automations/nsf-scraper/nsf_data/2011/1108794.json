 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on further development of constructive and\r\nrigorous asymptotic analysis of linear and nonlinear partial\r\ndifferential equations that arise in a number of important physical\r\napplications. The applications include (a) evolution of small\r\ndisturbances superposed on an oscillatory flow in a channel or pipe,\r\nof interest in transition to turbulence, (b) existence and stability\r\nof self-sustaining states in channel and pipe flows, believed to be\r\nomega-limits in intermediate Reynolds number turbulent flow, (c)\r\nnonlinear stability of steadily translating fingers and bubbles in\r\nHele-Shaw flow for small nonzero surface tension, of interest in\r\npattern formation, (d) ionization of Hydrogen atoms in time-periodic\r\ndipole fields of arbitrary frequency and amplitude.\r\n\r\n  Our understanding of the solutions of equations arising in fluid\r\nmotion and quantum mechanics is still very limited.  The present\r\nproject develops much needed new methods to study these problems.\r\nAmong the immediate applications outside mathematics we note for\r\ninstance that understanding turbulent fluid flow can lead to a more\r\nenergy-efficient transportation of fluids through pipes. Also, better\r\nunderstanding of ionization processes has many applications, including\r\noptimal propagation of very intense laser beams through the\r\natmosphere. Training of students --supported in the project-- will\r\nhelp maintain the high quality of research in the United States for\r\nthe coming generation.",
