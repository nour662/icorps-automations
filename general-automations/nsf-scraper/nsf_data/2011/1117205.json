 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current microprocessor systems are based on semiconductor logic gates, which employ electronic input and output signals and power supplies. Each type of logic gates has a specific input?output signal correlation pattern. Voltages can be simply high or low: digital 1 or 0, respectively. A critical feature, which contributes to the success of modern computers, is input-output signal uniformity: the same voltage value emerging as output of one gate can be admitted as input of another gate. Very large scale integration is a crucial component of modern silicon processors. The development of even more powerful processors depends on continued progress in miniaturizing their components. However, if current trends continue, conventional silicon chips will soon reach their physical limits. By then, their transistors will be so small that current leakage will become an insurmountable problem. It is believed that constructing computers in which computations are performed by individual molecules is the inevitable wave of the future (P. Ball, Nature 2000, 406, 118-120). \r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this project is the development of a first DNA-based nanocomputer, a biocompatible and smaller counterpart of the modern silicon-based processor. This project aims at the solution of the two major problems of molecular computation: the universal large scale connectivity of molecular logic gates and precise localization of logic gates in a nanoscale environment. A basic set of connectable DNA logic gates (NOT, AND OR) will be created. The DNA gates will be organized in a network that corresponds to an EX-OR logic function both in solution and on a two-dimensional DNA platform. Accomplishing the project will deliver the first connectable nanoscale logic units, a basis for the future DNA nanoprocessor. \r\n\r\nThis research will be integrated with education by introducing research topics into undergraduate teaching, students, research training at undergraduate and graduate levels, postdoctoral training.",
