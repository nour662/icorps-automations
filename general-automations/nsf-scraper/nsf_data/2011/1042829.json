 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since software is easier to configure, modify and re-use than hardware, an increasingly large portion of a medical device?s functionality is now being implemented in code. This presents considerable engineering challenges for both device regulators and manufacturers in terms of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the deployed software.  This NSF-FDA Scholar in Residence project focuses on the use of generic software architecture specifications for medical devices as a path to reducing the complexity of engineering medical device software. For manufacturers, generic device specifications can serve as a base artifact from which concrete implementations may be constructed. For regulators, they represent an artifact that can be modeled and used in evaluating implementations for adherence to a base set of safety requirements.  The primary goals of this project are to explore a generic infusion pump architecture that can be extended to different infusion pump classes while preserving the requisite safety properties in a trustable, verifiable manner. The project explores challenges for developing usable generic device software architecture specifications and for applying them: producing concrete device instances, constructing extended subclasses from the generic architecture while verifying that properties are preserved, and supporting regulators and manufacturers as they evaluate device software conformance to safety architectures.  The research employs model-checking, assertion-based verification, static analysis and reverse engineering to support assurance of safety-critical devices such as the Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) infusion pump.  The aim of the research is to provide an informative pilot study towards adoption of such techniques in device manufacturing workflows and regulatory regimes.  One of the driving goals of this project is to create techniques and approaches that will benefit patients (by increasing device safety), device manufacturers (by helping them cut development costs) and regulators (by enabling them to automate and formalize their regulatory activities).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAssurance cases are a promising new approach that allows developers of safety-critical products to present their case to the regulators, who are tasked with assessing whether the product is sufficiently well engineered to guarantee the necessary qualities of the product such as safety and effectiveness.  An assurance case collects evidence that the developed product is acceptable for the intended use, and adds a coherent argument that breaks high-level claims about the system into subclaims, and ultimately ties subclaims to evidence.  Currently, the FDA requires assurance cases for regulatory submissions of infusion pumps. \n\nHowever, given the current state of practice, medical device manufacturers often lack expertise to develop convincing and concise assurance cases, and FDA regulators do not have enough tools to effectively evaluate assurance cases.  This project has been initiated in order to gain understanding of the regulatory needs in dealing with assurance cases at the FDA, and use this understanding to develop ways to contructing assurance cases in ways that make evaluation easier, and evaluation methods that let regulators zero in on potential deviciencies in the argument or gaps in evidence.\n\nThe project has produced two kinds of results.  For assurance case development, we have proposed a new assurance case pattern that targets systems developed using model-based design.  The pattern can be instantiated by the system developers to match their development and V&amp;V approaches.  For assurance case evaluation, we have developed a structured methodology that combines subjective assessments by experts about sufficiency of individual pieces of evidence with automatic aggregation of these assessments within the argument structures.\n\nThe immediate outcome of the project, then, is to provide techniques to developers and regulators to convincingly evaluate the safety of future medical devices.  In particular, close interactions with the FDA experts throughout the project helped ensure that the results are obtained with the regulators' perspective in mind and that regulators are aware of the results and are well positioned to use them.\n\nBeyond the technical resuls, the project allowed students and postdoctoral fellows to gain first-hand understanding of real-world regulatory challenges in the medical domain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/19/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Oleg Sokolsky"
