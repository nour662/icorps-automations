 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to use seismic data to image Earth \r\nstructure and seismic sources based on modern numerical methods and \r\nimaging techniques. We will further develop and enhance software for the \r\nsimulation of 3D seismic wave propagation, with a particular emphasis on \r\ncomputing on Graphics Processing Units, rather than traditional Central \r\nProcessing Units, potentially providing an order of magnitude increase \r\nin simulation speed. The broader impacts of the proposal include \r\nopen-source software packages for the simulation of seismic wave \r\npropagation. Simulations based on these packages may be used to \r\ninvestigate seismic hazard and aid in the determination of tomographic \r\nimages of Earth's interior and earthquake source parameters. All \r\nsoftware developed during the course of the proposed research period \r\nwill be made freely available via the Computational Infrastructure for \r\nGeodynamics (geodynamics.org).\r\n\r\nThe simulations of seismic wave propagation account for heterogeneity in \r\nEarth's crust and mantle, topography&  bathymetry, seismic anisotropy, \r\nattenuation, fluid-solid interactions, self-gravitation, rotation, and \r\nthe oceans. The main intellectual merit of this project revolves around \r\nharnessing the power of the forward modeling tools to enhance the \r\nquality of images of Earth's interior and the earthquake rupture \r\nprocess. The approach is to minimize remaining between simulated and \r\nobserved seismograms based on so-called adjoint techniques in \r\ncombination with conjugate gradient methods, an approach we refer to as \r\n\"adjoint tomography\". Specifically, following a successful application \r\nin southern California, we will 1) develop open-source GPU-based forward \r\nand adjoint spectral-element solvers, 2) perform adjoint tomography of \r\nEurope, 3) further develop noise cross-correlation tomography based on \r\nadjoint methods, 4) move towards adjoint tomography of the entire \r\nplanet, and 5) extend the southern California and global \"ShakeMovie\" \r\ncyber infrastructure.",
