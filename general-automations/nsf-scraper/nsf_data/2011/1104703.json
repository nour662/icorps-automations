  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThree-manifolds are spaces which are locally three-dimensional, like\nthe universe we live in.  They can therefore be thought of as possible\nmodels for the shape of the universe.  Groups are algebraic objects,\ndescribing possible symmetry patterns; every space has an associated\ngroup, called its fundamental group.  A consequence of Perelman's\nGeometrization Theorem is that (most) three-manifolds are determined\nby their fundamental groups.  It follows that all the topology and\ngeometry of a three-manifold is somehow contained in this group, which\ncan be studied using geometric and algorithmic group theory.\n\nOne of the key research products of this grant was unanticipated in\nthe original proposal, but was an important ingredient in Ian Agol's\nresolution of the 30-year old \"virtual fibering\" conjecture for\nthree-manifolds.  This conjecture stated, roughly, that any\nnon-Euclidean three-manifold could be \"unwrapped\" finitely many times\nto obtain a particularly simple kind of \"twisted product\" manifold.\nThe PIs work with Agol and Daniel Groves gave a way to find an\ninfinite \"unwrapping\" with nice properties.  Agol then showed that\nthis infinite manifold could be cut into pieces and re-glued to give a finite\n\"unwrapping\" which was a twisted product.\n\nIn a second project, with Daniel Groves and Henry Wilton, we give a\ntheoretical algorithm for determining whether an abstract symmetry\ngroup is actually the fundamental group of some three-manifold.  Deep\n20th century work on undecidability says that such an algorithm cannot\nbe completely reliable in all situations, but we show that the\nrequired \"extra structure\" to make our algorithm reliable is as\nminimal as possible.\n\nThe algorithm described in the second project is entirely theoretical.\nHowever, another product of this research is software (jointly written\nwith Chris Cashen) for studying some group theoretic questions closely\nrelated to three-manifold theory.  Since other specialists may find\nthis software useful, we have made the source code public at\nhttps://bitbucket.org/christopher_cashen/virtuallygeometric.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/14/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason F Manning"
