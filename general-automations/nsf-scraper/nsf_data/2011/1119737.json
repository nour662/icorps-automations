Guidry\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support item for the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) for use aboard the R/V PELICAN; namely a new side A-frame.  This item will enhance safety and provide greatly enhanced support capabilities to science.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   The R/V PELICAN supports federally funded scientific research in the Gulf of Mexico in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, open house events, educational cruises, and involvement in the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center which is an intern-based training program for marine technicians.  PELICAN also provided significant federal agency science support following the Deep Water Horizon disaster in 2010.",
