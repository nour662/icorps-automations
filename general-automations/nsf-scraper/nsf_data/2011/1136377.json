 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the Kent State University Noyce Scholars Program the number of qualified teachers of high school mathematics and science completing the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) initial licensure program is on the way to doubling from its present level.  The program attracts freshmen and sophomores to the teaching profession through their participation in the summer program Upward Bound, a form of service learning.  Juniors and seniors are offered internships in an REU program that conducts research on aspects of secondary school student learning of mathematics and science.  The 50 Noyce Scholars themselves, both recently graduated STEM majors and returning STEM professionals, are engaged in an intensive graduate program qualifying them as teachers of secondary science and mathematics.  This last group is supported by Noyce Scholarships that cover the full cost of tuition.  Having completed the MAT degree, new teachers are supported through a support seminar during their first two years.  The program is possible because of long-standing and ongoing partnerships between Kent State's science, mathematics, and education departments, high-need schools in the area, and the TRIOS Upward Bound Program.  Unusual features of this program are its emphasis on service learning and on engaging undergraduates and graduate students in action research on science and mathematics learning.  Current research on learning also informs the design of the MAT curriculum.  Beyond the training of the teachers themselves, the project impacts an area with a severe shortage of STEM teachers, provides needed assistance to service projects each summer, and generates useful data on effective practices in STEM teacher training.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn August 2011, the National Science Foundation (NSF) approved the Kent State University Noyce Scholars Program, a proposal for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program.  A total of $1,082,889 was awarded for a 60-month program to begin in 2011 and expired August 31, 2018 (with two one-year, no-cost extensions).  The Kent State University Noyce Scholars Program endeavored to address the national shortage of secondary science and math teachers by providing stipends to support the teacher education of science and math Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) students. A unique aspect of this program was its use of service learning teaching experiences as part of a teacher education curriculum.  These service learning teaching events provided opportunities for prospective science and math teachers to employ various STEM teaching strategies and engage with students and their families at high needs school districts throughout Northeast Ohio.  Additionally, the project generated useful data about the role of STEM teaching service learning as an effective practice for STEM teacher preparation.\n\nThe project was guided by five objectives in terms of (1) providing 50 stipends for preservice MAT math and science teachers, (2) providing 50 STEM education internships for STEM undergraduates, (3) developing partnerships with Northeast Ohio school districts, (4) serving Northeast Ohio?s high needs youth through STEM teaching service learning activities, and (5) conducting research on the impact of STEM teaching service learning on preservice STEM teacher development.\n\nIn terms of outcomes for these five objectives, the Kent State University Noyce Scholars Program has largely accomplished its goals.  For Objective 1, the KSU project provided 45 stipends for preservice MAT math and science teachers to prepare them to teach in high needs districts.  Although several KSU Noyce scholars are still completing their programs, 31 of the 34 KSU Noyce graduates have already taught or are presently teaching in high needs school districts.  For Objective 2, over the seven-year period, 42 undergraduate STEM majors were supported for STEM education summer internships with community partners.  With respect to Objective 3, the KSU Noyce Scholars Program partnered with seven local high needs school districts for field placements and four districts for service learning events.  For Objective 4, thousands of local children in high needs school districts benefited from over 40 STEM teaching service learning events in the form of math/science family nights, winter STEM bag delivery, science fair judging, and community center STEM activities.  Finally, for Objective 5, several research projects resulted three published refereed manuscripts, five national/international conference presentations, one other conference presentation, and five presentations at Noyce Summits, to date.\n\nIn summary, the Kent State University Noyce Scholars Program sought to advance knowledge (Intellectual Merit) and benefit society (Broader Impacts) through STEM education. In terms of Intellectual Merit, the project yielded multiple publications and conference presentations about the role of STEM teaching service learning for the recruitment and preparation of STEM teachers.  In terms of Broader Impacts, the project supported the education of 45 preservice STEM teachers, engaged STEM undergraduates in STEM teaching, delivered hands-on inquiry STEM instruction to thousands of Northeast Ohio children, and developed and sustained several university-school-community agency partnerships.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/20/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lisa A Borgerding"
