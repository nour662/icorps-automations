 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is aimed at continuing and strengthening the regional workshop series `Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and their Representations.' The express purpose of the Workshops is to provide research level lectures for advanced graduate students and post doctoral students working in areas related to Lie groups, Lie algebras and their representations. Lie theory is a fundamental part of modern mathematics and plays a key  role in harmonic analysis, differential geometry, number theory, algebra, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics. \r\n\r\nThe workshops supported by this proposal take place over weekends three or four times a year in California and other parts of the Western US. They provide novel and stimulating research and study opportunities  for graduate students and junior researchers to become acquainted with research and researchers in the  US and visitors from other countries who are working in Lie theory and associated areas.",
