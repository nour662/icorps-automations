 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is conducted on simulations performed with the superparameterized (SP) version of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM, version 3), or SP-CCSM.  The atmospheric component model used in a coupled climate model typically uses a parameterization for convection, in which the effects of convection are estimated without actually resolving the convection. In superparameterization, the parameterization is replaced by a cloud resolving model at each point in the model's horizontal grid. In this way the climate model gains some of the benefits of a global cloud resolving model without the enormous computational expense of running such a high-resolution (7km or less) nonhydrostatic model over the globe. Based on a 20-year simulation performed as preliminary work, SP-CCSM produces a better tropical simulation than CCSM3, including improvements in the periodicity of El Nino/Southern Oscillation events, reduction in the classical double-ITCZ bias, and a more credible simulation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).\r\n\r\nTwo research objectives are addressed in this research: first, SP-CCSM and its component atmospheric model are used to evaluate the roles of surface fluxes, air-sea interactions, and small-scale convective processes in producing MJO events.  This research also considers the mechanisms through which the MJO affects the Asian summer monsoon.  Second, the work seeks to understand the effect of the MJO on El Nino/Southern Oscillation events in the equatorial Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe work has broader impacts through its potential to forecasts of MJO events, which have consequences for the Asian summer monsoon and weather in the United States.  Research results may also lead to improvements in the parameterization of tropical convection in weather and climate models.  In addition, the project supports a postdoctoral researcher, thereby providing for the next generation of scientists in this field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a large-scale, slowly-evolving convective disturbance that impacts weather throughout the tropics.  The cloudy part of the disturbance (i.e., the convection) is focused on the equator and spans ~5000 km of longitude (more than the width of North America).  As this convective envelope slowly shifts eastward, it regulates rainy and dry periods (such as monsoons), spawns hurricanes, and sometimes initiates El Nino events.  The disturbance generates so much atmospheric heating that is effects are often experienced at higher latitudes in the form of planetary waves that impact the jet stream.\n\n \n\nBecause the disturbance repeats every 30~60 days, predicting MJO evolution can help improve global weather forecasts.  Unfortunately, many models have poor MJO prediction skill.  Recent research has taught us that the large spatial scale and slow movement of the MJO is sensitive to how convection interacts with atmospheric humidity.  \n\n \n\nOther studies show that models can better simulate the MJO if changes to the underlying ocean are taken into account.
