 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Phase I Robert Noyce Teacher Education Scholarship program at Siena College recruits, certifies, and retains twenty-one unique high-achieving STEM majors to become teachers in high-need middle and high schools. In years 2, 3, and 4 of the project, seven new Noyce Scholars are selected and supported in their junior and senior years with $20,000 scholarships. A number of faculty from several STEM disciplines participate in the project.  The Siena Noyce Scholarship program benefits from partnership with the Schenectady City School District and several additional local schools that have significant high-need populations. The program implements a cohort strategy that builds on rigorous research-based undergraduate STEM programs. The program implements the viewpoint that STEM teachers should balance the content of authentic science, which should be the same for all students in a particular major, with practical preparation in education. The model also addresses and tests the importance of research experiences and interdisciplinary learning for STEM education majors as the basis for excellence in teaching. Assessments are measuring the effectiveness of attracting and retaining students, preparing them to teach in high-need schools, and retaining them as teachers.",
