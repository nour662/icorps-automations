 "awd_abstract_narration": "Estrogen, a steroid hormone is important for reproduction, social behaviors, cognition and the progression of several diseases such as breast and ovarian cancers.  It influences these processes by binding a specific receptor, the estrogen receptor (ER) alpha or the ER beta.  Traditionally, these receptors reside within cells and signal by slowly regulating the transcription of target genes.  However, estrogen can also rapidly activate kinases and increase calcium within cells via putative receptors on the cell membrane.  Dr. Vasudevan has previously demonstrated that estrogen, acting rapidly at the cell membrane can couple to increased transcription in the nucleus. This suggests that a novel integrated signaling pathway linking rapid cell membrane-initiated signaling to nuclear transcription is driven by estrogen in neurons.  This project will elucidate various components of this signaling pathway; starting with the idea that coupling occurs via ER alpha phosphorylation.  The importance of modification of the ER alpha that directly impacts ER alphafunction will be examined.   Lastly, the importance of this pathway in known estrogen-mediated changes in aggressive behavior and neuromorphology will also be examined.  Molecular biological approaches using ER in cell culture, and histochemical and behavioral analysis in animal models will be used to understand the significance of coupled-signaling.  Understanding this pathway in the framework of biological function will close a critical gap in our understanding of this controversial mode of estrogen signaling and introduce a new paradigm in steroid receptor biology, applicable to any hormone responsive tissue.  The activities in this project provide research opportunities not only for graduate students, but also for K-12 students and undergraduates, particularly those from minority and under-represented groups.  In addition, undergraduates and graduates will gain exposure and global experience in international collaborations, scientific meetings and by authoring research publications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur proposal was aimed at understanding the signaling pathways activated by estrogen in the brain and their relevance for behavior.  Estrogen is a steroid hormone that can bind the estrogen receptor (ER), a protein present in several areas of the brain and other tissues, which then acts to regulate gene expression by a process called transcription.  Since this model of signaling implies that estrogen receptors act in the nucleus of the cell, this mode is also called genomic signaling and is typically slow (over hours).  However, estrogens can also act by rapidly activating kinases or calcium flux within cells, in a mode of signaling called non-genomic signaling.  Non-genomic signaling has been controversial since there is a lack of evidence for: a) its importance in physiology and b) the identity of a protein that could act as a plasma membrane estrogen receptor (mER) for estrogen and that can initiate non-genomic signaling.  Our hypothesis was that E-dependent non-genomic action in neurons is coupled to transcription via the addition of phosphate groups to the ERa phosphorylation.  We also hypothesized that such coupled signaling is important in the way that estrogen increases aggression in males and increases spines in neurons.  In order to investigate this, we examined the location of the ERa, the role of non-genomic signaling in transcription and aggression.  We also investigated the role of a protein that is a candidate for the mER, the GPR30 in both males and females.  At the start of this study, the role of GPR30 in social behaviors was poorly understood and interactions between GPR30 and ERa were speculated but not known.\n\n \n\nOur main scientific findings are:\n\na)    ERa is present on the cell membrane of hypothalamic cells.\n\nb)    Non-genomic actions did increase transcription via the phosphorylation of the ERa, showing that non-genomic signaling is not a disparate signaling pathway from transcription.\n\nc)    Rapid, non-genomic actions of estrogens can increase aggression by male mice towards intruders, possibly without transcription.  We showed uniquely that blocking estrogens in males decreases both basal and stress-induced corticosterone.  Corticosterone is a steroid hormone that is required for stress responses.\n\nd)    Activation of the GPR30 receptor leads rapidly to the phosphorylation of the ERa in the ventral hippocampus of male mice but not in female mice.  This is the first time that such an interaction between these two receptors has been demonstrated.\n\ne)     Activation of the GPR30 regulates anxiety differently between males and females, depending on the duration of activation of this receptor.  Rapid activation decreases anxiety in males but does not affect females while activation over long time frames decreases anxiety in females but not in males. \n\nf)     Activation of GPR30 can increase spines in neurons via a kinase-dependent (ERK) pathway.\n\n \n\nIn a related finding that extends our work on estrogen-corticosterone interaction, which appears to be important to aggression, we also show that a) movement of the glucocorticoid receptor that binds corticosteroids to the nucleus is because of signals from the plasma membrane and b) corticosterone administration can increase estrogen production from neurons, presumably via transcription. \n\nOur findings suggest that a) one function of non-genomic signaling might be to regulate transcription b) that male brains may be more dependent on non-genomic signaling than female brains and c) GPR30 activation increases spines and could increase some aspects of aggression.  Future work is aimed at understanding how non-genomic signaling by estrogens can rapidly induce social behaviours in males, including the production of estrogens in the brain itself and the interaction with corticosterone.  This could have implications for drugs that target either estrogen or glucocorticoid signaling. \n\nFurthermore, our public engagement efforts to foster scientific thinking amongst h..."
