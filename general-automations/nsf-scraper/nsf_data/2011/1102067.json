 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to define a hierarchical integration architecture that allows all\r\nthe heterogeneous components required for electrical and optical interface with neurons can be\r\ndirectly integrated on a micromachined probe substrate with a low-rise profile for high-density\r\nstudies of neural networks in behaving animals. The implemented microsystem aims to be a\r\ngeneric platform technology for scalable, adaptable and reconfigurable hybrid integration.\r\nThe intellectual merit is in a number of important areas, including the formation of highdensity\r\ninterconnects to hybrid electronic chips, hermetic encapsulation of these chips on\r\nmicromachined platforms, the use of magnetically-aligned anisotropic conductive adhesives for\r\nhigh-density lead transfers, the monolithic integration of highly-flexible parylene cables into\r\nprobes formed using completely dry-etched process flows, and the development of hermetic,\r\nlow-profile packages that are compatible with both the cables and the hybrid circuitry.\r\nThe broader impacts are in realizing tools to permit revolutionary progress in our\r\nunderstanding of neural circuits and systems. The work will also provide a platform for realizing\r\nimproved prostheses designed to overcome disorders such as severe epilepsy, Parkinson?s\r\ndisease, and, perhaps, paralysis. Though important these breakthroughs in health care will be, the\r\nimpact of the work should be much broader, especially in combining MEMS-based sensors with\r\nembedded computing and wireless connectivity, as the next major frontier in microelectronics,\r\ncoupling it to the non-electronic world.",
