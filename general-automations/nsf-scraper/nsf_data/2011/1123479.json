The summer school is a two-week event that brings together top international researchers and students to engage in lectures and discussions on leading-edge foundational topics in programming languages and software verification, much of which is not yet in textbooks.   The NSF support ensures participation of US students while paying attention to underrepresented groups.  The summer school will help build the next generation of researchers and a global workforce with expertise in these important areas of research and education.  100 students have registered for the 2011 summer school. The organizers will make video of lectures and other educational materials available to the public immediately after the event.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Oregon Progamming Languages Summer School has been the premier summer school\nfor graduate students involved in programming Language research and new graduate\nstudents exploring the feasibility of starting programming language research.  The\nsummer school is presented as four 90-minute lectures per day for two weeks.  The first few\ndays cover logical foundations of programming languages and are approachable by\nstudents with a standard undergraduate degree in Computer Science.  The program builds on\nthis introduction to discuss leading edge results in the final lectures.  In addition to the\nformal program, the summer school seeks to build a world-wide community of students and\nresearchers who will collaborate in the future.  To this end, the summer school\nalso provides a venue for the students to share their research interests and\ntheir results in a series of short talks.\n\nAttendance at the summer shool has approached one humdred students the last few years.\nHalf of the students attending this year's summer school were from US universities.\nThe remaining half represented 18 countries on four continents.  The majority\nof the attendees were graduate students, with six attendess from software\ncompanies, three undergraduates, four professors and seven post-doctorate researchers.\n\n\nThe theme of the summer school centers around understanding the\ndeep connections between mathematical\nstructures, type theory and logic.  The goal is to create a foundation\nfor program development and for reasoning about programs. This is\nof foremost importance due to the  fact that computers are present\nin many aspects of our daily life, from driving a car to performing\nan online banking or commercial transaction.  The need to establish the\nsecurity and correctness of application programs has never been greater.\nThe summer school considers recent advances in programming languages that\naim to address this need.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/10/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zena M Ariola"
