 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the research team will study how members of a meaningful social unit in construction develop an informal and shared understanding of the extent to which absence is acceptable, tolerable, and legitimate (i.e., absence culture), and consequently, how this affects workers' absence behavior. Studies attempting to understand and solve the issues of absence behavior in the workplace traditionally have focused on individual causes of absence. However, these attempts to identify and remove individual causes have received only modest empirical support. Instead, the view that absence emerges from an individual's social or cultural environment (the absence culture) has become increasingly popular. We aim to study how such relationships can be seen in situations like construction where workers move from jobsite to jobsite. In addition, we will study how absence culture rooted in primary workgroups affect individual decisions related to absence in these situations. The specific objectives of this research are: 1) to identify the feedback processes between individual absence behavior and absence culture, focusing on how the social context affects individual behavior and how a culture forms on construction jobsites; 2) to apply computer simulation techniques to study complex and multi-determined job behaviors like absenteeism; and 3) to incorporate the impact absenteeism-related policies have on both absenteeism levels and construction performance into the boundary of the modeling scope, so that diverse policies can be simulated and tested prior to execution.\r\n \r\nIn terms of broader impacts, the study will provide practical insights into absence-control policies thatcan foster positive work cultures and promote employee attendance. Employee absenteeism is a costly problem in the U.S. construction industry, so it is hoped the results can matter to competitiveness. Positive work cultures can also lead to the achievement of a significant increase in the productivity, quality, and safety of construction work. The findings of this research can also be applied to the study of other work outcomes, such as performance, citizenship, lateness, and turnover.",

However, formal controls have repeatedly been proven ineffective at eliciting desired changes in improving workers attendance motivation. As a result, recent research efforts in management have investigated the role of social controls such as social norms and absence culture on workers&rsquo; absence behavior.

There is a lack of understanding of the impact of social influence on workers&rsquo; absence behavior in a temporary organization such as a construction project where many workers are hired for the specific project and dismissed at its completion.

A total of 334 workers participated in this study. The results of empirical data analyses provided empirical evidence proving that social influence had a major effect on absence behaviors even in a temporary organization. Workers who perceive strict and salient social norms regarding absence behavior are less likely to be absent from the job site. Based on these empirical findings and on theoretical foundations from the literature, we developed two different computational simulation models (i.e., an agent-based model (ABM) and a system dynamics (SD) model) as well as their integration (i.e., a hybrid ABM-SD) to understand dynamic social influence process and to develop policy/intervention guidance to help prevent excessive absenteeism in construction projects. The simulation results showed that self-regulation, social adaptation, and formal rule awareness are three main forces in the dynamics of workers&rsquo; absence behaviors. The dynamics of absence behavior can be seen as a result of interactive feedback systems of these three forces. We found that social adaptation is the primary contributor to the evolution of social norms both in a negative and positive way, and strictness of self-regulation is key to the development of a favorable social norm by controlling negative influence of others&rsquo; behaviors. In addition, policy implication indicated that promoting in workers&rsquo; an ethos of strict self-regulation can maximize positive social influences on worker attendance, which can be achieved by strengthening workers&rsquo; commitment to the job or increasing their perception of higher level project goals.
