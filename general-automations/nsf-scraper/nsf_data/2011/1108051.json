The program was an overwhelming success and has allowed me to achieve both of those goals fully.\n\nThrough the program I have gained an immense appreciation for both Korea and it's people.  The country's astonishing beauty parallels the complex nuances of it's culture and helped to make an amazing imersive experience.  Living and working in Korea for over 10 weeks has allowed me to really experience it, wheras simply visiting would note have allowed me to really appreciate all that it has to offer.  \n\nI worked in the Smart Materials Research Lab with Dr. Woong-Ryeol Yu and his graduate students.  The project aimed to improve understanding of smart materials through solving the complicated equations that are involved using computer simulations.  The project was a great success -- I learned so much from the expertise of Dr. Yu and his students, who had been working in that field for much longer than I had.  \n\nHowever, the learning did not end with the simulation.  I learned not only how to operate, but how to enjoy operating in the Korean laboratory setting.
