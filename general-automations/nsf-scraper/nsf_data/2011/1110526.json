 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study investigates the evolutionary forces acting on a potent oncogene and putative speciation gene in the Southern Platyfish, Xiphophorus maculatus.  The Xmrk gene in X. maculatus causes the formation of aggressive melanomas in hybrids between X. maculatus and a closely related species, Xiphophorus helleri.  As a result, this has been a classic system for both skin cancer and speciation research.  However, relatively little is known about the evolutionary genetics of Xmrk.  This research will use sophisticated molecular techniques and mathematical models to estimate the strengths and types of evolutionary forces acting on Xmrk.  Specifically, this research will determine whether genetic evidence exists for reproductive isolation between X. maculatus and X. helleri caused by Xmrk and the strength of selection operating on Xmrk. \r\n\r\n\tThis study will advance our understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on cancer genes.   It will also provide much needed data on the molecular basis of reproductive isolation in natural populations.  The molecular, mathematical, and computational techniques developed for this project will advance the capabilities of future research in these areas.  This research is a collaborative effort between scientists at the University of Texas at Austin and at Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del Noroeste in La Paz Mexico.  International collaboration is a critical component of modern research and developing strong bonds between universities in Mexico and the United States greatly advances the science in both countries.",
