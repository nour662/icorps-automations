 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will build and operate a proof-of-concept unit of a thermally activated heat pump with a higher efficiency than the commercial LiBr absorption chiller. Such heat pumps, which can be used for both cooling and heating, are cheaper to build, easier to operate, has a smaller footprint, and are expected to last longer than the commercial LiBr chillers. They can be driven by low level heat from low cost solar collectors. The materials in the system are basically non-toxic. Currently, commercialization of the less efficient and more costly aqua-ammonia absorption heat pump for heating is being considered by DOE although such systems are not suitable for using heat as low as 70o C. \r\n\t\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are reducing the fuel consumption for heating by more than 45% from the conventional furnaces, enabling utilization of heat from low cost solar collectors, engine cooling-water, or other low level heat as low as 70o C for air conditioning and/or heating with greater than 100% ?thermal efficiency?. Wide use of this technology can potentially save 5-10% of the energy used in this country and greatly reduce the summer electricity demand peaks.",
