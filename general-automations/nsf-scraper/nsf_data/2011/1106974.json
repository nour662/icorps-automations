Recent events in climate science have highlighted the need for increased participation of statisticians. While mathematics plays an important role in modeling fluid dynamics, statistics specializes in quantifying uncertainty.  The objective of this project is to build a network of statisticians with interest in atmospheric and ocean science. The hubs of the network (and some nodes) have personnel both in statistics and in atmospheric and ocean science; the National Center for Atmospheric Research is a common node connected to each of the nodes. The network will also connect with similar networks in the Pacific Northwest and in Europe, and will provide the research necessary for decision makers to make informed decisions, based on accurate assessment of uncertainty. Scientifically, the exchanges between the nodes of the network will help foster a cadre of young researchers, including both undergraduate and graduate students, able to work across disciplines, developing relevant methodologies and applying them to important scientific problems. Students at early stages in their careers will get effectively integrated in the statistical and scientific community. This will help them to build a network in the community of statisticians working on multidisciplinary problems.\r\n \r\nThe research topics of this project cover broad areas, with a common theme being multivariate nonstationary non-Gaussian spatio-temporal models, which are needed to describe a changing world. Network researchers will study extreme events in space and time, will develop methods to compare models to data, will make uncertainty assessments for scenario-based climate projections, and will produce computationally efficient ways to deal with large amounts of data from observations and numerical models. The particular combination of research and teaching carried out by the network will ensure that the knowledge generated by the group will immediately be transmitted to graduate students.\r\n\r\nSTATMOS Research Network home page:  http://www.nrcse.washington.edu/statmos/",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe University of Chicago hub, in concert with the other two STATMOS (ResearchNetwork for Statistical Methods for the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences) hubs, supported a broad range of researchers in statistics and environmental sciences undertaking fundamental research in statistics for processes in space and time and their application to problems in the atmospheric and oceanic sciences.  A small selection of projects includes: statistical models for space-time processes on a global scale and their application to geographic patterns in annual averages of temperature; methods for approximating complex computer models with simple empirical models when both the inputs and outputs of the model are variables changing in time; computational methods for working with large environmental datasets exhibiting complex dependencies in space and time; estimating subsurface ocean characteristics based on Argo float data, an international program for measuring ocean temperature and salinity with a network of nearly 4000 free-floating instruments; simulating future climates by intelligently combining observational observations with information on how climate will change obtained from computer models;   developing a range of methods for the statistical analysis of climate extremes, mainly for daily temperature, using both observations and computer model output; and, developing an approach for classifying all precipitation into individual events that provides new ways to quantify precipitation patterns in space and time and how they may be changing.  \n\nThe work of the Chicago hub has had and will continue to have a number of broader impacts beyond the research done.  In particular, the hub provided partial support for eight postdoctoral researchers who have gone on to take positions at a range of academic institutions and private companies.  These postdocs received mentoring from multiple individuals, usually from researchers in both statistics and environmental science, and thus had the opportunity to develop skills for working in interdisciplinary environments that will help them throughout their careers.  Four of these postdocs were jointly mentored by Michael Stein, a statistician, and Elisabeth Moyer, a geophysical scientist, participating in a range of activities to broaden their intellectual horizons and their ability to communicate outside of their areas of specialization.  To give one example of an interdisciplinary collaboration that continues to pay dividends, the work on Argo float data has initiated an ongoing working group of statisticians and oceanographers that is bringing modern methods in statistics for space-time processes to the oceanographic community.  The Chicago hub organized and supported a substantial number of workshops over the years, including, to give a very partial list, events designed to initiate lasting interdisciplinary collaborations, workshops on specific topics such as statistics of extremes, methods for combining numerical models and observations for effective forecasting, and computational methods for large spatial datasets.  The Chicago hub worked closely with other NSF-funded entities such as the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO, The Center for Robust Decision Making on Climate and Energy Policy in Chicago, and the The Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute in Research Triangle Park, NC, amplifying the effectiveness of each organization through joint sponsorship of events and joint support and mentoring for postdocs and graduate students.  The development and application of novel statistical methods to the atmospheric and oceanic sciences may help to inform broader policy debates that depend on having reliable estimates of changes in climate and the uncertainties in these estimates.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/07/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael L Stein"
