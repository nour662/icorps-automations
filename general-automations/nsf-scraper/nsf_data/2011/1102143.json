 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nNanopore membranes have become indispensible tools for filtration. However, these membranes have several drawbacks. To accomplish molecular separation, the nanopores have to be of the same size as the molecules. If mechanical stability is to be maintained, such small nanopores will be very long, significantly slowing down molecular transport. Nanopores patterned using electron or ion beam lithography in silicon dioxide or silicon nitride membranes have the benefit of having a well-controlled size and can be controlled in thickness, however they are costly to manufacture. Biomineralized structures, such as silica diatom shells, offer an alternative approach towards nanopore membranes. Some species exhibit a narrow size distribution of nanopores on the order of 40 nm while they can grow up to 200 \u00b5m in diameter. Diatom shells have a hierarchical pore structure, stabilizing the nanopore membrane with two sets of larger pores. Since they consist of silica, they are optically transparent and can be functionalized using silane chemistry.  In the proposed project the possibility of using the silica diatom shells as nanomembranes in microdevices will be explored. Using chemical pre-patterning of silicon dioxide surfaces the diatom shells will be aligned to pre-defined structures on a wafer scale, allowing to combine bottom-up and top-down device architectures. By chemically functionalizing the silica nanopore surface, for example using Atomic Layer Deposition, the molecular transport properties through the nanopores can be tailored, allowing molecular separation studies. Furthermore, the pores themselves can act as support structures for so-called nano-Bilayer Lipid Membranes, which show an increase in lifetime by a factor of 30 on top-down silicon nitride nanopores.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe research will have a tremendous impact in the field of nanofluidic devices, eventually replacing the track-etched nanopore membranes that are currently used for filtration. Since the pore sizes are small and the pore length is short without compromising the mechanical stability, faster diffusion of molecules is expected. The expected lifetime improvement of nano-Bilayer Lipid Membranes will have a transformational impact on the field ion channel reconstitution.   The interdisciplinary program targets to recruit and retain highly talented students as well as underrepresented and minority students. Graduate students will be educated to become future engineers by preparing them for the challenges that lie ahead by involving them in the proposed research activities. Undergraduate students will be engaged via the Undergraduate Research Initiative scholarship program that has been established at ASU. In collaboration with the Down-to-Earth Science (DES), an NSF-funded GK-12 track II project at Arizona State University, the proposed project will offer a novel educational opportunity for faculty and graduate students to share their research results with the K-12 community, providing a new thrust through the integration of cutting edge research in nanotechnology into the secondary school curriculum.  The research component will be linked with an assessment plan, enabling feedback on the effectiveness of the educational impact, enabling an improvement of the initial teaching concepts.",

When imaging the structure with an electron microscope, one finds a multi-tiered structure of pores with the smallest pores being about 45 nm in diameter, close to the dimensions that are common in microelectronic device manufacturing. While the structures are pretty to look at, we asked if after removal of the organic layer, the nano-porous structures that the diatoms synthesize can be combined with silicon chips to provide new functionality to microfluidic devices. In the project, we were able to successfully demonstrate that we could place such a diatom shell, called frustule, on top of a pre-fabricated microfluidic access hole that has been etched all the way through the wafer. We also investigated how this placement can be automated, using photo-patterning of areas that are water repellant (hydrophobic), causing the solution carrying the nanopore disks to retract to the remaining hydrophilic spots. However, once deposited, the nanopore disks need to adhere to the surface and must not allow fluid to leak around the edges. One of our main accomplishments is the development of a process which seals the perimeter of the biomineralized nanopore layer using an organic, UV-curable epoxy compound, making sure that the nanopores do not clog. Using this assembly, we were able to show that colored dye molecules diffuse through the nanopore layer and the microfluidic channel. Since the movement of molecules and particles through the nanopores depends on whatever coating is present on the nanopore surface, one of our major findings is that pristine diatoms right after cleaning of the organic layer are completely hydrophilic with no carbon residues present at the surface. They readily fill with water and let molecules pass. However, they can easily be coated with hydrocarbon molecules, rendering them hydrophobic and thereby preventing water to wet the surface. By carefully controlling the amount of hydrocarbons at the surface the nanopores can still be filled with water, while also allowing artificial cell membranes to be formed across the nanopores. These nano-bilayer lipid membranes can host ion channels, which themselves can sense chemicals. This sensing action can be monitored via the electrical current passing through the ion channels and the nanopores when the membranes are inserted in a fluidic bath with an electrode on either side of the nanopore membrane. Nano-bilayer lipid membranes are technologically interesting since they do not suffer from a catastrophic breakdown compared to single, micron-diameter membranes. The diatom nanopore disks can also be used for the culturing of cells, providing an ideal environment for the study of for example cancer cells, since nutrients can permeate through the nanopores to reach the cell from the bottom. However, the nanopore membranes can be used for more than microfluidic applications. They can be used as shadow masks for the deposition of metal nanopillars, which are very useful for fluorescence microscopy of cells. We also showed that an optical fiber can be coupled to a biomineralized nanopore layer that has been placed on a silicon chip, employing the unique optical properties of the structure based on the particular nanopore size and spacing to guide a particular spectrum of light on the chip.
