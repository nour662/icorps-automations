 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing needed-based scholarships to qualified students participating in an innovative partnership between Norfolk State University Engineering faculty and peer faculty at five community college campuses. The project extends the conventional focus of college transfer programs beyond the baccalaureate to the graduate level.  The project includes comprehensive enrichment activities to cultivate social and intellectual connections between participating students and faculty across six college campuses. These activities include a bridge immersion program, peer mentoring and tutorial services, weekend recruiting events, and a televideo seminar series. The project increases the number of talented students, including female and minority students, in the targeted Electronics and Optical Engineering program. Assessments are being conducted to identify and document factors that influence student success and partnership strength.",
