 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thermal fluctuations in non-equilibrium systems exhibit remarkable\r\nbehavior compared to equilibrium systems. Giant fluctuations in\r\nbinary mixtures of miscible fluids have been observed, including\r\nin recent experiments in microgravity. Novel mathematical and\r\ncomputational challenges need to be addressed in order to include\r\nthermal fluctuations in traditional computational fluid dynamics in\r\na way that is consistent with statistical mechanics. This proposal\r\nis concerned with the design, mathematical analysis, and computer\r\nimplementation of finite-volume methods for fluctuating hydrodynamics\r\nof fluid mixtures, as well as applications to diffusively mixing\r\nfluids in gravity. The following research directions are proposed:\r\n(1) Multi-resolution numerical schemes for solving the compressible\r\nstochastic continuum equations; (2) Algorithms for incompressible,\r\nand (3) low Mach fluctuating hydrodynamics of miscible mixtures on\r\nstaggered and collocated grids; (4) Simulations of giant fluctuations\r\nand comparisons to experiments; (5) Study of the contribution\r\nof advection by velocity fluctuations to transport in finite\r\nnon-equilibrium systems.\r\n\r\nFlows at micro and nano scales typical of new devices and biological\r\nsystems are affected by thermal fluctuations. These effects are often\r\nassumed small and are not included in traditional computational\r\nfluid dynamics. However, giant fluctuations in the concentration\r\nof a polymer solution have been observed in recent experiments\r\nconducted in microgravity on a research space shuttle. Computer\r\nsimulations are ideally suited for studying the details of this\r\nphenomenon and comparing the predictions of existing theory to\r\nthe experimental findings. However, our community still lacks\r\nthe appropriate computational tools, including both algorithms and\r\nlarge-scale parallel codes, to attack this problem. The investigator\r\nand his colleagues will develop such tools and use them to answer\r\nimportant scientific questions concerning fluctuations in fluids, in\r\nclose collaboration with experimentalists. The developed algorithms\r\nwill be implemented in a public domain code whose development is funded\r\nthrough a Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation NSF grant.",
