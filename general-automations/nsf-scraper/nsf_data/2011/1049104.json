 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a team of researchers in a major research thrust in decadal climate prediction entitled \"Investigating Decadal Climate Predictability and Climate Impacts (IDCPI) on the Western US.\"  The IDCPI is an interdisciplinary effort to use instrumental records of climate and paleoclimate data to assess the skill level of Earth System Models (EaSM) to forecast decadal climate variability. \r\n\r\nGenerally, the research team will focus on the region of the western Unites States because both historic and prehistoric records document recurrent decadal-scale hydroclimate variability, including repeated drought, which has been attributed to Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the team will use models, in combination with an isotope \"fingerprinting\" methodology, to: 1) assess the ability of Earth System models (global and regional models) to accurately simulate the atmospheric response to SST forcing; 2) retrospectively investigate whether models can predict drought in advance and estimate how long the events will persist; 3) assess whether a future drought in the western U.S. is currently predictable with existing models; and 4) develop future hydrologic predictions with uncertainty estimates for the western U.S. where models exhibit skill.\r\n\r\nThis project has the potential to improve the reliability of regional climate predictions in the southwest Unites States.  In doing so, the research would be of importance to resource managers and policy makers.  The project also provides a unique cohort approach to the training and mentoring of post doctoral scholars associated with the collaborating institutions.",
