 "awd_abstract_narration": "The March 11, 2011 earthquake and resulting tsunami made substantial damage to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, and as a consequence there were significant releases of iodine, cesium, cobalt and other radioisotopes to the environment. Radionuclides were released to the atmosphere as well as the ocean. For atmospheric releases it was only a matter of days before they dispersed in the northern hemisphere. Isotopes detected on EPA air filters at many US sites included 137Cs, 134Cs, 132Te, 132I and 131I. While the currently observed radiation levels do not pose a health risk for the US population the released activities are easily identified over the long-term background levels in the atmosphere. Releases so far have been episodic and highly variable, making predictions of spreading and deposition patterns difficult. \r\n\r\nWith funding from this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID), researchers at the University of Hawaii at Manoa will monitor seawater near Hawaii in the central Pacific Ocean in order to establish a dataset of selected key isotopes. Its proximity to Japan makes Hawaii an obvious, important monitoring point. They will collect coastal and offshore water samples as well as particulates from ocean traps. Additionally, they will analyze samples provided to us by investigators from Midway and Guam. This dataset would become a part of a global effort initiated by colleagues at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to establish an east to west network of sampling stations in the Pacific an Atlantic Oceans. Since releases from Japan have been registered in Hawaii as early as March 22, it is essential that sampling and analysis begin immediately in a coordinated and quality controlled manner. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   The findings of this study will be incorporated into the database of results collected in the Pacific as well as the Atlantic Oceans to build the understanding of the inventories and behavior of fission-produced radionuclides in the marine environment on a global scale.  The study will include international collaboration with investigators from Japan, the IAEA, Czech Republic and scientists from WHOI, USGS, Guam and others.",
