 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports Justin Sambur of Cornell University as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.  Dr. Sambur will work on studying the catalytic activity of single nanoparticles using a variety of microscopy methods.  The PI will collaborate with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory.  The ultimate goal of this research is to develop efficient, photoelectrolytic cells for solar water splitting.  For his plan for broadening participation, Dr. Sambur will engage high-school students and teachers in solar energy research using the SHArK (Solar Hydrogen Activity Research Kit) project.  \r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. Sambur is aimed at developing improved photoelectrochemical cells for solar water splitting - to enable the generation of chemical fuel from water and sunlight.   The results of research like this can help society come up with energy alternatives to fossil fuels.  The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Sambur are aimed at giving young scientists and the public exposure to the potential for positive societal impact from the results of basic chemical research.",
