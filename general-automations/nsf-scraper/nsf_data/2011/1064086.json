Snow, VT on July 24-29, 2011, and will be convened under the auspices of the Gordon Research Conferences.  The conference will bring together a large and diverse group of scientists from the atmospheric chemistry community and related fields to discuss new developments in chemical observations, mechanisms and models; the formation, composition and impacts of aerosols; biomass burning; and the role of atmospheric chemistry in climate change.  Researchers at the frontiers of atmospheric chemistry will meet in an informal setting and exchange ideas and new information at the forefront of this field.  Broader impacts stem from the societal importance of atmospheric chemistry to air quality, public health, and climate change, and also from the participation of at least 25 early-career scientists whose attendance costs will be partially offset with funds from this award.",
