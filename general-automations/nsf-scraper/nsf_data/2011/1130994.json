 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workforce capable of interacting across national borders is critical, not only to the future health of our economy, but also to continued innovation and leadership in science and technology. NBIC/MINATEC Student Exchange for Research on Nano/Biotechnology will develop a cadre of young scientists with the skills and experience to engage globally in science and engineering research and to do so in the context of a synergistic research platform. The program is a two-way student exchange and research collaboration between the Nano/Bio Interface Center at the University of Pennsylvania (NBIC) and the Micro- and Nanotechnologies Innovation Campus in Grenoble, France (MINATEC). Nanobiotechnology is an inherently multidisciplinary field that addresses fundamental concepts and technological applications of some of the most critical issues of our time. These range from biomedical sensors and targeted drug delivery, to energy harvesting and energy efficiency, to monitoring and remediation of air and water quality. Educating students in the fundamental principles of nanobiotechnology prepares them to contribute across boundaries in these evolving fields. A partnership with Alabama State University will extend these opportunities to its diverse student population.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe intellectual merit of this program is based on the increased understanding of fundamental issues that will result from the research. Specifically, the electron transport mechanisms in new DNA hybrid nanostructures, the effect of surfaces on cell and protein interactions, and the behavior of biological colloids in fluidic environments. The ability to understand and control these processes will enable new strategies for biomolecular electronics, biosensors, and medical therapeutics.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe broader impacts of this program are several fold. A new population of students will be trained in the cross-disciplinary field of nano biotechnology. These students will have developed the additional skills necessary to interact effectively in a multi-cultural global environment. Furthermore, the recruitment strategy and partnerships will lead to a diverse student group with the skills to take leadership positions in a variety of career paths.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and the NSF Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Office of the Assistant Director (OAD), and the Engineering and Education Centers (EEC).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe International Student Exchange for Research on Nano/Biotechnology enabled 29 undergraduate and graduate students to participate in summer research in labs at the Grenoble Innovation for Advanced Technologies (GIANT) campus in Grenoble, France during the summers of 2011-2016.  These University of Pennsylvania and Alabama State University students worked on research projects in a diversity of science and engineering disciplines, in French organizations that ranged from academic labs to European science and research facilities to startup companies.  At GIANT, the students participated in a well-structured, 10-week internship program that included other international interns. \n\nThis grant has provided the resources for undergraduate and graduate students to experience conducting research in a different country and to develop competencies that should make them more competitive in the global science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) marketplace.  Surveys of alumni of the program indicate that among all of the participants (N=29; 2011 (pilot year), 2012-2016), the vast majority remain in the STEM-related academic pipeline or industry STEM jobs.  Exceptions (N=4) are: job unknown/on job market at last contact, management consultant, MD student, and job information not shared (borderline classified/did not want to identify).\n\nThe impact on society is the promotion of international and cultural goodwill and understanding.  The students sent through this grant serve in a sense as ambassadors of the United States for all of the French and International people they interacted with on a daily basis at work or in their daily lives.  The Americans who participate in the program typically return with a much broader sense of appreciation of the diversity of thoughts, culture and society that exist beyond the U.S. and have been challenged to develop skills for dealing with the unfamiliar and/or different solutions to familiar problems.  These are skills that should contribute to a better functioning of our domestic society which is quickly changing, highly diverse and increasingly affected by multi-national issues.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan T Johnson"
