 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global Harmonic Analysis\r\nNSF/CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences\r\nUniversity of Kentucky, June 20-24, 2011\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal harmonic analysis may be viewed as an extension of classical\r\nFourier theory on the line and on the circle to the geometric setting of\r\nRiemannian manifolds. Riemannian manifolds provide models of both com-\r\npletely integrable and chaotic dynamical systems, and also provide a setting\r\nin which the connection between \"classical\" and \"quantum\" behavior can be\r\ncarefully studied. Moreover, just as harmonic analysis on the line and the\r\ncircle are a fundamental tool in the study of both linear and nonlinear differ-\r\nential equations in these settings, so global harmonic analysis is fundamental\r\nto the study of di\u00a4erential equations, such as the wave and Schr\u00f6dinger equa-\r\ntion, on manifolds. On a general Riemannian manifold, harmonic analysis is\r\nthe study of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian in the given Riemannian metric.\r\n\r\nGlobal harmonic analysis refers to the use of the global dynamics of geo-\r\ndesic fow on the manifold to study the large-eigenvalue asymptotics of the\r\neigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a manifold. Since global\r\neigenfunctions of the Laplacian on a manifold are eigenfunctions of the wave\r\ngroup, and the wave group propagates singularities along geodesics, the high-\r\nfrequency properties of eigenfunctions are connected to the long-time dy-\r\nnamics of the geodesic flow. Two cases of particular interest are quantum\r\ncomplete integrability, where the underlying geodesic flow is completely in-\r\ntegrable, and quantum chaos, where the underlying geodesic flow is ergodic.\r\n\r\nProfessor Steve Zelditch of Northwestern University will given ten lectures\r\non global harmonic analysis. He will begin with basic examples (constant\r\ncurvature spaces), develop material on pseudodi\u00a4erential and Fourier inte-\r\ngral operators, derive trace formulas including the celebrated Duistermaat-\r\nGuillemin trace formula, and discuss applications to properties of eigenfunc-\r\ntions and eigenvalues and inverse eigenvalue problems. Completely integrable\r\nand ergodic systems will be considered in depth.",
