SECON is a premier conference in the areas of sensor, ad hoc, and mesh networking, serving as a meeting point of researchers from academia and industry, as well as practitioners in diverse fields of wireless communications and networking. This project supports travel to the conference for US based Ph.D. students who might not otherwise be able to attend for financial reasons. Students will be exposed to the conference, a technical forum that is critical for their professional maturity and development. Students will also be involved in various activities and work as volunteers to support these activities, increasing their level of involvement and connection to the conference and the research community. The recipients will be chosen based on an open competition and preference will be given to students from underrepresented groups.",
