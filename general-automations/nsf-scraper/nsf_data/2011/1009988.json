 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our current understanding of continental rifting is largely based on studies of evolved and relict rift systems. Observations from these studies have motivated and constrained numerical models that describe rift evolution from initiation to rupture. However, there are very few field observations that constrain processes occurring at the earliest stages of rifting and the structural controls on these processes. This project involves a project to investigate the question of what happens in the early stages of continental rifting.  The East African Rift System (EARS), because of its proximity to the pole of rotation, exhibits a strong gradient in rift evolution along its length.  This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the processes that drive rift initiation and control early rift localization.  \r\n\r\nThe PIs will undertake a multidisciplinary investigation of the southwest branch of the EARS, which includes the very early stage Okavango Rift Zone, where classic geomorphic rift features are just beginning to emerge, and the Mweru, Luangwa (Zambia) and Malawi Rifts, where geomorphic features are fully developed but magma (if present) has yet to breach the surface.  The PIs will apply a combination of geophysical, geological, geochemical and geodynamic techniques across the southwest branch of the EARS to test the predictions of those hypotheses.  Passive seismic data will constrain lithospheric-scale structure and upper-mantle flow patterns.  Wide angle seismic profiling, along with gravity data, will constrain variations in crustal and uppermost mantle structure.  Magnetotelluric  measurements will provide system-scale constraints on lithospheric thin spots and the presence of melt, while remote sensing and field mapping will be used to map surface deformation. Geochemical analysis of hot spring fluids will identify the presence of mantle-derived melts. Geodynamic modeling will synthesize the new geophysical observations and geochemical results to develop the next generation of continental rifting models.",

In active rifting, lithospheric extension is enhanced by the presence of magmas derived from a hot upwelling asthenosphere. Magma softens the lithosphere, enhancing rifting. In passive rifting, lithospheric extension is the result of far field forces generated by plate motions. Indeed, due to the amount of force required and available it is next to impossible to rupture the lithosphere by only mechanical stretching of the lithosphere. This poses a significant challenge in our understanding of rift initiation because there are numerous examples of rift systems worldwide where rifting is not accompanied by magmatism (e.g., The magma poor Western Branch of the East African Rift System) questioning the necessity for magma as a requirement for rifting. To date, most research on rift systems have targeted magma (rich) assisted rifts. Almost no research has focused on understanding the processes that initiate and control the earliest stages of magma poor rifts. Our study addressed this knowledge gap by targeting several magma poor rifts. Our objectives were to: (1) constrain the upper mantle and crustal structure beneath rifts, (2) use the chemistry of hot springs as a &ldquo;sniffer&rdquo; of near surface magmatic activity, and (3) conduct geomorphologic and kinematic studies to understand fault evolution during rifting. We targeted the Okavango Rift Zone, Botswana (where extension has barely commenced and classic geomorphic rift features are absent) and the Malawi, Albertine-Rhino (Uganda) and Luangwa (Zambia) rifts where although exhibiting fully developed geomorphic rift characteristics, surface magmatism if present has yet to reach the surface.</p>\n<p>Our results from the Okavango suggest that the crust is 4-5 km thinner beneath the rift, is characterized by elevated heat flow, and that an altered mantle lies beneath the rift.
