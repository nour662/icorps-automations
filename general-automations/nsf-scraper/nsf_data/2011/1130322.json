 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this activity is to provide support for five students from U.S. universities to attend the 22nd Annual IEEE/LEOS Workshop on Interconnections within High-Speed Digital Systems and participate in the academic poster session.  The workshop will be held May 8 - May 11, 2011 at the Eldorado Hotel & Spa in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  The workshop agenda includes tutorials, invited talks, interactive problem solving sessions, and an academic poster session.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The exponential growth in data traffic and ever increasing demand for high bit-rate communications and e-services has accelerated research and development in the area of interconnection technology. The paradigm shift in computing towards parallel multicore processing requires an integrated design approach to address interconnect bottlenecks from chip-scale to system-scale architectures in networking, communications, and high performance computing. This workshop addresses the multi-disciplinary nature of these interconnection challenges by bringing together key researchers and industry experts from a variety of fields, including semiconductor devices, computing architectures and algorithms, 3D packaging, and opto-electronic integration. An academic poster session includes contributions from a selected number of high quality student papers.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This workshop will have significant impact on high-speed interconnection technology discussing novel approaches to break bandwidth bottlenecks in computing networks and communication systems. Junior researchers from the U.S., including graduate students and post-docs, will benefit from the interdisciplinary and interactive workshop format, training them to provide the next generation of high performance interconnection solutions. The workshop includes a strong outreach component through interactions with academic organizations and minority-serving institutions.",

Aside from the regular invited talks that comprise the presentation part of the workshop, two afternoons are set aside for problem solving sessions, in which the whole workshop community is given one tough application problem and task groups are formed that brainstorm about different aspects of the problem. The Workshop culminates with a final set of presentations from all sub-groups, proposing a complete system solution.\n\nThis is a great format not only to bring electrical and optical interconnect people together to brainstorm and understand the language and solutions that each side can offer, but also for junior parti..."
