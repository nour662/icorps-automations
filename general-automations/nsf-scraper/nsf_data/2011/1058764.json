 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Richard Cole and his group at the University of New Orleans seek to investigate ways to improve electrospray (ES) mass spectrometry by building upon previous innovations in the development of anion attachment electrospray mass spectrometry; by detailed mapping of current and potential distributions within the ES emitter; and by optimization of detection of weakly-associated complexes in biological solutions.  Efforts include development of \"regioselective\" anion attachment for selective detection of specific binding sites. This research will provide a means to improve the ability to detect and identify compounds such as steroids. A related aim is to improve the understanding of binding like that between tannins in food and proteins in saliva; this may provide a new means to gauge the loss in antioxidant capacity of potential tannin food additives. Derivation of a mathematical model to describe electrical current and potential within the electrospray device will advance the fundamental understanding of electrochemical processes in electrospray.\r\n\r\nThe project expands an existing partnership between the University of New Orleans and Xavier University of Louisiana. This endeavor will thus enlarge and enrich opportunities for graduate students and undergraduates (including members of underrepresented groups) at both institutions, specifically by widening exposure to mass spectrometry.",
