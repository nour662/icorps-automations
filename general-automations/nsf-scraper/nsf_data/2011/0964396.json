 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to use global far-ultraviolet (FUV) images Earth's auroral regions and polar caps to address several questions concerning the occurrence of ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves in the Pc5 frequency range (2 - 7 mHz).  Compared to the traditional ground-based Pc5-detecting techniques such as  magnetometers and HF radars, the global auroral images have much better spatial coverage and/or resolution, and are not subject to the ionospheric screening effect of the higher-m ULF waves in terms of magnetic disturbances.  The first question to be considered is how often quasi-periodic pressure variations in the solar wind excite Pc5 waves. A related question is whether or not Pc5 ULF waves occur preferentially for high solar wind speed. The project will also address the question of the relative significance of solar wind pressure pulses versus magnetic flux transfer events in generating Pc5 pulsations.  These questions will be addressed by analyzing auroral images acquired by Polar UVI, along with other in situ magnetic field measurements from spacecraft (Polar, Geotail, Interball-1, Cluster, and THEMIS), using a spectral analysis technique known as the S-Transform.  The S-Transform makes it possible to extract the global Pc5 ULF wave features. The project will determine if the magnetosphere responds to quasi-periodic solar wind pressure variations as a breathing mode or as a cavity/waveguide mode by determining whether or not the ULF waves are directly driven and propagate antisunward.  It will distinguish between Kelvin-Helmholtz driven and pressure pulse driven events by determining whether they are associated with solar wind features or tend to occur during high speed streams, it will distinguish between Pc5 events associated with magnetic flux transfer events and pressure pulse driven events by checking if the wave motion depends on the magnetosheath flow speed and IMF orientation\r\n\r\nUltralow-Frequency (ULF) waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere have been studied in a wide variety of contexts for a very long time. They constitute an important diagnosis of the ways the magnetosphere responds to external disturbances. A great volume of literature has resulted from such studies. Yet, the region of applicability of the current theoretical models are still uncertain. This is in large measure due to the lack of knowledge on the global characteristics of Pc5 ULF waves. This knowledge is hard to obtain using traditional techniques. Waves in the Pc5 frequency range have important effects in the energization of electrons in Earth's radiation belts.  Applications of a new, advanced spectral analysis tool (the S-transform) in 2-D auroral images can be readily generalized to the study of ULF waves of higher frequencies and their cross-scale coupling",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nGeomagnetic pulsations are one of the oldest subjects in geospace physics and are still actively studied. Auroral pulsations are fluctuations in the luminosity of an auroral event. In the Pc 5 frequency range (1.7-6.7 mHz) auroral pulsations are generally considered a subset of the geomagnetic pulsations but their generation processes are little known. This project is a pilot study that promotes the use of global auroral images to explore the global scale of Pc 5 ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves that cannot be measured with other means presently. The key findings from the project include:\n \n\n\nCharacterization \tof single-frequency auroral pulsations in a global scale.\n\n\nAt \tleast some of the characteristics of auroral Pc 5 pulsations are \tconsistent with geomagnetic pulsations observed on the ground.\n\n\nAuroral \tPc 5 pulsations are associated with compressional mode ULF waves.\n\n\nFirst \tobservation of field line resonances, as Pc 5 ULF waves, in the \tmagnetosphere produced by magnetic field dipolarization (substorm \tonset), i.e., changes of the magnetotail from a stretch to a dipole \tconfiguration.\n\n\nFirst \tdirect evidence for the existence of a \"magnetospheric cavity \tmode\" wave (i.e., the entire magnetosphere oscillates inward and \toutward harmonically).\n\n\nSuggesting \tthe existence of a \"magnetospheric flapping mode\" (i.e., the \twindsock effect).\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, this project builds the scientific knowledge base about the Geospace system behavior that in the long-term will result in better space weather prediction. For example, this project's results can help construct the foundation for the long frequency ULF waves that play an important role in the energization of electrons in the Earth's outer radiation belt, a growing interest not only in the space physics community but also in the space weather operation. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kan Liou"
