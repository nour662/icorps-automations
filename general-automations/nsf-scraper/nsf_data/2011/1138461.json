 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northwestern University proposes to develop computational thinking (CT) activities that can be embedded throughout existing high school STEM curricula. The approach casts a wide net, introducing a diverse range of students (including those from traditionally underrepresented groups) to CT skills through STEM courses that they are already taking. The intent is that students understand that computing is more than programming, it is a vital skill set that pervades modern STEM fields. In addition to the embedded CT activities, the project will develop a full-year course that explores the use of computational methods across a range of disciplines including math, physics, chemistry, biology, and earth/environmental science. This project builds on existing partnerships with local schools and teachers and on an NSF GK12 program, Reach for the Stars, that pairs graduate students in CS/STEM disciplines with local middle and high school teachers to develop CT activities based on the graduate students' research. The current proposal will use this rich set of initial CT activities as a starting point for developing 60 refined CT activities that can be embedded in traditional STEM courses. Two summer professional development workshops and ongoing Saturday sessions will be used to train a team of 30 pilot teachers to test the CT activities in their STEM classrooms. These professional development resources will then be revised for larger-scale replication of our CT curriculum. Evaluation studies will document the CT learning and attitudinal gains for both teachers and students and provide initial evidence on the success of our embedded CT approach.",

Further, the students who do study computational topics tend to not reflect the overall student body, with female and minority students being disproportionately underrepresented.\n\nEmerging national science standards recognize the practice of \"using mathematics and computational thinking\" (NGSS Lead States, 2013), which reflects this growing importance of computation and digital technologies across the scientific disciplines.  However, it provides little guidance for teachers who will be required to realize it in their classrooms. Much of the difficulty stems from the fact that the practices collected under the umbrella term \"computational thinking\" have not been clearly defined in terms of their use in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\n\nTo address these challenges, this project first developed a definition of computational thinking for the STEM fields in the form of a taxonomy consisting of four main categories: data practices, modeling and simulations practices, computational problem solving practices, and systems thinking practices.

We developed a library of nearly two-dozen CT activities for high school biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics classes.  We also developed a set of CT assessments that can be used to measure the growth and development of CT skills in students.  Both our materials and assessments are available on the web at http://ct-stem.northwestern.edu to support the broadest possible use by educators and researchers.   The project also developed teacher professional development materials for use in preparing teachers to understand CT and to implement our CT activities in their classrooms.  This project engaged over 60 teachers from 21 schools in and around the Chicago metro area.  Of these, 5 schools participate in our research study.  Over 1000 high school students benefitted from new CT instruction in their classes.  An analysis of those students who participated in our research study indicated that we were successful in broadening participation to a diverse student population that reflected the overall makeup of the participating schools:  Students were 48% female and 52% male; 33% Afr..."
