 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop digital electronics and software with the potential to dramatically improve the measurement performance of lower resolution gamma ray detectors.  Whereas high-purity germanium (HpGe) detectors provide outstanding resolution in a variety of applications, from scientific research to homeland security, their high cost and relatively low count rate limits widespread adoption.  Our objective is to develop a self-optimizing digital spectrometer based on the use of lower-resolution detectors.  In specific applications, this technology will deliver a level of performance that is equivalent to HpGe detectors, but at lower cost and better elemental and compound detectability per unit of scan time.   Phase I will involve the development of algorithms to extract all the information content (i.e. the entire shape function) from the more diffuse spectra provided by the low-resolution detectors. The shape functions include the photopeaks, unresolved photopeaks and Compton scattered gamma rays. These new algorithms will then be tested and evaluated to determine the performance of the system.  Phase II will complete the design and build the digital electronics. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project results from the ability to use lower resolution detectors to deliver performance similar to higher resolution detectors.  This new capability would enable new applications that previously were not viable, or significantly reduce the cost of detection in applications that were prohibitively expensive.  Potential applications include:  (1) lower cost, faster explosive detection equipment; (2) lower cost and better screening of cargo containers; (3) improved Radiation Portal Monitors (RPM) for spectroscopy analysis - lower resolution sodium iodide (or other) detectors could be used to deliver higher performance; (4) improved, lower-cost hand-held radiation detectors.  Because high resolution detectors often are used in these systems, the equipment is very expensive and, in some cases, the data collection rates are slow.  The use of lower cost and faster detectors can significantly improve the cost effectiveness of these systems.  From a commercial standpoint, a number of markets can benefit from this low cost, high performance technology, including markets related to defense, homeland security, and scientific instrumentation.    From a homeland security standpoint, for a given DHS budget, more cargo screening systems could be supplied with advanced cargo scanning equipment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project developed new algorithms with the potential to dramatically improve the performance of Homeland Security screening systems.  Current technology for Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) systems and other airline and cargo security screening systems are inadequate to positively identify unknown materials.  In Phase I, we developed and proved feasibility of the core algorithms that will be the foundation for the SOS.  Under a Phase 1B award - which was funded by a leading NII vendor - we modified the algorithms for detection of nuclear material.  The results of the Phase 1B were reviewed in detail by the NII vendor and their customer.   Both NII vendor and their customer stated that the results were excellent and greatly exceeded expectations. \n\nThe broader impacts of this project result from the enabling capabilities of the XR-SOS platform technology, which can be used in multiple applications.  The resulting XR-SOS can dramatically improve the detection performance of  Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) systems, and nuclear detection systems.  Potential applications of the XR-SOS include: 1) Improved explosive detection equipment; 2) improved capability for screening of cargo containers; and 3) improved detection of covert nuclear weapons.
