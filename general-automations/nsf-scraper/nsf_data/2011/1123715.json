EarthKin\r\nscientists from University of Maine, Penn State, Columbia, and Saint Francis University\r\nwill compile existing reaction rates into a one-stop database that will allow access to\r\nresearchers working on a diverse range of projects ranging from removing carbon\r\ndioxide from the atmosphere and permanently storing it beneath the ground to cleaning\r\nup contaminated environmental sites. When completed EarthKin will be available to\r\nscientists free via the web at www.earthchem.org. Not only will we compile existing\r\ndata, but we will also encourage new researchers to become involved by uploading their\r\nnew results into the database.\r\n\r\nRecent advances in geoinformatics (the subdiscipline of developing technological\r\nand computation tools to facilitate information dissemination in the geosciences) have\r\ndrastically increased access that researchers have to geological information. Many\r\nrecent endeavors have focused on online publishing of large data sets in order to make\r\ndata available to the wider community. EarthKin is especially interesting in that it is one\r\nof the first attempts to include experimental data in a web-based data management\r\nplatform. To do this, we will need to build new tools and data structures that will allow\r\nthe existing EarthChem platform to incorporate a new type of data.",
