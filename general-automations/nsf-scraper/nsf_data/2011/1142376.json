 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:\r\nThe objective is to develop a microfabricated biosensing platform based on Glucose Binding Protein (GBP) that continuously and reliably measures glucose levels in the hypoglycemic, normal, and hyperglycemic range.  The platform will consist of three components: a glucose-sensing array based on the electrochemical detection of glucose using the model enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx), an independent power supply, and a telemetry system.  The performance of this biosensing array will be compared with that of the well-established GOx glucose biosensor.\r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe project has significance beyond blood glucose monitoring, since identical miniaturized biosensing platforms can be utilized for other applications with a wide range of other biosensors.  In addition, multiple sensors selective to a series of analytes can be incorporated in different reservoirs within a single device, allowing the measurement of multiple analytes.  Moreover, this platform can be utilized as a responsive drug delivery system.  Such a system integrates reservoirs loaded with miniature sensors with drug-containing reservoirs.  Finally, the proposed platforms should result in enabling technologies that will find applications in individualized medicine.\r\n \r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe work will involve students at both, the graduate and undergraduate levels.  Such work will foster interdisciplinary interactions and will provide the students with the necessary skills and knowledge for the design and development of novel biotechnologies.  The investigators plan to broadly disseminate the results of this work and raise the awareness of the general public in diabetes research, biosensing, hybrid systems, and device miniaturization.  This will be accomplished through participation in workshops and outreach programs.  The newly developed technologies will be highlighted in bioengineering courses.\r\n",

To that end, we designed and developed new glucose recognition proteins (GRPs) by truncating the full length glucose/galactose binding protein from <em>E. coli</em> glucose galactose binding protein (GBP), and by globally incorporating unnatural amino acids with the structure of GRPs. Three truncated fragments of GBP (tGRP1, tGRP2, and tGRP3) were engineered based on a rational design to maintain the glucose binding ability as well as the ability to undergo conformational change on binding to glucose. The three different proteins were expressed in <em>E. coli</em> and chemically modified via site-selective labeling of a unique Cys residue with a fluorescent probe, namely 7-diethylamino-3-((((2-maleimidyl)ethyl)amino)carbonyl) coumarin (MDCC) to determine the glucose binding ability. Since tGRP3, the smallest truncated fragment of GBP had most of the amino acids removed required to be functional and therefore it lacked any glucose binding activity. However, tGRP1 and tGRP2 were able to respond to changes in glucose which was reflected by the quenching in the fluorescence emission from the MDCC-labeled tGRPs on binding to glucose It was found that as the protein was increasingly truncated, the apparent K<sub>D&shy;</sub> observed was increased, thus decreasing its affinity for glucose. Therefore, truncating GBP allowed for the modulation of the binding constant, which in turn, facilitated the utilization of GBP for the development of glucose biosensor for detection in physiological ranges. Furthermore, the alteration of protein sequence by global incorporation of unnatural amino acids in full length GBP and its truncated fragments (tGRP1 and tGRP2) was investigated as a tool to alter activity and thermal stability of these proteins. Fluorinated tryptophan (5-fluorotryptophan, FW) and leucine (5,5,5-trifluoroleucine, FL) were incorporated in the GRPs using a media-shift method wherein the bacteria is first grown in a medium enriched with all 20 amino acids, and then transferred to a medium lacking the 20<sup>th</sup> amino acid, which is then replaced by its unnatural analogue. By utilizing this method we were able to replace all the natural tryptophans or leucines by their unnatural analogues in GBP which was confirmed by LC-ESI-MS-MS.
