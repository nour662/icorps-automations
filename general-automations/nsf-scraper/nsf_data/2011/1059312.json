 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) is a shared corpus that supports research across\r\nseveral disciplines: linguistics, computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics and\r\nmachine learning. It includes a wide variety of present-day American English texts annotated for\r\nseveral linguistic phenomena. Because MASC provides a unique resource, considerable\r\ncommunity momentum has grown up around it. This project builds upon this momentum to\r\nenable the corpus to grow on its own, and to address the need for additional annotations. The\r\nmajor activities are to : (1) provide web-based mechanisms to facilitate community contribution\r\nand use of MASC annotations; (2) develop means to more fully automate the annotation\r\nvalidation process; (3) extend the WordNet annotations to cover adjectives, to support research\r\non evaluation of ?subjective? annotations and harmonization of WordNet with other resources;\r\n(3) promote use of MASC and new annotations by diverse groups, by sponsoring shared tasks\r\nthat exploit the corpus? unique characteristics and supporting beta-testers of software, data, and\r\nannotations; and (4) aggressively develop an ?Open Language Data? community around MASC\r\nthrough workshops, tutorials, and active participation in relevant community activities.\r\n\r\nMASC provides an unparalleled resource for training and testing of tools for natural language\r\nprocessing, which can enable a major leap in the productivity of NLP research and ultimately\r\nimpact the way people use and interact with computers. It is the first fully open, communitydriven\r\nresource in the field. All data and annotations are freely distributed in a manner that\r\npermits immediate and easy accessibility for users around the globe.",
