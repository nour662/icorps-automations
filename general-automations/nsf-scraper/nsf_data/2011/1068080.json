 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research of Assistant Professor John T. Giblin, Jr. at Kenyon College.\r\n\r\nThe Cosmos is a laboratory in which we can test physics at extremely high energies.  As such, information about high-energy processes in the Cosmos provides one way of understanding the fundamental nature of matter, gravity, and the interactions of particles at those energies.  This award funds work that will help interpret the information we observe in the Cosmos, and will demonstrate how these observations are tied to theories of fundamental particle physics.  Professor Giblin and his students will use high-performance computing to simulate models of high-energy physics, and use these simulations to predict observational consequences of these models.  Once completed, this work will enable physicists to constrain a variety of different models and parameters --- results which may have implications for the design of the next generation of observational missions.\r\n\r\nThis award also addresses several broader needs.  First, it provides funding for undergraduate students over the next three years.  Meaningful undergraduate participation in original research is critical in inspiring the next generation of scientists and a critical part of scientific education.  Further, this award will fund a \"Saturday Science\" program at Kenyon College.  This program will bring two hundred middle-school students each year to campus and provide a sensory introduction to science.  Such programs are essential, particularly in rural communities, and will help bring young students into contact with professional scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe award \"Beyond Leading Order: Using Computation to Constrain Fundamental Physics\" was completed by Prof. John T. Giblin, Jr along with his students and collaborators at Kenyon College in Gambier Ohio.\n\nThis award made progress toward understanding many open questions in cosmology.  The majority of this award was devoted to developing numerical tools that simulate sophisticated models of particle physics&mdash;including models that include particles from the Standard Model of Particle physics and particles that are motivated by other models of particle physics.  These simulations were used to better understand the role that these models play in early Universe processes.  The processes studied include how the Universe reheated after cosmic inflation and the dynamics of fields and matter during phase transitions in the early Universe.  The results of this work will help to both constrain models but also will help the conversation between theorists and observers as the next generation of observatories are being planned.  We produced 9 peer reviewed publications and have released our software for public use on our website.\n\nOne of the avenues studied in detail under this proposal was the generation of gravitational radiation during several cosmological processes.  We studied this generation during preheating (the phase transition that ended inflation), during first-order phase transitions (like those that may have occurred at the electroweak and other scales) and in the wake of second order phase transitions.  We also have produced an argument that can help scientists to estimate some characteristics of gravitational wave signals from cosmological processes without having to do the large numerical simulations outlined in this work.\n\nIn addition this award funded many undergraduate research projects over the course of three years and helped support students over summer projects and during the school year.  Eight students were directly funded by this proposal; three of which have gone on to graduate study in physics and one of which has earned a commission in the United States Navy.  All are participating in STEM fields at this time.\n\nLastly, this award supported a \"Saturday Science\" program at Kenyon College.  Over the course of this program, 200 middle-school students came to Kenyon each year to participate in an interactive outreach program.  These students are given the chance to interact with science and mentors in a meaningful way.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John T Giblin"
