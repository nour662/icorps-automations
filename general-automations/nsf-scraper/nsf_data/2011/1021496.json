It is designed to be community-based, built on collaboration at a number of levels, interdisciplinary and comparative, providing a variety of lenses through which to understand Yup'ik environmental knowledge, holistic in its approach to understanding the dynamics of natural and human history on the Bering Sea coast, and methodologically innovative.\r\n\r\nThe project will be an important capacity-building process among community members, providing opportunities for local educators and students to work with social and natural scientists in an atmosphere of collegiality and mutual respect. Elder experts' and village representatives' involvement at every level of the research process ensures that community members' voices will be heard.  Major project deliverables will include bilingual and ethnographic publications, GIS place name maps and a place-based website for the Bering Sea coast, scientific reports and public presentations, and meeting transcripts in long-lived archives.",
