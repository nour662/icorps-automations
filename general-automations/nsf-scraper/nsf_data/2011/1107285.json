 "awd_abstract_narration": "The contribution of coastal margins to regional and global carbon budgets is\r\nnot well understood, largely due to limited information about the magnitude, spatial distribution,\r\nand interannual variability of carbon sources and sinks in coastal waters. The Ocean Carbon &\r\nBiogeochemistry (OCB) Program has been collaborating with the North American Carbon\r\nProgram (NACP) over the past two years to develop a Coastal Interim Synthesis Activity as part\r\nof the NACP Interim Synthesis activities, the goals of which are to bring together relevant\r\nobservations, data, and modeling efforts in an effort to identify and quantify key sources, sinks,\r\nstocks, fluxes, and associated processes in the North American carbon budget. The objective of\r\nthe Coastal Interim Synthesis Activity is to synthesize individual, small-scale observational and\r\nmodeling studies from different regions of the North American continental margin across\r\nbroader spatial and temporal scales to improve quantitative assessments of the North American\r\ncoastal carbon budget. Because the coastal oceans have important and complex linkages with\r\nterrestrial, atmospheric, and open ocean biogeochemical cycles, it is important to provide for the \r\nparticipation of researchers focused on both organic and inorganic carbon, as well as nitrogen\r\nand phosphorus cycle topics related to carbon balance and related issues such as hypoxia\r\nimpacts on continental margins.\r\n\r\nWith support through this award to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), OCB \r\nscientists from WHOI, the University of Alaska - Fairbanks, and the University of South Florida \r\nwill convene two workshops to facilitate data gathering and synthesis efforts related to coastal \r\ncarbon budgets in five regions?East Coast (including Gulf of Maine), West Coast (including Gulf \r\nof Alaska), Gulf of Mexico, Arctic (including marginal seas such as the Bering, Chukchi, Beaufort, \r\nand Baffin-Labrador), and Great Lakes.  Additional funding to support these efforts will be provided \r\nby NASA and NOAA.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Coastal margins represent a significant unknown in the North American\r\ncarbon budget. By leveraging the shared community expertise of two leading U.S. carbon cycle\r\nscience programs (NACP and OCB), this project will improve coastal carbon sink/source\r\nestimates and facilitate the community interaction needed to ensure a seamless transition\r\nbetween land and sea in our understanding of the most important processes driving the North\r\nAmerican carbon cycle. The proposed approach convenes scientists with specialized\r\nknowledge of regionally important physical and biogeochemical processes to develop robust\r\nregional coastal carbon budgets that more effectively account for some of the inherent spatial\r\nand temporal variability of coastal systems. Another key outcome of this project will be a\r\ntremendously valuable historic dataset that will improve our understanding of the carbon cycle\r\nand inform public discussion and policy making on issues related to climate change, human\r\nhealth, and fisheries, all of which are intimately linked to carbon cycling. Recovery of these data\r\nand their incorporation into a publicly accessible data base will enhance the development of\r\npredictive models for coastal regions and also enable more comprehensive linkage of land,\r\natmosphere, and ocean modeling of carbon dioxide and the carbon cycle. There are currently\r\n>50 years of observations in most U.S. coastal regions, providing much-needed historical\r\ncontext to monitor the health of coastal ocean ecosystems, which are becoming increasingly\r\nvulnerable to threats of ocean acidification, eutrophication, and hypoxia.",
