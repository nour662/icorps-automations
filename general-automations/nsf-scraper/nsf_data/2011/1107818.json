  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes (EAPSI) Fellowship afforded me the opportunity to conduct original research under the tutelage of a Kiwi scientist at Victoria University of Wellington.  Furthermore, I was able to live in, and experience the culture of, New Zealand.  While working in Wellington, I utilized seismic data collected from an array of recently deployed ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) to better constrain the degree of anisotropy underlying the South Island.  Anisotropy is the property of directional dependence and is considered a global characteristic of Earth\u00c6s interior.[1] The study of seismic anisotropy is becoming of great interest to the seismological community.  It is arguably the best way to quantify strain at depth, thus informing our understanding of continental dynamics at a plate boundary.  This better insight into the relationship between seismic anisotropy and continental dynamics has direct application to earthquake hazards since a better understanding of how seismic waves travel through a certain region can result in better engineered structures to withstand earthquakes.\n\nSpecific to New Zealand, previous investigations demonstrated that the subsurface below the South Island is highly anisotropic.[2,3,4] Currently, two  models are proposed to explain this observed anisotropy.  Klosko et al. argue that seismic anisotropy is the result of localized deformation along the Alpine Fault (the plate boundary between the Australian and Pacific plates traversing most the length of the South Island) extending from the surface to the upper mantle.[3] On the other hand, Molnar et al. suggest that the mantle lithosphere deforms continuously under a rigid crust.[4]\n\nMy work in New Zealand aimed at discriminating between these two proposed mechanisms of deformation around the Alpine Fault.  Our current understanding of South Island anisotropy is informed solely from seismic data collected on land, thus creating the need to deploy the OBS array.  Specifically, I investigated the splitting of SKS waves that were recorded across the OBS array.  The SKS phase represents a seismic wave that has traveled from the earthquake epicenter as an S-wave (amplitude of oscillation perpendicular to direction of travel), converted into a P-wave (amplitude of oscillation parallel to direction of travel) at the Earth\u00c6s outer core, and finally converted back into an S-wave as it reenters the mantle.  In anisotropic media, such seismic waves can undergo shear wave splitting, where the shear wave is split into two orthogonal components that appear spatially separated on a seismogram because each component travels at a different speed through the medium.  Utilizing numerical methods, it is possible to determine the split time magnitude between the two orthogonal components, as well as the fast direction of the anisotropy.  This information helps us generate a map of the measured anisotropy.\n\nResults indicate that lateral variations in anisotropy exist beneath the South Island.  In general, we see a fast direction off the west coast that is aligned parallel to the Alpine Fault.  Off the east coast, the fast directions are oblique to the fault.  This observed pattern indicates that a continuously deforming mantle lithosphere cannot account for the observed anisotropy.  The observed fast directions off the west coast are consistent with a localized region of deformation around the Alpine Fault; however, we must also acknowledge that without more work, the observed anisotropy could also simply represent residual anisotropy from plate motion.\n\nThe opportunity to live and work in New Zealand helped advance me both scientifically and personally.  I was able to generate great working relationships between scientists at both the University and at other Crown Institutions within New Zealand.  It was also fantastic to be able to directly interact with the land that I was investigating, as well as the people who daily lived within that ..."
