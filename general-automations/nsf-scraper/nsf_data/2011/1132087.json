 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nThe International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences (ISAES) is held every four years and is a premier Antarctic research conference. The 11th ISAES meeting will be held 10-16 July 2011 in Edinburgh, Scotland. ISAES is a key platform for generating or augmenting international collaborations and this travel grant will help make this conference accessible for graduate students and early-career researchers. Symposium presentations and publications will provide a key record of International Polar Year activities in the earth sciences in Antarctica, and an invaluable resource for planning future, international, collaborative research. Funds are requested to support the attendance of 20- 25 U.S. researchers at this conference. In particular, the funds will be used to support graduate students and young investigators who currently do not have sufficient travel support. Requests for support will be evaluated by the PIs and a group of geoscientists from the Byrd Polar Research Center and School of Earth Sciences at The Ohio State University.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nThese funds will allow a more diverse group of researchers to participate in the ISAES conference, which will encourage global collaboration and cooperation. Travel funds will preferentially be provided for students and early career researcher and thus will augment their training and career development.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGroup Travel to the 11th International Symposium on \nAntarctic Earth Sciences (ISAES), Edinburgh, Scotland\n\n \n\nThis award funded participation of U.S. students and early career scientists in the International Antarctic Earth Science Symposium in Edinburgh, Scotland, U.K.  Fifty applications were received.  Nine applications were declined - eight of these were senior scientists.  Thirty-one awards were made, and negotiations with funded advisors resulted in 10 additional students/early career scientists funded by other means.  Awards, and negotiated funding, included 1 B.Sc. student, 12 M.Sc. students, 21 PhD students (34 students total), and 8 early career scientists.   Participants from 22 institutions distributed across the U.S. were funded.\n\nFunded participants presented contributions across the spectrum of thematic sessions at the conference.  In broad groupings, 17 earth science presentations, 5 glacial geology presentations, 16 earth/cryosphere presentations, 5 glaciological presentations, and 4 earth/biosphere/hydrosphere presentations were made by funded participants.  It is particularly notable that the majority of presentations by these students and early career scientists were cross-disciplinary - the new trend in Antarctic earth sciences.\n\nThese conference participants had a particularly valuable experience in international polar science. The size of the conference meant that individual students and early career scientists had ample opportunity to interact directly with leading scientists from the full range of nations conducting earth science research in Antarctica.  In addition, extensive opportunity for networking with other young scientists from many nations was provided by both general conference activities and by specific activities convened by the Association of Polar Early Career scientists.\n\nThe U.S. scientists funded by this award represented the range and breadth of NSF-OPP earth science research to the international audience at this key conference.\n\nThe interdisciplinary, and multinational, character of the International Antarctic Earth Science Symposium (ISAES), highlights the cross-disciplinary nature of Antarctic earth science research.  The large numbers of cross-disciplinary contributions by U.S. students and early career scientists shows that multidisciplinary research is now the standard in much of Antarctic research.\n\nThis award, together with negotiated shared funding, allowed 41 students and early career scientists to participate in the premier Antarctic earth science symposium.  Each of these participants benefited from a unique experience in the multinational, multidisciplinary research that characterizes current research in Antarctica.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/08/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Terry J Wilson"
