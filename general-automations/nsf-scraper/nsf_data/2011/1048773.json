 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor Mark Ratner and colleagues Joseph Hupp, Tobin Marks, SonBinh Nguyen and J. Fraser Stoddart from Northwestern University will acquire a 400 MHz spectrometer. The proposal will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) unlocking the synthetic potential of n-allylhydrazones, (b) bimetallic ethylene polymerization: integrated synthetic, mechanistic, and polymerization studies, and photonics, plasmonics and molecule-based nanomaterials, (c) molecular logic for nanoelectronics, (d) synthesis and characterization of metal-organic frameworks from start to finish, (e) characterization of the surface of colloidal quantum dot (QDs) and its correspondence to their electronic and optical properties, and (f) design and synthesis of novel catalysts for green chemistry and environmental remediation.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to follow the progress of chemical reactions, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solids and in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to carry out frontier chemistry related research and to train students in modern research techniques. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact on organic, materials, electronics, environmental and bioorganic chemistry research at Northwestern University. The instrument will be available to users at other institutions including Harold Washington College and Roosevelt University. The resources will be used not only for research activities but also for research training of undergraduate and graduate students including those from underrepresented groups.",

The synthesis of new compounds fuels studies in the areas of catalysis, chemical biology, medicine, supramolecular chemistry, nanotechnology, drug development, energy storage and materials science at NU. Characterization of these novel compounds by NMR spectroscopy is used to determine connectivity within a molecule and 3D structure.  This characterization is required to develop new chemical reactions, to publish results of new syntheses and evaluate the purity of compounds before applications testing occurs. \n\nAs an example, in the area of alternative fuels, the Hupp group is interested in creating novel material which can be used to safely store large amounts of methane or hydrogen for use in vehicles.  These materials are based on carboxylic acid containing organic ligands bound to metal atoms to create high surface area metal oxide frameworks.  Before the new materials can be tested for gas storage, the organic ligands (Figure 1a) must be synthesized and characterized by multiple NMR techniques and crystals must be grown showing large voids needed for gas storage.  Without adequate NMR capacity, projects such as these will stall at the earliest stages.\n\nThis award from NSF-CRIF has enabled the purchase of a new 400 MHz NMR system which is now located in the Technological Institute at Northwestern University (Figure 2).  Prior to this award, NU created the Integrated Molecular Structure Education and Research Center (IMSERC) in 2008 to provide a single site for molecular characterization instrumentation for both sponsored research and hands-on undergraduate education.
