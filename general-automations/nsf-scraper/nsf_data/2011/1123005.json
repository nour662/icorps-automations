 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially support a three-day meeting of U.S. principal investigators funded to conduct ocean acidification research.  It is designed to build capacity within the ocean acidification research community, to advance scientific research on ocean acidification as efficiently as possible, and to clarify the scientific frontiers within ocean acidification research. The invitees include approximately 20% early-career scientists and 30% women. The specific goals of the meeting are (1) Strengthen scientific collaborations and minimize duplication of efforts; (2)  Build capacity for improving ocean acidification research; (3) Identify short- and long-term research goals; (4) Promote effective data management; (5) Enhance communication with the public; and (6) Solicit feedback from the scientific community to guide future activities. The meeting includes a mix of plenary talks reviewing state-of-the-art knowledge on 5 themes of ocean acidification research; synthesis presentations and panel discussions considering how present research efforts fit together; breakout sessions discussing overarching challenges in ocean acidification research; poster sessions; and plenary discussions concerning future directions in ocean acidification research.",
