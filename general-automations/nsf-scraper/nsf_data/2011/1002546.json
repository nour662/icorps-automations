 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds for the construction of the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma-ray observatory to be built at Sierra Negra in Mexico. The costs for hardware, engineering, and contract (nonscientist) labor to build HAWC are being provided here. The observations of HAWC will probe the most extreme environments in the Universe, providing a unique view of non-thermal processes in the Galaxy and beyond. The key science goals of HAWC are to: (a) Measure the spectrum of Galactic sources to the highest energies; (b) Map the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission from 1 TeV to 100 TeV measuring the cosmic-ray flux and spectrum across the Galaxy; (c) Study transient emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN); (d) Monitor the sky for 100 GeV emission from gamma-ray bursts; and (e) Search for new TeV physics with HAWC's unbiased sky survey. HAWC measurements have the potential to shed light on the fundamental symmetries of nature, including the search for Lorentz violation at extreme energies, the search for the dark matter in the universe, and the direct detection of massive relic particles.\r\n\r\nHAWC is an array consisting of 250 large water tanks, each instrumented with three photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) mounted on the bottom of the tank. The tanks will cover an area of ~20,000 square meters. The expanded detection, increased altitude and optical isolation of the detector elements lead to a 15-fold increase in sensitivity relative to Milagro, which performed the deepest wide-field survey of the TeV sky to date. Refinement of the design and cost has been achieved through prototyping and deploying a test array at the HAWC site. The cost estimate and design sensitivity have stayed roughly constant through the development process. The goal is to begin taking data while the array is under construction and to be online within approximately three years. This will allow HAWC to run while the Fermi mission is ongoing.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: HAWC is an all-sky instrument that will have the sensitivity to extend the measurement of satellite-discovered sources to TeV energies. HAWC will build on the strong outreach record of Milagro to bring this exciting field of research to students and the general public. Since HAWC is a joint US-Mexican project, this will be an excellent opportunity to attract talented Hispanic students to the field of Particle Astrophysics and to Physics in general. The group has developed an outreach video about HAWC and web materials about HAWC and Particle Astrophysics in both Spanish and English.",

TeV gamma rays are the highest energy photons ever observed &mdash; 1 TeV is 1 trillion electron volts (eV), about 1 trillion times more energetic than visible light! These photons are born in the most extreme environments in the known universe: supernova explosions, active galactic nuclei, and gamma-ray bursts. <br /><br />Cosmic rays are charged particles which achieve energies far beyond what we can create in man-made particle accelerators. The origin of such particles has been a mystery for over 100 years. Gamma rays are thought to be correlated with the acceleration sites of charged cosmic rays, so by observing them we can help to answer this and other cosmic questions.<br /><br />HAWC is located on the flanks of the Sierra Negra volcano near Puebla, Mexico at an altitude of 4100 meters (13,500 feet). HAWC was built through joint funding of NSF and DOE in the US and CONACyT in Mexico beginning in February&nbsp; 2011. In 19 months we leveled the &sim;25,000&nbsp;m2 site, built the HAWC utility building, installed the counting house, ran electrical power and internet to both buildings and began full-scale construction. Construction of the entire 300 tank array took just over 4 years from the funding start and was substantially completed in March of 2015. HAWC was completed on time and on budget and is working at near or better than its design specifications. The detector has an instantaneous field of view covering 15% of the sky, and during each 24 hour period HAWC observes two-thirds of the sky.&nbsp; Using the HAWC Observatory, we are performing the most sensitive wide-field survey of high energy gamma rays from the Northern Hemisphere. <br /><br />The HAWC observatory is synergistic to other gamma-ray observatories, neutrino detectors and even gravitational wave observatories. HAWC has not only detected new sources, but has both initiated, and participated in, multi-messenger observations with other observatories. The main objectives of the HAWC collaboration are to contribute to the study of the origin of cosmic rays via its observations of gamma-rays up to 100&nbsp;TeV from discrete sources and the Galactic plane, to understand particle acceleration in astrophysical jets using HAWC&rsquo;s wide field of view and high duty factor observations of transient sources (such as gamma-ray bursts and supermassive black holes), and to explore new TeV physics via HAWC&rsquo;s unbiased survey of the sky.<br /><br />HAWC consists of an array of 300 Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs), which cover an area of about 22,500&nbsp;m2. Each WCD is a 4.5&nbsp;m high by 7.3&nbsp;m diameter steel tank fitted with a custom light-tight bladder. Each tank holds 188,000 liters (50,000 gallons) of filtered water and contains four upward-facing photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) attached to the bottom. The PMTs are used to detect the Cherenkov light produced in the water by the shower of particles, initiated by a cosmic ray particle, that move downward through the atmosphere in a &ldquo;pancake\" shape at nearly the speed of light. By recording the arrival time of the light pulse across the detector the original direction of the cosmic can be determined to within a small fraction of a degree. The pattern of light is used to discriminate between charged cosmic-ray initiated showers and those coming from gamma rays. This allows HAWC to make gamma-ray maps of the entire overhead sky in the TeV energy range. Because HAWC operates 24-7 and has a wide field-of-view, it can observe rare high energy events and is the ideal instrument to look for gamma-ray transients which have been observed from the super-massive cores of other galaxies and provide to alerts to other pointed instruments.<br /><br />We have involved numerous undergraduates and graduate students in the construction, analysis and operation of the HAWC detector. We also have a significant outreach program.&nbsp; Since HAWC is located in Mexico, we have produced a number of videos for outreach (several can be found on YouTube) explaining the science of HAWC (in English and Spanish). In addition, we have developed web materials about HAWC and the field of Particle Astrophysics in both Spanish and English for use in both Mexico and the US. For our inauguration in March of 2015, in addition to a science symposium in Puebla attended by ~350 people, we arranged a poster competition in the towns of Atzizintla and Texmalaquilla near the HAWC site. School children learned about the project and then made posters which were displayed at the school which was visited by the inauguration guests on their way to the HAWC site for the ceremony.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/02/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jordan&nbsp;A&nbsp;Goodman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1002546/1002546_10069997_1488340064182_HAWCPanoramaNov2017a--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1002546/1002546_10069997_1488340064182_HAWCPanoramaNov2017a--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"HAWC Panorama November 2016\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1002546/1002546_10069997_1488340064182_HAWCPanoramaNov2017a--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"HAWC Panorama November 2016\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">View of the HAWC site at 4100m above sea level in Mexico.
