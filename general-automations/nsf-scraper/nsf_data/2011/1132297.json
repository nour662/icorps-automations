 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the origin of the Universe, cosmology, is one of humankind's fundamental endeavors.  Close study of clusters of galaxies remains a critical element in this pursuit.  The aim of this conference is for the first time to gather scientists worldwide for the study of cosmology with X-ray, Suyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) and associated astronomical observations of clusters.\r\n\r\nOne important feature of clusters of galaxies is the huge volume and mass of hot gas that permeates the space between member galaxies. This hot gas is visible in X-rays and is substantial enough that it causes the light remaining from the birth of the Universe---known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)---to shift ever so slightly toward the blue end of the light spectrum.  This slight shift of the CMB is detectable and can be used to locate large clusters of galaxies over a wide range of distances and to measure important cosmological parameters that describe and characterize the origin of the Universe. This conference will bring together many American and international scientists involved in current X-ray and SZE experiments to discuss current progress, the latest results, and the many remaining puzzles. The unique aspect of this conference is to facilitate interactions of scientists focused on different observational approaches (i.e., X-ray, SZE, others) so that the community will gain greater insight by combining the knowledge base of these different approaches.\r\n\r\nThe proposed four-day conference is structured as a workshop to allow ample time for substantial discussions following each talk and each session.  A key objective is to involve students and recent graduates. NSF, which is funding about 25% of the total estimated cost of the conference, will be primarily supporting the modest travel expenses of 30 students and recent graduates to attend the conference.  The organizers are committing substantial effort to recruit speakers, participants, and students from groups underrepresented in the sciences.  The organizers will also produce a volume of the proceedings, including all oral and poster presentations.  Holding this conference in the United States will benefit many US students and scientists who would otherwise be unable to attend a similar or related conference overseas.  Finally, the proposed effort should have a substantial impact on the training of young STEM researchers and to connect them with international collaborators---supporting the two NSF Strategic Goals that follow: To prepare and engage a diverse STEM workforce motivated to participate at the frontiers.  To keep the United States globally competitive at the frontiers of knowledge by increasing international partnerships and collaborations.",
