 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds research in economic theory.  The goal is to develop a new foundation for the Nash bargaining solution, a basic scientific insight about the likely outcome of bargaining processes.  This concept was originally developed using an axiomatic approach.  Later research in game theory demonstrated that this same outcome was predicted by non-cooperative strategic behavior if the two parties to a bargain were negotiating through alternative offers.  However, bargaining happens in many different contexts, and whether or not the Nash solution is the predicted outcome of strategic bargaining in other contexts is an unanswered question.\r\n\r\nThe PI and his research team are developing a new method to build a decentralized strategic foundation for the Nash bargaining solution that will apply to many different possible bargaining methods or protocols.  The key idea is that the bargaining process emerges endogenously, rather than being assumed ex ante.  The research addresses fundamental questions about the kind of social dynamics that will sustain the Nash bargaining solution as an equilibrium steady state.  This will allow them to assess how plausible the solution concept is for alternative models of the economy.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include the possible use of this new model and methods in a wide range of social sciences that use game theory to develop hypotheses about bargaining outcomes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA typical labor market does not clear.  At the same time workers who are willing to work at the prevailing wage remain unemployed (involuntary unemployment), many firms cannot hire workers at the prevailing wage (involuntary vacancy). The coexistence of involuntary unemployment and involuntary vacancy is a major challenge to economic theory, as well as policy makers.   Our research objective is to investigate the foundation of the competitive market through the dynamic decentralized markets to understand whether and how such a coexistence can arise, so that we can prescribe an effective remedy to the market.       The conventional approach is to explain the coexistence as a consequence of search friction.    In order to find a job, or a worker, it takes time.    During the search, a worker who is willing to work for a firm may remain unemployed, and a firm who wants to hire a workers at a prevailing wage may not fill the vacancy.   Widespread use of the internet reduces the search cost in many markets, including the labor market.   Yet, the coexistence of unemployment and vacancy persists, and shows no sign of vanishing.     We claim that the informational asymmetry is a major source for the coexistence, and furthermore, prove that even if the search process is efficient and search friction vanishes, the information asymmetry can generate the coexistence of involuntary unemployment and vacancy.    In pursing this goal, we also identify what type of informational asymmetry can cause the coexistence.   By identifying the precise source and the mechanism for the coexistence, we can develop the right policy measures.\n\nWe achieve this goal in three steps   First, we investigate a baseline model in which all sellers and all buyers are ex ante identical.     A buyer and a seller are randomly matched, and trade if and only if the two parties agree on the price.  Upon reaching agreement, they leave the pool, and maintain the long term relationship, until the long term relationship dissolves with a small probability.   If the agents do not reach agreement, they stay in the pool until each player is matched to a partner to form a long term relationship.      Our question is whether the dynamic outcome can emulate the competitive market outcome, and if the competitive market admits multiple equilibrium prices, whether the dynamic model can provide a criterion for selecting a particular equilibrium.     \n\nIn the second step, we relax the assumption of ex ante homogeneous sellers and buyers, assuming instead that each agent has private information about his valuation of the object, and that the negotiation is carried out under two sided asymmetric information.   Our question is whether the dispersed information about the valuation is aggregated into the market clearing price so that the dynamic market can achieve efficient allocation.\n\nIn the third step, we examine a model with a different kind of asymmetric information where a seller has private information about the common value component of the object such as quality.   In contrast to the private value model, examined in the second step, the buyer does not know  the true quality of the good, at the time when he decides upon the long term contract.    We examine the market outcome, in order to understand whether the asymmetric information about the common value can make substantive difference to the market outcome.\n\nWe found that if no agent has private information about the common value component, such as the models examined in the first two steps, the dynamic trading model can approximate the competitive market outcome.    The dynamic decentralized trading process can aggregate dispersed information so that as friction vanishes, the prices converge to the competitive equilibrium price, and the allocation becomes efficient.    In contrast, if some agents have private information about the common value component of the commodity, then the allocation must be inefficient.   With the presen..."
