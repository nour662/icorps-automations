 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main aim of this proposal is to investigate a few questions in birational geometry. The first parts intends to study rationally connected varieties, which are the simplest algebraic varieties from many points of view. For non-proper varieties, there are various definitions of rational connectedness.\r\nThe proposer will study their relations. He will also continue his study on the arithmetic property of rationally connected varieties. The other parts focus on the boundedness type questions of varieties or pairs. Especially, when the pair is of log general type, the PI investigator is trying to establish the uniform properties of their volumes.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic varieties are roughly speaking the figures described by the solutions of polynomials. Algebraic geometry is a subject which aims to classify all algebraic varieties. In the birational sense, algebraic varieties are built up by some specific types of varieties. Rationally connected varieties and general type varieties are such fundamental building blocks. To understand them will largely improve our understanding of all algebraic varieties.",
