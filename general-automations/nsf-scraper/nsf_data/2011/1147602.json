 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to provision energy-efficient communications by powering wireless access networks with renewable energy. Wireless access networks and the power grid are envisioned to be deployed in a distributed manner in which a distributed base station consumes less amount of power that can be generated by renewable energy. Optimization theory and game theory are applied to study the interaction between the wireless access networks and the power grids, to optimize the operation of wireless access networks by integrating the power distribution of the micro grid into the design and optimization of the wireless access networks, and to design the operation of the micro grid by considering characteristics of both the power demand of the consumers (wireless access networks) and the distributed energy resources (renewable power generators).  The research explores the potential of applying renewable energy into powering wireless networks, and stimulates the large scale application of renewable energy in helping green the society and reduce the carbon footprint of the environment. Two major results are anticipated: 1) the algorithms that optimize the operation of renewable energy powered wireless networks (REPWiNet), and 2) the communication protocols that coordinate the wireless access network with the underlying power grids. The insights and results derived from designing REPWiNet will provide guidelines not only for designing wireless access networks but also for designing the power distribution and coordination in micro grids. Research results will be posted on a website as well as submitted for publications in journals and presentations at premium conferences.",
