 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continued support for the experimental particle physics program at SUNY-Stony Brook. The intellectual merit will be new understanding of underlying causes for the breaking of the symmetry in the fundamental forces of nature and searches for physics not described by the Standard Model. This will be done in two experimental programs. The major effort will be with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, where the group will continue support for the calorimeters with an emphasis on measuring electrons, photons, missing energy and long lived-particles that enable studies of W/Z bosons in association with heavy quarks. Active participation in the early physics will include measurement of W boson properties, measuring production of W bosons with jets, and new particle searches. Participating in the D\u00d8 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron the program will extend the search for the Higgs boson, allowing its exclusion if it does not exist within the expected range 115-158 GeV, or finding evidence for its existence if it does. In addition, the group will extend its study of the like-sign dimuon asymmetry, where current results suggest an unexpected CP-violation in the B-sub(s) system and a possible explanation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The broader impact includes 1) development of improved training for high school teachers, 2) continued support for the Mariachi Project that installs detectors to sense high energy cosmic rays in high school classrooms across the region, 3) public outreach through talks on physics research, accelerators and technological spinoffs, and 4) emphasizing in the training of students and postdoctoral scientists the learning of new techniques and effective communication, thereby enabling them to take leadership positions in science and technology industry or government.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     As members of the ATLAS Collaboration we have discovered the Higgs boson and measured its mass to be 125.09&plusmn;0.24 GeV--or 133.32 times the mass of the proton within an accuracy of 0.2%.\n\n     As members of the D0 Collaboration we have measured the mass of the W boson to be 80.383&plusmn;0.023 GeV--or 85.671 times the mass of the proton, within an accuracy of 0,03%.\n\n     Using the mass of the W boson and the mass of the top quark, the mass of the Higgs boson can be predicted  by the theory of the Standard Model.  The measjured mass  of the Higgs boson is right where it was predicted to be given the measured masses of the W  boson and the top quark.  This is a tremendous success of the Standard Model.\n\n     With the ATLAS Collaboration we have searched for leptoquarks and evidence for supersymmetric particles, phenomena which would be beyond the Standard Model.  We found no such evidence and set appropriate limits indicating where such effects could still be.\n\n     With D0 we set similar limits on the production of the Standard Model Higgs boson with two tau laptons and two jets.\n\n    With ATLAS we have studied diboson production--the production of two bosons together: WW, WZ or ZZ.  The measured cross section for WW production with leptons is consitent with the standard Model but seems high.  A more accurate measurement is needed.  In the all-jet final state we have found that diboson events at a mass of 2 TeV show an excess above a smooth falling background which is approaching significance.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Hobbs"
