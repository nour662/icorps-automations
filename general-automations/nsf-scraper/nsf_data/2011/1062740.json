 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to bring nine students per summer to The University of Texas at Tyler for a memorable research experience for undergraduates.  Students will work closely with three faculty members on projects in knot theory, tiling theory, and combinatorics on words that have been carefully chosen to be both accessible and significant.  As part of the program, the students will write a research paper containing their results and give an oral presentation which will enhance their communication skills.  The research experience will be complemented by several organized outings and social activities to encourage peer networking and bonding.\r\n\r\nThe three faculty mentors are all first-generation college students, including one female American Indian; they all had an undergraduate research experience that shaped their lives and careers and have taken nationally recognized courses in undergraduate pedagogy to pass that legacy on.  It is intended that this summer program will show students that mathematical research can be both fun and interesting, with the hope that this experience paves the way to graduate studies.  This proposal aims to recruit students from underrepresented groups; in particular, American Indians, women, and first generation college students.",
