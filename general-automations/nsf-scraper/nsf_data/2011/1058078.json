 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop the next-generation chip-scale Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) gyroscopes for use in wireless devices that now require unprecedented device performance with minimum possible footprint. For instance, inertial navigation and motion sensing in most cellular devices require gyroscopes with small size, high sensitivity and stability, low drift and low power consumption. Most MEMS gyroscopes used in consumer electronics and wireless devices do not yet meet all the criteria for large-scale deployment in the fastest growing segment of the market: handheld devices. Existing MEMS gyroscopes are fundamentally limited by their underlying technology - electrostatic actuation and detection of vibration and rotational amplitudes. For this research project, a new approach has been proposed to the engineering of MEMS gyroscopes that can detect 3-axis rotation with unprecedented sensitivity and stability with minimal footprint. The goals of the Phase II project are to (i) develop both 2-axis (x-y) and hybrid 3-axis (x-y, z) micromechanical gyroscopes; (ii) develop associated driving and sensing integrated circuits (IC); (iii) test and characterize the devices for optimal performance parameters; (iv) bond the IC wafer to the MEMS wafer with wafer-level packaging. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in the consumer wireless systems market with the standing promise of an integrated single-chip inertial sensor and timing device. Micromechanical gyroscopes have increasing relevance in inertial navigation systems and automotive applications. Beyond these applications which require devices with better sensitivity and stability, a host of new applications in consumer electronics have suddenly emerged. In particular, handheld devices such as cellular devices and GPS systems, and gaming consoles such as the Nintendo Wii now include miniature gyroscopes that must have extremely small footprint and consume very little power. The proposed approach lends itself to natural chip-scale integration with timing devices for future production of Timing and Inertial Motion-Sensing Units (TIMU), necessary for next generation inertial navigation. Another commercial impact will be on the chip manufacturing industry, as the integrated circuits (IC) wafers will be fabricated in the United States, in potentially high volumes. Sand 9 is involved in the proactive employment of women and minorities in its engineering team, towards its commitment to the creation of a diverse, next-generation workforce in the MEMS industry.",
