This project is to design and develop a new class of strain gradient sensor (SGS) that can detect damage at a very early stage and in-situ monitor the damage initiation and progression.  This FE-microstructure sensor enables ultra-sensitive sensing of strain gradient which is most sensitive measurand near the localized damage location. Motivated by recent progress on FE structure and microfabrication the proposed efforts will, for the first time, design, fabricate, and characterize the flexoelectric microstructures for strain gradient sensing. \r\n\r\nThe research to be undertaken consists of three major tasks including fabrication of FE microstructures, material tailoring and characterization of FE microstructures, design and prototype SGS devices. This study will lay the groundwork for a new class of strain gradient sensor (SGS) with high strain gradient sensitivity, low signal to noise ratio and broad bandwidth. The proposed work will significantly advance scientific and engineering knowledge in the area of structure damage sensing technology and greatly enhance the capability of early damage detection and in-situ health monitoring of nation's infrastructure systems.  A corresponding education and outreach program involving women and minority students is developed and integrated with the planned research program.  The planned collaboration with NASA centers and Boeing through test plan development will promote the integration of academic research with industrial participation.",
