 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports Christopher Johnson of Yale University as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.  Dr. Johnson will work on studying the structure and dynamics of the gas-phase clusters that are thought to be important precursors in the formation of atmospheric aerosols.  The PI will collaborate with scientists at the Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment.  The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of the fundamental chemistry and physics of atmospheric aerosol formation and growth.  For his plan for broadening participation, Dr. Johnson will develop simple hands-on models for use by students and members of the public, which make clear how modern chemical instrumentation works.  \r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. Johnson is aimed at developing an improved understanding of the chemistry and physics behind the formation of atmospheric aerosols.  This is an area of research for which there is currently a great deal of uncertainty.  This uncertainty hinders the development of e.g. more accurate models of the climate.  The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Johnson are aimed at educating young people from underrepresented groups about modern chemical instrumentation, in the hopes of encouraging these young people to consider careers in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGlobal climate change is a pressing problem in the world today, and our ability to understand the extent to which it is a problem and the extent to which humans are causing it is directly linked to sophisticated global climate simulations.  These models try to combine everything that is known about the atmosphere and processes occurring in it, and are constantly being improved as new data is added and new atmospheric processes are understood.  Currently, one of the largest sources of uncertainty, and thus need of understanding, is the effect of aerosols on the overall heating or cooling of the atmosphere.  Aerosols are nanometer- to millimeter-sized particles that can serve as seeds for clouds, rain drops, and ice particles in the atmosphere. They are formed either by direct emission to the atmosphere in particle form (soot, dust, etc.) or by the clustering of trace molecules suspended in air in a process called new particle formation.\n\nThis project has laid the groundwork for a fundamental understanding of how these new particles form, with the hopes that this will eventually lead to an accurate treatment of this process in climate models and a better understanding of how human and animal activity contribute to the overall balance of aerosols in the atmosphere.  This work has yielded the first experimental data on the structures of the sub-nanometer molecular clusters that form the smallest particles in the atmosphere.  These particles, primarily composed of sulfuric acid and ammonia (a base), undergo acid-base chemistry in the form of proton transfer from sulfuric acid to ammonia to form a tiny salt crystal of ammonium bisulfate.  This acid-base reaction stabilizes the cluster so that collisions of the particle with gaseous molecules can lead to growth through further reactions. \n\nIn this work, the specific structures of the smallest ammonium bisulfate particles have been determined using infrared spectroscopy.  Each molecular component of the particle has characteristic vibrations (motions of the atoms in the molecule), and each of these vibrations is induced by absorption of light at a certain wavelength.  By monitoring what wavelengths of light are absorbed, it is possible to find a \"fingerprint\" of each component of the particle.  We have monitored how these fingerprints change as the particle grows and when reactions occur in the particle, and we find that these particles behave like tiny salt crystals.  By comparing the fingerprints to those predicted by quantum chemical calculations, we can determine what the structure of the particle is - particularly how the molecular components are joined together.  In this case, the \"glue\" that holds the particles together are the protons that are transferred in the acid-base reaction.  An example structure is shown in the image attached to this report.  This arrangement agrees well with existing predictions of what these particles might look like.  We have worked to characterize the strange fingerprint of these glue protons, which is much more complex than typical fingerprints.\n\nWe have also uncovered a new mechanism for how ammonia might be removed from these particles after they are formed.  We found that these clusters can absorb several (3-4) photons of light efficiently at certain wavelengths, which causes them to shrink by losing an ammonia molecule.  Sunlight contains these wavelengths, which means that this process could occur in the atmosphere.  If so, then the loss of ammonia leaves behind a bare \"glue\" proton which could cause other molecules to stick to the cluster, leading to increased growth rates.  We do not currently know if this process is competitive with others happening in the atmosphere, and this will require more work.\n\nFinally, we have investigated salt dissolution, which is still a fundamental question in chemical physics but also may play an important role in the atmosphere.  Since these newly formed particles are salty, if they react with atmospheric wa..."
