 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Division of Chemistry supports research by Professor Mahdi Abu-Omar at Purdue University to study electron transfer, proton-coupled electron transfer, and hydrogen atom transfer reactions.  In addition, the catalysis of C-H amination, nitrene transfer and hydrogen atom transfer reactions by nonheme iron(IV) imido complexes will be explored.  A molecular catalyst that mimics the enzyme chlorite dismutase and is selective for chlorite dismutation to dioxygen and innocuous chloride will also be investigated.  The manganese porphyrin system and nonheme catalysts that perform these reactions will be completely characterized.\r\n\r\nThis research will study how electrons and atoms transfer between molecules and will investigate molecular mimics of the enzyme chlorite dismutase.  These investigations involve chemical synthesis, catalysis, kinetics, and mechanisms, which will prepare postdoctoral and graduate students for academic, industrial, and government careers.  Collaborations with leading scientists in Japan (Professor Fukuzumi, Osaka University) and Korea (Professor Nam, Ewha Womans University) will further broaden the students' scientific perspectives.",

Inspired by nature, the goal of this project has been to devise compounds based on earth-abundant elements, iron and manganese, that can emulate the chemistry that occurs in nature to turn chlorine containing ions into oxygen and chloride. In addition to potential use in remediation, new chemistries were explored for making powerful disinfectants under mild conditions and on-demand. The use of  manganese compounds as catalysts was demonstrated for making chlorine dioxide disinfectant solutions in water under mild conditions. The molecular chemistry and rates of reactions responsible for these important transformations were investigated and clarified.\n\nIn many reactions that are essential to life and energy storage, high-valent metal oxo compounds act as mediators of electron, hydrogen atom, or proton transfer. These reactions are important in conversion of renewable energy to chemical energy and in making useful materials from renewable resources. In this project metal oxo compounds were studied and employed as catalysts for electrochemical conversion of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, an industrially important chemical that is made via indirect routes that generate waste and are energy intensive.
