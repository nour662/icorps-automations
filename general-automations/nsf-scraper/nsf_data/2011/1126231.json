 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Rongson Pongdee from University of the South and colleagues Robert Bachman, Deon Miles and John Shibata will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) glycodiversification of angucycline antibiotics, (b) study of condensed phase platinum(II) complexes containing bipyridine ligands modified with Guerbet alcohols, (c) surface characterization of water-soluble, monolayer-protected quantum dots, and (d) studies of motion dynamics of peptides.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
