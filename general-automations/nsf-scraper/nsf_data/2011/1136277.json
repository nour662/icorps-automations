 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Education is committed to doubling the number of STEM teacher candidates by 2013.  In support of this goal, the Noyce Scholars Program is attracting and preparing a talented, diverse cohort of University of Maryland (UM) students to effectively teach mathematics in high needs middle and high schools. In an effort to increase freshman and sophomore interest in teaching mathematics, program activities include employing freshman and sophomores as tutors in local middle schools and providing freshman and sophomore summer internships with a focus on mathematics teaching and learning. Noyce Scholars receive scholarships, engage in preparation specific to high needs contexts, and, in their final year, are being placed in year-long internships in high needs schools with highly effective mentor teachers. Prince George's County Public Schools serves as district partner for this effort. During employment in their first two years, Noyce Scholars are being supported through an induction program consisting of collaborative, online study of Noyce Scholars' records of practice and virtual mentoring. The project is expected to produce a total of 32 teachers from both the undergraduate math degree with secondary certification and  the integrated masters programs. \r\n\r\nThe UM Noyce Scholars Program builds on program development work in mathematics teacher education and it enhances the infrastructure for mathematics teacher education at UM. The program adds to UM's ability to recruit, prepare, diversify, and support secondary mathematics teachers in the State of Maryland and beyond.",

The UMD Noyce Scholars Program consisted of four components:\n1. Tutoring experiences for UMD freshmen and sophomores in local middle and high schools.\n2. Summer internship experiences for UMD freshmen and sophomores in organizations and institutions focused on mathematics teaching and learning.\n3. Scholarships for UMD students pursuing certification in secondary mathematics.\n4. Induction experiences for UMD Noyce Scholar alumni employed as secondary mathematics teachers in high-needs schools. \n\nThe purpose of the tutoring and summer internship components of the UMD Noyce Scholars Program was to expose UMD freshmen and sophomores to the mathematics teaching profession and positively influence their interest in pursuing a mathematics teaching career in high-needs schools.  UM Noyce Tutors worked in two middle schools and one high school in Prince George?s County Public Schools. UMD Noyce Interns were employed during the summers in a variety of institutions and organizations focused on mathematics teaching and learning.  UMD Noyce Interns engaged in a wide range of mathematics teaching related opportunities, including serving as instructional technology developers (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics), mathematics camp counselors (UMD Mathletics Camp), and mathematics assessment developers (Montgomery County Public Schools).\n\nOver the program period, 32 UMD students were awarded 44 $14,000 scholarships (12 students received 2 years of support) to support their pursuit of becoming a secondary mathematics teacher through completion of the UM mathematics education program.  The UMD mathematics education program is a nationally-ranked, rigorous education preparation program requiring students to double major in mathematics and mathematics education.  UMD Noyce Scholars were supported on their path towards certification in secondary mathematics through multiple means, including monthly topical seminars related to mathematics teaching in high-needs schools, conference attendance, and provision of instructional resources for their first year of teaching.  Furthermore, UMD Noyce Program administration and staff organized and facilitated induction activities for UMD Noyce Scholars after graduation as they transitioned to full time employment as secondary mathematics teachers.\n\nDesign and facilitation of the UMD Noyce Scholars Program allowed program staff to explore and learn about the power of providing freshmen and sophomores opportunities to serve as tutors in real secondary classrooms with real secondary students.  The tutoring component of the UMD Noyce Scholars Program served as a promising recruitment practice in our efforts to attract undergraduates to the teaching profession.  The UMD Noyce Scholars Program also deepened and expanded our knowledge of the importance of induction experiences for new teachers and challenged us to think about delivering induction support in innovative ways.\n\nThe UMD Noyce Scholars Program also provided UMD to consider how to coordinate resources within and beyond the campus borders.  In that the UMD Noyce Scholars Program involved multiple UMD colleges, local school districts, organizations, and institutions, the positive effects of the UMD Noyce Scholars Program went beyond benefit to the scholarship recipients.  Through the UMD Noyce Scholars Program, UMD has been given the opportunity to impact the local and regional area by developing cohorts of well-prepared mathematics teachers for the responsibilities of teaching in high needs schools, cultivate partnerships between UMD and local school districts, and establish new relationships with institutions and organizations focused on improving mathematics teaching and learning.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lawrence M Clark"
