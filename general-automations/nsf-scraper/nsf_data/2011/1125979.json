The International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2011) will be held in Taipei, Taiwan, May 2-6, 2011. All students awarded stipends will participate in a Doctoral Mentoring Consortium in which they will present their research to other student researchers and receive in-depth feedback from a group of senior researchers. Travel stipends will be awarded through an application process that requires that students be full-time students and that they be explicitly listed as an author of an accepted paper. The AAMAS conference provides these students with a platform to present their research results and allows them to participate in valuable discussions that will likely shape the future of this critically important field. The technical program is complemented with an array of workshops, tutorials and other events. The wide variety and significance of the topics typically presented at AAMAS, in both the technical program and the workshop program, provides opportunities for students to share, exchange and learn from each other.",
