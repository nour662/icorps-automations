 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is studying the impact of the mathematics and science intensive pre-service preparation program for elementary school teachers at North Carolina State University called the Accomplished Elementary Teachers of Mathematics and Science (ATOMS). Faculty in NCSU's Department of Elementary Education, researchers at the Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy's Education Research Data Center and the NC State College Professional Education Office are involved in conducting this project.\r\n\r\nThe project includes assessments of pre-service teachers' math and science content, teacher performance, self-report surveys, and teacher interviews. Researchers are also tracking participants' perspectives on the program and comparing knowledge dimensions and teaching performance of a sub-sample of ATOMS teachers to a similar group of non-ATOMS teachers. Each of the study dimensions (Knowledge Dimension, Teaching Performance, and Perspectives on the Program) will be assessed at three time points across this longitudinal study, providing a model for elementary teacher development of STEM teaching.\r\n\r\nThe study has potential to advance current understanding regarding teacher preparation, especially in terms of supporting elementary teachers' instruction in science and math. The project is also innovative and potentially transformative by asking interesting and pertinent questions of how teachers can affect the learning of their students. Besides generating new knowledge, this project also has the potential to impact STEM education research. The ATOMS pre-service teacher preparation program may serve as a model for effective pre-service teacher education across the nation if the researchers can clearly demonstrate the effect of participating in the program in changing teachers' knowledge, attitudes, and skills, as well as their students' achievement. Investigators propose the dissemination of findings to both K-12 audiences and institutions of higher education. Additionally, key findings will be bulleted for policy makers in brief reports or brochures sent to deans of Colleges of Education nationwide, highlighting recommendations based on the findings.",

Specifically, the project examined their knowledge, beliefs, and instructional practices in mathematics and science from the time they entered their preservice TPP until they completed their second year of teaching (See Figure 1).&nbsp; Here, we refer to these teachers as \"novice teachers\" since they were early in their development.&nbsp; To understand the development of the novice teachers over time and their characteristics as first and second-year teachers, the Project ATOMS study included a developmental component and a comparative component.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Developmental Component:&nbsp; The novice teachers participating in the developmental component of the study included 235 novice teachers in the STEM-focused TPP.&nbsp; As displayed in Figure 2, these participants were followed between three to five years depending upon where they were in the program when Project ATOMS began.&nbsp; Of these 235 participants, there were 19 case-study participants from the same cohort who were followed in depth for three years (noted in yellow on Figure 2).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Comparative Component:&nbsp; There were 171 novice teachers who participated in the comparative component of the study, 56 who completed the STEM-focused TPP and 115 who completed other TPPs (noted in green in Figure 2).&nbsp; These participants completed surveys of their knowledge and beliefs at the end of their first and second years of teaching.&nbsp; Additionally, analyses included a comparison of student achievement outcomes in the classrooms of the two groups of teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of the 171 novice teachers, 145 provided information about their instructional practices in two ways during their second year of teaching (n=45 teachers from STEM-focused TPP; 96 teachers from other TPPs).&nbsp; First, they completed lesson logs using the Instructional Practices Log in Mathematics (IPL-M) and the Instructional Practices Log in Science (IPL-S) for 45 days across the school year at three 15-day timepoints.&nbsp; Second, they submitted video-recordings of three mathematics lessons and three science lessons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Findings:&nbsp; We collected a comprehensive set of data on novice teachers' knowledge, beliefs, instructional practices, and the achievement of elementary students in their classrooms.&nbsp; Here, we highlight only two key findings from each component of the study.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Developmental Finding #1:&nbsp; We tracked all developmental participants' efficacy to teach mathematics and science over time.&nbsp; As hypothesized, their confidence increased throughout the program, but once they entered their career, their confidence to teach mathematics and science either became stable or encountered a decrease.&nbsp; While these findings are similar to other researchers, we found that obstacles and challenges during the first year of teaching (e.g., classroom management, navigating the demands of paperwork) could explain these changes in the confidence of novice teachers who had completed a TPP that was more mathemaitcs and science intensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Developmental Finding #2:&nbsp; We tracked a sub-sample of the novice teachers' evolving visions of high-quality mathematics anc science instruction.&nbsp; Overall, the participants' visions became more aligned with high-quality instruction over time.&nbsp; In the case of science, we found three factors that contributed to their visions: their memories of elementary school science as children, the STEM-focused teacher preparation program, and school or district policies related to science instruction.&nbsp; In the case of mathematics, we noted obstacles (e.g., classroom management) and affordances (e.g., colleagues who had aligned vision) that seemed to influence their evolving visions as they entered their teaching career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Comparative Finding #1: We found some differences in knowledge and beliefs between the participants who completed the STEM-focused program and those who completed other programs.&nbsp; Perhaps, taking more science content and methods courses in the STEM-focused program explains why the graduates of that program felt more confident in their abilities to impact the outcomes of their students in science.&nbsp; Additionally, the graduates of the STEM-focused program demonstrated a deeper understanding of the specialized knowledge required to teach mathematics in the elementary grades, again perhaps due to the mathematics-intensive nature of their program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Comparative Finding #2:&nbsp; Participants who had completed the STEM-focused program implemented instruction that included more opportunities to engage in talk about mathematics.&nbsp; This was evident in two data sources.&nbsp; First, the participants from the STEM-focused program gave their students more opportuniteis to engage in mathematical talk as indicated by the daily logs about their mathematics lessons on the IPL-M.&nbsp; Second, their video-recorded lessons indicated higher quality mathematical discourse, explanation, and justification among students, as indicated by the Mathematics Scan (M-Scan).&nbsp; Perhaps, the opportunities throughout the TPP to engage in mathematics content and pedagoy acorss multiple courses explains these differences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, the results of Project ATOMS indicates that teacher preparation programs matter in the development of novice teachers' knowledge, beliefs, and instructional practices.&nbsp;
