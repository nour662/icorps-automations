 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will conduct the first comprehensive demographic study of solar and space physics and related scientific disciplines. This includes scientists who investigate: 1) the Sun; 2) the nature of the region of space affected by our sun; and 3) the response of Earth and the rest of our solar system to this space environment.  The disciplinary areas in which these scientists operate include: solar physics, space physics, magnetospheric physics, aeronomy, and upper atmospheric physics.  The project is a collaboration between the co-chairs of the Education & Workforce working group associated with the ongoing National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey in Solar and Space Physics with the American Institute of Physics (AIP).  The objective of the project is to assess the demographic health of these tightly coupled areas of scientific endeavor.",
