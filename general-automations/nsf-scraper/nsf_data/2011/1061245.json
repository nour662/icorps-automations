 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to examine the role of religious interpretation in shaping political behavior.  Building on preliminary results, this project aims to evaluate how the multiple dimensions of religious belief generate convergence and divergence on political values, opion, and partisanship.  By better understanding what people believe their religious calls them to do, we can better understand how religion influences political behavior.\r\n\r\nScholars of American society and politics have long noted the importance of religion and have made strides to properly capture it by focusing on three key dimensions: belonging, behaving, and believing.  The most robust of these dimensions has been beliefs.  However, several studies have shown that individual characteristics mitigate the impact of beliefs.  This study will allow for these differences to be examined more closely than has been the case previously.  The specific goal of this pilot study is to establish valid and reliable measures of the different dimensions. This will be done by implementing a national survey which will allow scholars to examine the extent to which ordinary citizens adhere to various religious interpretations.  \r\n\r\nThe research generated by this project will appeal to scholars interested in religion and politics, political communication, and American political behavior.  Beyond academia, the findings from this research can help us better understand the variety of ways that religion intersects with American culture.",
