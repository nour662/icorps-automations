 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University System of Maryland (USM) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) will\r\nbuild upon its success of training and educating Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Fellows by proposing\r\na program for a sixth cohort. The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) is the lead institution\r\nof a senior-level LSAMP and has been designated as the BD site for 2011-2013. UMBC is dedicated to\r\nrecruiting, retaining, educating, and training underrepresented students in science, technology,\r\nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, and preparing them for success in the STEM workforce.\r\nUMBC welcomed its first cohort of BD Fellows in 2005. Three of those Fellows completed Ph.D.s during\r\n2010-2011. Others from that cohort are persisting in doctoral programs (full-time and part-time) or have\r\nreceived M.S. degrees and remain in touch with UMBC's BD Program as they plan to return for the\r\ndoctorate. (One 2005 BD Fellow is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Utah, and another will begin the\r\nD.Eng. program at Morgan State University in fall 2011.) The USM has four additional cohorts of fellows\r\non both the UMBC and the University of Maryland, College Park campuses. The Fellows connect with\r\none another at BD training, professional development, and community building events. The USM LSAMP\r\nbegan in 1995 and has been vigilant about increasing the number of underrepresented minority\r\nbaccalaureate degree recipients in STEM disciplines. The BD award will enable us to strengthen both our\r\nundergraduate and graduate pipelines and create an expanded community of scholars within these\r\ndisciplines.\r\nPlans for the 2011-2013 cohort include activities that will begin during the fellows' first week on campus.\r\nThe program includes extensive orientation activities such as a 2-day Summer Success Institute, the\r\nGraduate School Orientation, and multi-day orientations with faculty within the STEM departments. In the\r\nfirst year, the Fellows will be assigned a Peer Mentor; apply for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship;\r\nreceive training in public speaking; and complete a 30-50 page research preparation project that will\r\nrequire them to network with other graduate students, faculty, and BD Fellows at universities outside of\r\nthe USM. Throughout the two years, BD Fellows will participate in bi-weekly BD meetings, attend\r\nmonthly Graduate Student Success Seminars, and participate in academic and professional development\r\nseminars with other graduate students and faculty. By the end of the second year, the BD Fellows will\r\nhave learned and implemented methodologies for achieving academic excellence, completed credits for\r\nthe M.S. degree or early qualifying milestones toward the doctorate (varies according to department),\r\ncompleted 10 hours of UMBC's \"Professors-in-Training\" modules, presented at two research conferences,\r\nparticipated in numerous networking opportunities with faculty, attended workshops on thesis completion\r\nand dissertation proposal planning, and developed a plan for persisting to finish the doctorate.",
