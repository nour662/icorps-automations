 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative research project is to design an effective system for managing smart grids and smart meters for electricity production and consumption, with the eventual goal of helping creating a sustainable energy future.  The scope of this research plan encompasses the robust management of smart grids, adaptive usage controls based on real-time information provided by smart meters, and the development of an effective mechanism for coordinating supply and demands.   Smart grids refer to a new and intelligent network of electricity production facilities, transmission grids, equipped with automation software and control systems for delivering and monitoring electricity to meet the demands.  Smart meters are a vital part of the smart grids technology.   These meters are equipped with intelligent sensors that track the real-time consumption of energy, enabling users to monitor their electrical usage during peak versus off-peak hours. \r\n\r\nAlgorithms and systems for making the smart grids more robust, and are able to withstand shocks within the systems will be developed.  There will also be a focus on developing a policy for controlling energy consumption in real-time based on the information provided by the smart meters. If successful, the project will facilitate the realization of smart grid's potential by developing the necessary optimization methods, control policies, and data analysis techniques for the management of smart grids and smart meters. The results of the research will be included in the curriculum of the Master of Engineering Program in Energy Markets and Risk by the IEOR Department at UC Berkeley.  The research will be translated into teaching modules that can be used for Master's students in this program.  Establishment of close collaborative relationships with companies in the energy industry and DOE national labs are planned.",
