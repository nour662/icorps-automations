 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Moravian College Scholars in Mathematics and Computer Science Program provides scholarships to community college students who transfer to Moravian College to complete a bachelor's degree in mathematics or computer science. Students are awarded scholarships for two years and, if necessary, for a fifth semester at Moravian.  The objectives of this program are: 1) to provide opportunities for area community college students who otherwise would not be able to afford a private liberal arts college education to attend Moravian College, 2) to enhance existing and build new bonds between Moravian College and community colleges in the area, 3) to broaden participation of community college transfer students in mathematics and computer science at Moravian College and 4) to increase the number of community college transfer students who graduate from Moravian College with a degree in mathematics and computer science.\r\n\r\nThis project eases the difficulties of transfer students by providing orientation, a summer bridge program, and opportunities to engage in research projects culminating in a conference for K-12 students. This project will have a sustained impact on Moravian College as well as the Lehigh Valley via the service-learning aspects of the summer program which exposes area K-12 students to interesting aspects of mathematics and computer science, raising awareness of STEM field opportunities. Relationships between community colleges and Moravian College will be strengthened and opportunities for future STEM student placement are enhanced.",
