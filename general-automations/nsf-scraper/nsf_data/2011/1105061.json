In the course of these operations, energy resources are consumed and the usefulness of materials resources is altered. As the world-wide demand for energy continues to rise and the economic and environmental impact of fossil fuel combustion continues to be felt, the search for suitable alternative energy sources has become more urgent than ever. Among the various renewable energy sources, the conversion of sunlight directly into electricity using the photovoltaic (PV) properties of certain materials is attractive.  Current PV manufacturing practices suffer from poor energy efficiency and large carbon footprints due to poor material utilization, high processing temperatures and/or high solvent usage -- offsetting the hope and promise of PV technologies. The objective of this project is to explore the possibility of a zero energy impact chemical manufacturing process for the production of nanoscale solar energy materials.\r\n\r\nRecent advances in nanocrystals are having a dramatic impact on the development of next generation low-cost and/or high efficiency solar cells. For example, semiconductor nanocrystal inks are used to lower the fabrication cost of the absorber layers of the solar cells. In addition, some quantum confined nanocrystals display an electron-hole pair generation phenomena with greater than 100% quantum yield, called multiple exciton generation. These quantum dots could potentially be used to fabricate solar cells that exceed the Schockley-Queisser limit. This project aims to investigate the microreactor systems powered by renewable energy for the production of nanoscale solar energy materials. The needed thermal energy for driving the chemical reaction will be supplied via a parabolic trough solar concentrator. Two different reactor schemes will be investigated in this EAGER project. One is the direct use of solar radiation onto solar microchannel reactors and the other approach is to use an energy transfer medium to absorb the solar energy then use the medium as an energy input for the synthesis. The idea of using a solar microreactor for the production of nanoscale solar energy materials will be explored for the first time through this EAGER project to assess its feasibility and to identify the key challenges.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nPV manufacturing industry and green building construction industry are expected to grow significantly due to the increasing awareness of renewable energy and government incentives. The current low adoption of solar based energy generation can be attributed to inefficiency and high cost. An inherent cost to the current technology is the high consumption of energy in the solar energy materials production processes. The possibility of achieving zero-energy impact manufacturing processes in a cost-effective manner can make solar energy technologies greener and more affordable. The demonstrations of this solar micro-reaction technology will increase effectiveness and efficiency, reduce cost of nanoscale solar energy materials and in turn lead to wider adoption. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in this project and mini projects for the existing K-12 outreach programs on the OSU campus will be developed for recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups (young women and ethnic minorities) into science and engineering.",

This project has provided research opportunities for the training of one postdoctoral scholar, two PhD students and one high school student. This team has developed novel processes and materials that could lead to a more sustainable future.   \n \nAs a result of this project the group at the Oregon State University has demonstrated a novel process for the synthesis of CuInSe2 (CIS) nanoparticles using a continuous-flow solar micro-reactor. This novel reactor design allows for rapid heating and very fast reaction times using the energy input from a simulated solar radiation. Both chalcopyrite and sphalerite CIS nanoparticles with uniform-size distributions could be synthesized by varying the reaction temperature and flow rates using this solar micro-reactor. This work clearly demonstrated a path to synthesize nanoscale solar energy materials using the renewable solar energy directly.    \n \nCIS semiconductor materials have been extensively studied as candidates for thin-film absorber layers in high efficiency solar cells. Most traditional CIS thin film production methods are relatively expensive and often times require vacuum systems. For this reason, there has been a good deal of research work done on solution based synthesis of CIS nanoparticle suspensions that can be easily and inexpensively deposited or printed into thin-film configurations. Most of these solution based processes are batch methods that require inert environments and very long synthesis times at elevated temperatures. The batch methods, while ideal for laboratory scale work, do not lend themselves well to larger scale production which is necessary for commercialization. This newly developed solar micro-reactor could provide a convenient means to increase production rates and production volumes with minimal energy consumption. \n \nAnother key outcome of this project is the development of a detailed model for the photochemical deposition process of copper sulfide thin films. Cupper sulfide is an important component for thin film solar cells. Photochemical deposition is another processing technique that could potentially use sunlight as an energy input directly. The model is based on a reaction mechanism suggested by the experimental data. Reaction rate constants were successfully estimated from the experimental data using this model. The calculated results agree well with the experimental data. This model will serve as a useful tool for the control and optimization of photochemical deposition of copper sulfide thin films in the future.\n \nThe third outcome of this project is a highly active p-type Na:ZnO photocatalyst that was synthesized using a continuous flow microreactor. SEM and TEM images of Na:ZnO photocatalyst show that the Na:ZnO morphology adopts a flower-like structure. This synthesis method also allows for the incorporation of Na into ZnO structure, which resulted in a material with superior photocatalytic activity that is visible-light-sensitive. The as synthesized material substantially outperformed commercially available P-25 TiO2 in the photocatalytic degradation of dye under simulated solar irradiation. The abundant def..."
