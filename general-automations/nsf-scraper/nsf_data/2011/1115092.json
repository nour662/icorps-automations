The conference will address the current state of large-scale, complex computational models of the coupled upper atmosphere as well as future modeling needs of the ionosphere/thermosphere (IT) research community.   Specific objectives of the conference are to provide the IT community, including its student members, with the following:\r\n\t-\tan overview of existing IT models\r\n\t-\texamples of model applications\r\n\t-\tdata/model comparisons\r\n\t-\tassessment of model strengths and weaknesses\r\n\t-\tidentification of future efforts to improve IT modeling capabilities",
