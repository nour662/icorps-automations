The center focuses on improving the management of the software engineering process, the productivity of software engineers, and the security, quality and timeliness of software engineering products. \r\n\r\nVirginia Tech (VT) requests funding for becoming a third site of the NSF Center for Security and Software Engineering Center (S2ERC) under the leadership of Professor T. Charles Clancy. The addition of Virginia Tech faculty and from the National Capital Region will promote S2ERC reputation as the premier I/UCRC in two research areas critical to the country, namely software engineering and security. The seventeen VT faculty who are planning to participate in the S2ERC will increase the Center's research capabilities in areas such as software/system security, hardware and embedded system security, wireless network and spectrum security, enterprise and internet security, modeling and simulation of dynamic cyber systems, and cyber law, policy and business. While some of these research areas represent new capabilities in the S2ERC, others will strengthen current expertise in the Center. \r\n\r\nThe addition of Virginia Tech to S2ERC will enable the existing center to access the broad array of Northern Virginia companies focused in this area. The combination of location and current federal research strategy will allow this center to be at the nexus of an extremely important research topic and one that industry is highly interested in cutting edge research results. Additionally, Virginia Tech has an international footprint, operating in five countries. VT plans to have an extremely diverse pool of students and faculty involved in the center. Students will benefit from laboratory work and interaction with NSA and other agencies in Northern Virginia along with coursework in cyber security.",
