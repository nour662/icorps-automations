 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants from around the world vary considerably in their leaf morphological and physiological traits.  Although some combinations of leaf traits are found repeatedly in nature, others are not.  This suggests either that the observed trait combinations are economically advantageous for carbon gain and plant productivity in different habitats, and thus reflect adaptive evolution, or that these are the only trait combinations that are genetically possible. The project will test whether trait combinations identified as the Worldwide Leaf Economic Spectrum (WLES: leaf photosynthesis, nitrogen, thickness, and lifespan) reflect successful ecological and evolutionary solutions to different environments.  First, the project will compare 27 species of sunflower species (Helianthus), to see whether particular trait combinations are robust when evolutionary relationships are accounted for, and whether they are associated with success in particular environments, and thus support adaptive evolution.  Second, the project will test whether artificial selection under low nutrients results in trait combinations predicted by the WLES, and whether there are any genetic constraints.  The expectation is that many trait combinations are possible (i.e. no genetic constraints) and that the WLES trait combinations found in nature and managed systems represent plant strategies that are the most successful compromises between rapid resource acquisition and greater resource conservation for different environments.   A greater understanding of WLES leaf traits and their association with success in low resource habitats may contribute to the improvement of domesticated Helianthus annuus, which is a major oilseed crop with over 2 million acres in cultivation in the US.  The results will also further the ability to predict which plants will be successful in natural and managed habitats as climates change.  The study will provide unique training for high school students and future science teachers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere are patterns of leaf traits that usually occur together when looking at many different plant species from across the globe.  Leaves with \"faster\" metabolic rates (higher photosynthesis, respiration) usually contain higher nutrient levels (nitrogen and phosphorus) and are structurally thinner (lower leaf mass per areas) with a shorter lifespan, whereas leaves with \"slower\" metabolic rates usually contain lower nutrient levels are thicker and longer lived.  This spectrum of leaf trait combinations is called the \"Worldwide Leaf Economic Spectrum (LES).  It has been hypothesized that this spectrum results from natural selection, plants with \"faster\" leaf traits perform better in some environments and plants with \"slower\" traits perform better in different environments, and from universal biophysical constraints that prevent some trait combinations from occurring.  To test these hypotheses, we compared 28 species (83 populations) of wild sunflowers (Helianthus) for LES leaf traits in greenhouse studies where plants were all grown under similar environmental conditions in order to reveal genetically based differences.  When the trait data were analyzed to take into consideration the degree of species relatedness, which we determined based on the similarity of 170 genes, we found that most of the expected correlations among LES traits were observed. This provides robust evidence for correlated evolution of these traits.  However, leaf mass per area was not correlated with leaf lifetime, indicating that this may not be a universal tradeoff or constraint.  When we look at the characteristics of the habitats where these species grow naturally, we found that \"faster\" leaf traits were generally associated with drier and higher fertility habitats and \"slower\" leaf traits were generally associated with wetter and lower fertility habitats.  This is evidence that the LES patterns are due, in part, to natural selection.  We additionally measured stem and root traits for these species and found evidence for correlated evolution among stem traits, and between stem and leaf traits, supporting the of coordination of resource use traits across organs.  This pattern was less clear for root resource use traits than stem and leaf traits.\n\nIn additional to publications, this research generated a Helianthus phylogeny as a resource for the evolutionary ecology community, and publicly available plant trait and genetic data sets for ~ 27 species of Helianthus.\n\nThe results from this research have broad implications for plant breeding.  If there are fundamental tradeoffs in plant leaf traits, then it may not be possible to artificially select for some traits combinations.  However, the variation observed with wild Helianthus suggests that it may be possible to decouple some traits, making it possible to breed for some traits that contribute to stress resistance while maximizing growth/yield potential. An additional broader impact of the research was training of 11 graduate students, 38 undergraduate students, and 4 high school students for future careers in the science research and education.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lisa A Donovan"
