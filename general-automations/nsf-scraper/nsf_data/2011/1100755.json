This workshop will be partially sponsored by the Swiss host institutions ETH and EAWAG.  The workshop will address issues of research & education arising from the interface of nanotechnology and water engineering in a meaningful and focused dialogue, and provide valuable mentorship and international networking opportunities to emerging leaders and young researchers in this rapidly growing field through an integrated experience.  The funding requested from NSF would be used to subsidize travel by US researchers especially junior faculty and postdocs, who would greatly benefit from this unique opportunity to share knowledge and technologies in this emerging field and identify research priorities.  Topics to discuss include:  (1) Nanosorbents; (2) Nanocatalysts, bio and redox -active NP; (3) Dendritic polymers / Biopolymers; (4) Multifunctional membranes (including nanostructured membranes); (5) Sensors / Monitoring systems; and (6) Safety Issues.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts will result from the active engagement of the workshop?s participants.  This engagement will undoubtedly enhance and strengthen the opportunities for and interest in international, interdisciplinary as well as academic-industrial collaboration on environmental applications of nanomaterials.  In addition, the workshop will provide a solid foundation for the academic community?s future: (a) involvement in supporting and furthering CBET?s vision, mission, and goals; and (b) collaboration in research and education programs, projects, and activities at greater and closer levels.  Thus, this workshop will not only help participants to craft better proposals and compete more effectively, but it will also contribute to the overall development of young faculty members.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "IWA Specialist Conference\nApplications of Nanotechnology in the Water Sector\nMay 15-18, 2011\nCentro Stefano Franscini, Monte Verita, Ascona Switzerland\nhttp://www.iwanano2011.org/presentations.html\nProject Outcome Report\nPrepared by: Jon Brame \nRice University Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n\n\nConference Overview\nThe International Water Association (IWA) hosted a three-day conference on the applications of nanotechnology in the water sector.  Water quality, availability, treatment and usage will be a global concern in the next century, as access to clean, safe water is already an issue for large parts of the world, and has been included by the United Nations as one of the Millennium Development Goals.  The ability to access, treat, consume and reuse water will require increased technological innovations as demand, availability and contamination increase.\n\nNanotechnology has emerged as an exciting area of research due to the intriguing and unique properties which many materials display at small scales.  Yet despite decades of exciting findings at small scales, relatively few large-scale applications are fully \"nano\" driven.  Furthermore, as nano-enhanced products and materials continue to increase in various industries and markets the opportunity for nano contamination of water supplies will continue to grow.  Since the water sector has much to gain from potential nano applications and much to prepare for from potential nano implications, the nexus of nanotechnology and water research is an exciting area of study, as demonstrated by the insightful variety of presentations at this conference.\nThe goals of the conference, as set out by Jan Hoffman (one of the conference organizers) were to:\n1.     Exchange information between scientists and engineers working in the field;\n2.    Take the information from the group and disseminate it to the public to aide in public perception of nanotechnology as a viable water treatment technique;\n3.    Stimulate technology development through exchange of ideas and information and;\n4.    Be the eyes and ears for bringing developing nanotechnologies into the water sector.\nOne of the main points of these goals was to acknowledge the fact that many of those in attendance are active in other fields, and by increasing awareness of the potential as well as the barriers in nano-aided water treatment, this group can be ambassadors to and from a much larger audience than just this conference.  These goals were put into action immediately, as experience from various groups coincided and collaborations were formed throughout the conference.\nThemes established throughout the conference that will play a critical role in the future direction of the field included increasing technological and economical viability, determining energy and material footprints and release implications through life-cycle assessment, controlling chemistry at the nano level, enabling nano materials to have macro effects, finding ways to combine effects/materials to increase efficiency and conducting more groundbreaking vs. incremental research.\nNano research must broaden the focus on competitive application.  Cost analysis is an essential part of emerging technology and many promising technologies are impractical due to prohibitive material and implementation costs.  Pedro Alvarez from Rice University described how the price of materials rises exponentially with purity: sometimes we can accomplish the same goal with less purified materials, thus drastically reducing the cost.  Mamadou Diallo from KAIST suggested that in order to break into current markets, new technologies must be twice as effective as the status quo. \nThe other alternative is to find a niche where there is no current technology, or where the demand is high.  Treating emerging contaminants, or highly contaminated water (such as acid mine drainage) could fit that gap. \nWith any new technology it is important to understand the associated implications.  ..."
