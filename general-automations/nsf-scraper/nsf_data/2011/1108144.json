Though the region covers only 0.2% of China's land area, it contains 16% of China\u00c6s plant diversity with more than 5000 plant species.4 However, Xishuangbanna\u00c6s rainforests are disappearing at alarming rates due to the proliferation of rubber plantations.5 Natural forest cover dropped from 60% to 27% from the 1950s to 1990s, leading to significant losses of habitat for many species.6 Outside nature reserves, holy hills are often the only fragments of natural forests remaining and have been documented containing endangered species from China\u00c6s Plant Red Data List.7\n\nThis project investigates the conservation potential of holy hills in Xishuangbanna through a three-part analysis of: 1) plant species richness, 2) land cover change, and 3) local culture. It is crucial to maintain an interdisciplinary perspective when studying holy hills. Because they are cultural relics without government protection, their existence and persistence is entirely dependent on local people and how they maintain their traditions. Thus, this project asks:\n\n1)    Do holy hills shelter species during agricultural expansion? Are they species refugia?\n\n2)    Are holy hills shrinking and/or being increasingly isolated by surrounding deforestation?\n\n3)    How are the local people responding to economic development? Under what circumstances will holy hills continue to be respected and protected?\n\n \n\nResearch Design \n\nTrees, shrubs, and herbaceous species in holy hills, surrounding rubber plantations, and nature reserves were surveyed in 10m&times;10m, 2m&times;2m, and 1m&times;1m plots, respectively, in conjunction with botanists from Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG).\n\nI located ten holy hills, mapped their borders, and used Landsat satellite images to classify surrounding land cover in ENVI.

I also saw variation in the degrees to which holy hills are shrinking and isolated, which could have varying effects on shifting floristic composition towards pioneer species. It is unclear how cultural changes in the Dai people will affect the species protection currently provided by holy hills, but it seems that dominant factors governing this change include the rubber economy, isolation from economic centers, and political history (e.g. effects of the Cultural Revolution).\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nLow-lying forest types contain the highest biodiversity but are also most at risk from development because rubber trees are more productive at lower altitudes.9 Found at low elevations, Dai holy hills..."
