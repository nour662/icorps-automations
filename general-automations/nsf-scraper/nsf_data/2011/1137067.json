W. Marriott\r\nResort, Las Vegas, Nevada, May 31 to June 3, 2011. In the fields of nanofabrication,\r\nelectron and ion-beam lithographies, photon and imprint lithographies, particle-beam\r\noptics, and forefront applications of nanofabrication, this conference is preeminent. The\r\nrequested travel aid will enable students to present their research to a high level\r\ninternational scientific community. They will observe how scientists and engineers\r\nexchange innovative ideas and other information at conferences, and they?ll hear firsthand\r\npresentations of up-to-date research results in nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nLearning how a technical conference serves as a venue for conveying information to\r\nother is an important element of a student?s education. Also important is leaning how to\r\npresent, in a cogent and understandable way, the results of one?s research. The requested\r\nsupport will help to accomplish these ends. At the conference, students will make\r\nimportant personal contacts and learn of employment opportunities. At a special breakfast\r\nfor the funded students, the conference organizers will discuss optimal techniques for\r\npresenting scientific information and how the conference program is put together.",
