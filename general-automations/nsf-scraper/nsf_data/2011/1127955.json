DHH students face barriers to a successful STEM education: 1) insufficient preparation and background information; 2) lack of role models and peer socialization with those who are both DHH and have mutual STEM interests; and, 3) lack of access to information about STEM innovations. The project addressed these barriers, creating an online infrastructure enabling tutoring, mentoring, and information sharing about STEM innovations. 70 DHH postsecondary students enrolled from three Northeast campuses: a two-year school (Camden County College, Blackwell, NJ, n=8), a master?s-level university (Rochester Institute of Technology?RIT, Rochester, NY, n=58), and a doctoral-level, Ivy League university (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, n=4). RIT was the lead campus. The <em>goal</em> of the project was to establish a model for a Virtual Academic Community (VAC) that will increase graduation rates of DHH STEM majors in postsecondary education in the long term. Two <em>objectives</em> support the goal: (1) documenting and disseminating a description of the process of creating the VAC in order to create a scalable model that can be replicated to fit the needs of other students with disabilities in STEM majors; and, (2) increasing the GPAs and retention rates of D/HH students in STEM majors.</p>\n<p><strong>Activities and Accomplishments</strong></p>\n<p><em>Establish a model Virtual Academic Community (VAC)</em>. The project created a website, (<a href=\"http://dhhvac.org\">http://dhhvac.org</a>) viewed 11,978 times. The website includes STEM and DHH-related resources, such as STEM terminology dictionaries in American Sign Language (ASL), project presentations and a project manual. A YouTube channel was also created, (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/dhhvac\">https://www.youtube.com/user/dhhvac</a>), with 19,880 views.</p>\n<p><em>Document and disseminate a description of the VAC</em>.

Faculty/graduate students with both content knowledge and communication skills created online synchronous and asynchronous tutoring with students. 174, 60-minute-average length synchronous sessions were held with Google Hangouts or Zoom. Faculty created 474 asynchronous videos for developmental mathematics courses that were captioned, signed in ASL by the instructor, and often displayed the TI graphing calculator. The videos were viewed 3,848 times. Additionally, a biochemistry/chemistry instructor created 13 videos reviewing general chemistry problems. These videos are now used in an RIT-funded research project. Data collection continues.</p>\n<p><em>Role models and peer socialization</em>. DHH students lack DHH STEM professionals as role models and experience isolation from others with common STEM interests. Twenty-one DHH STEM professionals were recruited as mentors. Mentors and students were paired for career interests and, in part, by communication preference. The mentors communicated with their mentees approximately 81 times through email, text, and videophone (e.g., FaceTime). Project members socialized through private Google+ (Currents) and Facebook platforms with community-building posts (e.g., birthdays, achievements) and accessible STEM content. Mentors contributed 199 posts, 431 comments, and 1,082 responses. Students made 314 posts, 408 comments, 521reactions, and 5,903 views.</p>\n<p><em>Providing accessible information about STEM innovations</em>. Monday-Friday, project staff communicated STEM information using the project social media pages. This included 1,112 on STEM topics posts and 4,282 engagement reactions (e.g., comments, +1s, likes, etc.). by non-staff project members.</p>\n<p><em>Increase the GPAs and retention rates of DHH students in STEM majors</em>. Student participation, grade point average (GPA), and graduation were tracked annually. <em>Each year, students surpassed the target GPAs for their campuses, with the exception of &nbsp;Cornell</em> <em>undergraduates.</em></p>\n<p><em>Retention to degree</em>. Out of 70 students enrolled in the project, 7 are currently enrolled (3 PhD, 2 master?s, and 2 bachelor?s degree programs) and 62 students graduated (13 associates, 2 certificates, 45 bachelor?s, 2 master?s) for a graduation rate of 89%. In comparison, only 18.8% of deaf adults complete a bachelor?s degree or more (Garberoglio, Palmer, Cawthon, &amp; Sales, 2019).</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>\n<p>DHH students engaged with different STEM-focused activities through our virtual academic community, suggesting the diversity of support structures was key. Further, our project participants graduated at a rate of 70% higher than the national average.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:

The videos were viewed 3,848 times. Additionally, a biochemistry/chemistry instructor created 13 videos reviewing general chemistry problems. These videos are now used in an RIT-funded research project. Data collection continues.\n\nRole models and peer socialization. DHH students lack DHH STEM professionals as role models and experience isolation from others with common STEM interests. Twenty-one DHH STEM professionals were recruited as mentors. Mentors and students were paired for career interests and, in part, by communication preference. The mentors communicated with their mentees approximately 81 times through email, text, and videophone (e.g., FaceTime). Project members socialized through private Google+ (Currents) and Facebook platforms with community-building posts (e.g., birthdays, achievements) and accessible STEM content. Mentors contributed 199 posts, 431 comments, and 1,082 responses. Students made 314 posts, 408 comments, 521reactions, and 5,903 views.\n\nProviding accessible information about STEM innovations. Monday-Friday, project staff communicated STEM information using the project social media pages. This included 1,112 on STEM topics posts and 4,282 engagement reactions (e.g., comments, +1s, likes, etc.). by non-staff project members.\n\nIncrease the GPAs and retention rates of DHH students in STEM majors. Student participation, grade point average (GPA), and graduation were tracked annually. Each year, students surpassed the target GPAs for their campuses, with the exception of  Cornell undergraduates.\n\nRetention to degree. Out of 70 students enrolled in the project, 7 are currently enrolled (3 PhD, 2 master?s, and 2 bachelor?s degree programs) and 62 students graduated (13 associates, 2 certificates, 45 bachelor?s, 2 master?s) for a graduation rate of 89%. In comparison, only 18.8% of deaf adults complete a bachelor?s degree or more (Garberoglio, Palmer, Cawthon, &amp; Sales, 2019).\n\nConclusions\n\nDHH students engaged with different STEM-focused activities through our virtual academic community, suggesting the diversity of support structures was key. Further, our project participants graduated at a rate of 70% higher than the national average.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lisa B Elliot"
