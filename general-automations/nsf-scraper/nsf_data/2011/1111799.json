 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\nWith support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry program in the Chemistry Division at NSF, the PI will synthesize colloidal elongated gold and silver nanoparticles and will study their integration with semiconductor and polymer materials.  Through the controlled assembly of these materials, the project will produce nanoscale nonlinear optical switches and fast single photon sources.  Three separate research thrusts will be pursued: (1) Fast nanoscale nonlinear optical switching will be sought by coating an Au bipyramid with or embedding it in a medium exhibiting an optical Kerr effect. Feedback between the intensity-dependent refractive index of the medium and the index-sensitive resonant electric field enhancement can support optical bistability on subpicosecond time scales. (2) Picosecond single photon sources will be designed to take advantage of the large and anisotropic field enhancement of a bipyramid, speeding its radiative rate and defining its polarization state.  (3) Since silver is a better plasmonic material than Au at optical frequencies and there are no existing synthesis of small monodispersed Ag antenna with narrow Plasmon resonance, the PI will undertake synthetic strategies to produce monocrystalline Ag nanorods with good shape yield and monodispersity using in particular underpotential deposition (UPD) of lower work function metals to control surface energy and stability.\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abstract\r\nWith support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry at NSF, this project will impact three separate scientific areas: colloidal synthesis, plasmonic materials, and education.  Colloidal synthesis is a field still in its infancy and this project will focus on the development of new methods to control both the shape of the particle and its assembly into more complex structures.  Electronic processing has changed society profoundly, and the processing of light is already ubiquitous in telecommunications and promises to continue to develop. Ultrafast nanoscale optical switches and single photon sources must be developed as part of this progress, and this project will chemically produce and characterize these two basic but essential elements.  The research project will educate two PhD students to become skilled and creative scientists at the frontier in an interdisciplinary research area, intersecting physics and chemistry.  The PI will also develop curricular materials and optical demonstrations to bring an understanding of the properties of light and colloidal materials to disadvantaged high school students and to the public at large.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTechnology needs increasingly fast and efficient sensing and computing technology.  The very large optical response of metal nanoparticles can potentially be useful for both.  By making complex shape with sharp-antenna like tips and nanoscale gaps, it is well known from the laws of electromagnetism that enormous sensing improvements are possible.   The experimental project developed the synthesis of the well-shaped nanoantenna formed by colloidal solution, and explored methods to assemble them in controlled fashion. The grant, supporting the research of one graduate student full time for a period of 4 years, led to individual results as well as several successful collaborations.  Using a particular synthetic procedure, we were able to make \"nanobipyramids\" of gold, which as highly uniform in shape and size, and exhibit the attributes of large \"lightning rod\" effect at their sharp tips.   Then by controlling the colloidal stability, we were able to obtain a range of assemblies of the bipyramids, focusing on dimers.  These dimers form preferentially in a tip to tip or \"bowtie\" arrangement, which, according to calculations, is the ideal configuration to maximize the interaction and internal fields.  We then used a lengthy process of structural characterization with electron microscopy technique to get high resolution images of the ~ 100 nm structures, and matching the structures with the optical spectra obtained by dark field scattering,  we were able to correlate structure and optical response.  One surprising effect is the propensity of the tip to tip assembly, rather than side to side.  For example, human beings tend to associate naturally in a compact crowd rather than single file, quite unlike the bipyramids.  The main reason is that there is a strong electrostatic repulsion, larger for side to side approach, than tip-to-tip.  When the colloid is destabilized the primary tip to tip approach then leads to the single file assembly.  Another effect is the very large optical changes from a single bipyramid to the bow-tie.   The optical resonance shifts by 3 times the natural resonance width.   We were able to observe the tuning of the shift with increasing degree of overlap, 4 meV/nm.  Another approach for tip to tip assembly was explored using a grooved substrate.  Based on capillary forces we were able assemble gold nanorods on a grooved polymer surface with very high fidelity.  In collaborative work with other groups, our colloidal nanoparticles were used to report of optically driven assemblies.   Finally, the high quality of the optical response and uniform shape/size of the colloidal bipyramids was used to report on the viscosity and elasticity of water.   In this experiments, a laser beam very briefly heats the nanoparticle in water.  This leads to a sudden thermal expansion, akin to a hammer hitting a bell.   The particles then undergo a measurable ringing that lasts as long as it takes for the energy to dissipate or the various nanoparticle to get out of phase.  A large part of the dissipation takes place in the liquid around the particles, and the experiments were able to monitor the dissipation at these very short time scales (ps) and length scales (&lt; 100 nm).  As an results, deviations from the expected Newtonian fluid response were observed, providing one of the first evidence for the effect of internal structure of water on its viscoelastic properties.   Overall, the grant provided a foundation to develop further the controlled assembly of metal nanostructures.  The next stage will be to take advantage of these structures to achieve enhanced sensing or optical nonlinearity. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/09/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philippe Guyot-Sionnest"
