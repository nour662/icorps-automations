 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individuals of the same species often differ in important traits, and these differences are known functions of genetic and environmental influences. For most species, however, a mechanistic understanding of the origin and maintenance of individual variation is still missing. This project proposes mechanistic connections among three seemingly unrelated traits: investment in sexual versus asexual reproduction, feeding performance on rich versus poor resources, and susceptibility to parasites. The investigators hypothesize that differences in feeding rates create a causal chain of relationships that ultimately promotes the maintenance of diversity through basic ecological mechanisms. To test these ideas, the research combines monitoring of biodiversity and diseases in natural populations with laboratory experiments designed to disentangle genetic versus environmental factors shaping the traits of individuals. By determining how seemingly unrelated traits are integrated into distinct strategies, and examining how the frequency of different strategies varies along a natural ecological gradient, the research will provide novel insights into the ecological pressures maintaining phenotypic and genetic variation in natural populations. \r\n\r\nResults from this study will significantly advance understanding of how diseases spread and how biodiversity is maintained. Diverse educational opportunities will be provided for undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and research technicians. The investigators will develop a public lecture series, a summer science camp, and a new biology-mathematics course, and support activities focused on recruitment, retention and mentoring of students from under-represented groups.",

Instead, individual females chose to increase production of sons vs. daughters during disease epidemics. Thus, parasites play a role in the ecology and evolution of sex. Third, we found that disease shifts host populations towards higher frequency of juveniles by increasing mortality of more vulnerable adults (and not by delaying development into adults and/or slowing feeding rate of adult hosts).

Fifth, in an important spin-off project, we developed a statistical and experimental method to separate exposure to parasites (feeding) vs. susceptibility to infection by parasites consumed. Using this technique, we produced important new insights into connections between temperatures and disease. For instance, we found that warmer temperatures make larger disease epidemics by speeding up infection by parasites (and also by increasing production of parasites within hosts). Additionally, we learned that parasite made when warmer are more infectious per parasite. Yet, very warm temperatures could lower this infectiousness and also harm parasites in their environmental phase. Thus, by focusing on feeding rate and disease, the Indiana portion of this collaboration produced new insights into a set of inter-related concepts, including: outcomes of disease epidemics with competitors; allocation of effort to sexual reproduction among populations; shifts in ratios of juveniles to adults in populations (which has implications for how ecosystems function); discovery of a counter-intuitive result (hydra effect) which may help explain why some populations do not suffer catastrophic declines in density during epidemics; and new insights into why warmer temperatures could make host populations sicker (within limits).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/02/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Spencer&nbsp;R&nbsp;Hall</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
