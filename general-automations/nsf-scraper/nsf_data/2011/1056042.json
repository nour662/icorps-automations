 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will combine theory, numerical modeling, and observations of sporadic meteors and meteoroid plasmas in order to address fundamental questions regarding their origin and influence on the upper atmosphere.   This work breaks the problem of meteor characterization into three components,  focusing on their ablation in the ionosphere, the transport of the plasma surrounding the meteor head, and properties of its electromagnetic radiation scattering (known as \"echoes\").  The experimental program utilizes archival meteor head echo measurements from four radars at diverse geographical locations as well as new data acquired from these facilities following implementation of novel experimental configurations.   The theory and modeling component includes improvements to an existing ablation model, modeling of plasma plume expansion using a particle-in-cell approach, and development of a fully electromagnetic scattering model to identify peak plasma densities associated with ionospheric irregularities.  In addition to graduate student involvement in all aspects of the research, the work will also incorporate undergraduate curriculum development efforts.  This project will build on extensive experience in public outreach regarding space physics research.",

The project funded 5 students at Stanford University, including Dr. Ryan Volz who won one of the student awards at the International URSI conference and is currently employed at MIT Millstone Observatory.  Though this research, we sought to address the following 3 scientific questions:\n\n1) What are the properties of meteoroid plasmas, including peak plasma densities and distributions as a function of meteoroid parameters?\n\n2) What ae the properties of meteoroids, including mass, radius and density?\n\n3) What are the effects of the background fields on meteoroid plasma formation and distribution?\n\nWe collected multi-frequency radar data at ALTAIR, Jicamarca Observatory, Arecibo Observatory and PFISR, where we also deployed a CCD camera to detect simultaneous radar-optical meteors.  In order to enable flexible, high-resolution measurements, a sparsity-based radar waveform inversion technique was developed and found to eliminate processing artifacts caused by the standard matched filter approach. The result is cleaner data that limits artifacts such as self-intereference of range-spread targets (i.e. meteor trails) and allows us to discriminate more cleanly meteor plasma from background ionospheric plasma.  \n\nOur modeling approach included developing CFD models to capture the meteoroid ablative process and plasma formation, PIC algorithms to model the plasma expansion and subsequent behavior, and FDTD scattering algorithms to understand the interaction of the radar wave with the plasma.  By combining our CFD models with the data, we were also able to determine both beta (the ionization probabilty) and tau (the luminous efficiency) for a subset of meteoroids ablating at similar altitudes.  This allowed us to forward model the peak plasma density (and distribution of plasma density) as a function of meteoroid mass, bulk density, velocity and altitude of ablation.  Furthermore, we were able to characterize the differential ablation in our radar measurements.  The results from the PIC algorithms, which were developed to characterize the head echo (i.e. the plasma immediately around the meteoroid), demonstrated that a compact, highly-dense plasma forms with a strong dependence on altitude.  We explored the plasma density distribution and found a 1/r falloff (which contradicts previous assumptions).  Our FDTD scattering algorithm then allowed us to correlate the SNR of the radar signal with the peak plasma density, which showed a strong dependence on meteoroid velocity and ablation altitude.  Furthermore, our results were able to explain the discrepancy between RCS values between different high-power, large-aperture radars by illustrating the frequency-dependent scattering characteristics of the meteoroid plasma.  \n\nOur data showed that most meteoroids originate from interplanetary comets with masses between 0.01 and 100 micrograms, and bulk densities at or below 1 g/cm^3.  A small subset (&lt; 20%) of the meteoroids were asteroidal in nature with bulk densities between 2 and 6 g/cm^3.  Typical velocities for cometary meteoroids were between 50-60 km/s, while asteroidal meteroids had slower velocities (&lt; 30 km/s).  The average altitude of ablation was 104 km (dependent on geographic location and radar frequency).  Interestingly, a small subset (&lt; 10%) of our data appear to be interstellar in nature, which is an area for future research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sigrid Close"
