 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research initiation grant will investigate how to implement writing techniques that enable engineering students to develop broad technical problem-solving skills.  Such problem solving is a key outcome of engineering degree programs.  The techniques developed are expected to be easily incorporated into existing engineering degree programs.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be in the area of student development, and creation of the engineering workforce.  Student participants are expected to develop both as engineers and future researchers.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.",
