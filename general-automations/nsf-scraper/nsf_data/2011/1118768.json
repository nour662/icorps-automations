This conference is held annually, at l'Universite Laval in Quebec in even years and at the University of Maine in odd years. By providing a forum for number theorists from New England, Quebec, and beyond to present and discuss their research, the conference promotes interaction and collaboration between Canadian and American number theorists.\r\n\r\nThis year the featured topic at the conference is Arithmetic and p-adic Dynamics.  This is a relatively new line of research in number theory that brings ideas from the classical theory of dynamical systems to the setting of algebraic varieties over number fields and local fields.  Several of the architects of this field will lecture on the broad themes of the subject, the latest results, and possibilities for future development.  There will also be invited speakers addressing other important areas of number theory, with 25-30 speakers in all.  The small scale of the meeting (with around 60 attendees) makes this a good opportunity for graduate students and young mathematicians to interact with leading researchers.",
