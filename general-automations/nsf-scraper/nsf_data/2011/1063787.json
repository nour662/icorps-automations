 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThis DDEP award provides funding to support laboratory work in Taiwan by Ph.D. candidate, John Atkinson, in his study of new carbon materials for catalytic destruction of toxic combustion products, namely, nitrogen oxides, mercury, dioxins and furans. The PI and Mr. Atkinson are supported by an NSF award for work in this area on their home campus, but two laboratories in Taiwan offer unique experimental facilities for testing of candidate carbon materials. Mr. Atkinson will spend six weeks in Taiwan, at National Central University and at National Taipei University of Technology, to undertake combustion-gas-cleaning experiments, i.e., to accomplish simultaneous catalytic conversion of several trace pollutants that appear in combustion gases. The visit to Taiwan will allow the PhD candidate to study in detail the conversion of dioxins and furans into benign species in a reactor equipped with a high resolution spectrographic analyzer for identifying reaction products. Such an apparatus is not available in the U.S. Also, he will study the ability of carbon-based materials to oxidize mercury species using a fixed bed reactor in another facility that is not readily available in the U.S.  Thus, the intellectual merit of the activity stems from the additional insight into the chemistry of these reaction systems that would not be otherwise accessible.\r\n\r\nIn addition to enhancing the professional development of this young researcher and providing valuable data for his PhD thesis, the project should contribute to development of improved technologies for environmental protection. The dioxins can bioaccumulate and cause biological harm, as can mercury. New improved and inexpensive catalysts will permit destruction of these organic compounds and oxidation of elemental mercury. Oxidized mercury is more soluble in water and therefore more susceptible to absorption in a subsequent scrubbing process.   Another significant consequence of the activity will be to strengthen the international relationship of the University of Illinois with the two institutions in Taiwan.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe versatility of carbon makes it ideal for use in multi-pollutant control applications.  The fundamental removal or destruction mechanisms when using carbonaceous materials can be vastly different for controlling nitric oxide (NO, physical adsorption and catalysis for oxidation), mercury (Hg, physical or chemical adsorption), and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins or dibenzofurans (PCDD/F, physical adsorption and reactive destruction).  In this Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Project (DDEP), efforts were made to develop a carbon-based material that could simultaneously oxidize NO to NO2 while adsorbing Hg or adsorbing/destroying PCDD/F.  Our goal was to prepare a multi-functional catalyst and adsorbent that could be applied as an air pollution control technology for all of these contaminants.  This new technology would reduce the exorbitant costs of trace contaminant control (ppbv or pptv concentration scale) by combining it with control of a higher concentration contaminant, NO (ppmv concentration scale).  International collaboration with researchers at two universities in Taiwan was required to test for trace contaminant control, as the necessary facilities were not readily available in the United States.  A University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Ph.D. student spent over two months researching in Taiwan as a result of this funding, and the results that he obtained contributed to his dissertation.  Other outcomes of this DDEP include methods and reactor developments that allow for multi-pollutant control testing, fundamental progress in the fields of carbon science and air pollution control, and improved collaborative efforts between UIUC, National Central University (NCU, Taiwan), and National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT, Taiwan). \n\nWe developed reactors at NCU and NTUT for testing NO oxidation with simultaneous control of PCDD/F or Hg, respectively.  Such improvements to the reactors, which previously could only quantify control of single contaminants, are important because they allow for the development and testing of catalysts and/or adsorbents that can be used for multi-pollutant control.  In this project, the modified reactors were benchmarked by testing tailored carbon materials (prepared at UIUC) for NO oxidation with simultaneous control of PCDD/F or Hg.  Future research is planned to investigate other multi-pollutant control applications for these reactors, relying on the background provided by our initial testing.\n\nWe also showed, for the first time, carbon functioning simultaneously as a catalyst for controlling one air pollutant and an adsorbent for removing another pollutant.  This is a major development in the fields of carbon science and air pollution control, as it highlights the versatility of carbon and expands its possible air pollution control applications.  Specifically, we showed independent NO oxidation and Hg adsorption using a tailored carbon material with properties appropriate for controlling both contaminants.  NO oxidation performance was not affected by the presence of gas phase and/or adsorbed Hg, even after prolonged exposure to unrealistically high mercury concentrations (180 &mu;g/m3), implying that the two contaminants can be controlled using the same carbon material.\n\nFinally, this work initiated collaborative research efforts between UIUC and two research universities in Taiwan.  To date, this DDEP project has resulted in two conference proceedings (to be presented in June and July 2013), and we have one peer-reviewed manuscript that is under preparation.  This work included contributions from at least four Ph.D. students, one M.S. student, one undergraduate student, and three faculty members.  We are optimistic about continued collaborative research in the future, which also comes as a direct result of this funding.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/14/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark J Rood"
