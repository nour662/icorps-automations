 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many applications in science and engineering encounter the problem of\r\nidentifying and processing topologically interesting features in the\r\ndigital representation of a geometry or data. Such features often need\r\nto be optimal with respect to some metric (measurement). It is\r\nrecognized that homology groups from algebraic topology play an\r\nessential role in these computations. Although the study of structural\r\nproperties of the homology groups has a rich history in mathematics,\r\ntheir computations in combination with geometry are not that well\r\nstudied. The principal investigators (PIs) propose to study these\r\nfundamental questions thoroughly, along with their connections to\r\npractical problems from science and engineering.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Efficient solutions of the optimality questions in\r\nhomology computations require both mathematical and algorithmic\r\ndevelopments. The PIs bring aboard these required expertise. Apart\r\nfrom the synergistic effect of the proposed study on mathematics and\r\ntheoretical computer science, the close ties with various applications\r\nin science and engineering will play a synergistic role between\r\ncomputational fields such as computer graphics, computer vision,\r\nsensor networks, computer aided design, and scientific fields such as\r\nbiology, physics, chemistry, and others.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: Optimization of aspects of homology groups provides\r\nimportant insights in many scientific and engineering applications\r\nranging from tunnels in protein molecules to voids in large\r\nmachines. Solutions of such problems can aid in the manufacturing of\r\nbetter machines, designing of new drugs, and rapid modeling of\r\ncustomized objects. The educational impact of this project is in a\r\nlarge synergy between mathematics and computer science motivated by\r\nreal applications. Course notes, internet distributions, and software\r\nsystems developed through the project will enable the scientific\r\ncommunity to study challenging problems in geometry, topology, and\r\nalgorithms. Graduate students supported by the project will develop\r\nskills in mathematics and theoretical computer science and also in\r\nwriting robust, efficient, and user-friendly software.",
