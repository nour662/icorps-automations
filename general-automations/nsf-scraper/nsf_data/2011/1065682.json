 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching question that Scale, Consumers and Lotic Ecosystem Rates (SCALER) will address is: How can small-scale ecological experiments be applied to understand the behavior of entire ecological systems? Funds are provided to address:: 1) How should measures of fundamental properties of streams and effects of animals on those properties be scaled up to predict ecosystem characteristics of stream networks. 2) How do patterns of scaling compare across the wide array of ecological systems (from tundra to tropical forest) that occurs across North American? The SCALER experiment will be done in tropical forest, temperate mountainous forest, prairie, northern boreal evergreen forest, and tundra areas. Streams in each of these five areas will be examined at scales of centimeters to 10?s of meters in small, medium and large streams.  Rates of stream metabolism (photosynthesis and respiration) and nutrient uptake will be measured as well as the way these rates respond to animal exclusions (used to mimic loss of animal diversity in streams). These local results will be linked to the scale of watersheds and regions by modeling. Watershed scale predictions will be verified by broader, but less intensive sampling. Mechanistic explanation of how ecological measurements and experiments in streams can be scaled to watersheds will be provided. This scaling will be characterized in each of the five areas across the continent to explore how scaling differs across natural habitats.  The knowledge that will be generated by this project is essential to quantify controls on stream ecosystem processes as well as to manage human impacts on entire watersheds. The experimental and modeling results will be relevant to general ecology because few nested, and experimental and theoretically coupled scaling experiments have been undertaken in any environment. Results will inform those involved in conservation, management, and restoration of freshwater resources. Resource managers will gain a quantitative rationale and framework to link local measurements to regional patterns. The highly collaborative team will train six graduate students, five post doctoral students, and mentor three early career faculty members. Additional collaborations will be encouraged to collaborate and perform similar projects at additional sites through workshops related to the objectives and research design.",

However, increasingly, a wider portion of the public is realizing that there are important connections between the Arctic and the global environment, which could have real impacts at a local level; e.g., sea level rise and expanded growing seasons. Understanding these connections is essential for future management and policy decisions. The Scale, Consumers and Lotic Ecosystem Rates (SCALER) project was a continental-scale experiment designed to address a simple but fundamentally complex question. Specifically: What is the best way to use measurements that are typically taken at very local (small) scales and expand them to regional and continental scales that are of most interest to policy makers and resource managers?&nbsp; This is a question that is of direct interest to the National Environmental Observatory Network (NEON) and to the general science and management communities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Arctic component of the SCALER project was one of five collaborative projects distributed strategically across the United States to capture a broad suite of environmental conditions from Arctic, through Temperate, to Tropical biomes. At each SCALER research site, we established six experimental stream reaches (sites) with measurements nested at two scales (microhabitat, reach), linked to watershed models. Extensive (synoptic) sampling at each site was used to characterize watershed-scale patterns of nutrients in stream networks at particular moments in time.

Our efforts to capture the \"state\" of entire stream networks at particular moments in time (via synoptic sampling) has revealed patterns in solute concentrations (e.g., nitrate and dissolved organic carbon) that help us interpret how landscape factors (presence of lakes, land cover, land disturbance) influence patterns of nutrient availability across this landscape and potentially influence ecosystem processes (e.g., stream metabolism and nutrient uptake) as well as the distributions of organisms that live in these streams. We are not yet at the point where we can reliably make these latter connections. However, our approach is being utilized in a new generation of research projects to try to connect landscape characteristics to nutrient patterns and ultimately to carbon processing in stream ecosystems.</p>\n<p>We also did experiments to explore relationships between the size of particles (i.e., gravel, pebbles, and cobbles) and fundamental ecosystem processes (specifically, stream metabolism and nutrient uptake). Our experiments revealed that the frame of reference used to express these relationships can completely alter the interpretation of the results.&nbsp; Specifically, we found that when rates are expressed in terms of two-dimensional area on the bottom of the stream (planar basis), the rates decrease strongly as particle size increases.&nbsp; But when expressed in terms of the actual surface area of the rocks under the same planar area (surface area basis), the rates increase slightly with particle size. This suggests that these important ecosystem rates may be distributed fairly evenly on particle surfaces. However, because particles of different sizes have different surface areas, rates expressed on a planar basis may differ.
