 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project examines the ways that people come to understand themselves to be part of larger communities in the context of the world's largest ecological restoration project. The study focuses on a rural 20- by 40-mile region of the Everglades and the responses to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. It uses research methods that include long-term participant observation, interviews, and case studies of two major restoration projects. The researcher investigates two questions: 1) How do residents of an ecologically and culturally diverse area of the Everglades value water and land, especially in their everyday practices?; and 2) How do these everyday practices enact belonging in the context of restoration? \r\n\r\nThis research project will offer social scientific findings related to the four components for measuring the effectiveness of Everglades restoration as outlined in the 2000 Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. In addition, the findings will be shared with local communities in the Everglades area and the larger academic community.",

Less well known or studied than the subtropical wetland&rsquo;s ecological attributes or its notorious legal battles, however, are the complex cultural processes at play in the Everglades. Employing ethnographic methods that included participant observation, more than 100 interviews, observation, and archival research, sociocultural anthropologist Jessica Cattelino sought to understand how water shaped community in a vibrant corner of the Everglades where basic social science about the relationship between cultural processes and ecology could be investigated. The northwest Everglades is home to sugarcane, citrus, and vegetable growers, Seminole indigenous water rights claimants, bass anglers and hunters, water managers, environmentalists, and an array of other residents with deep and sometimes divergent relations to water. After completing eight months of intensive ethnographic fieldwork as well as research in multiple archives and with government reports and other primary materials, Cattelino is developing a series of scholarly articles, an ethnographic book, public lectures and trainings, the prestigious Morgan Lecture, and a collaborative museum exhibition with a photographer.
