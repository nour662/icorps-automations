 "awd_abstract_narration": "The geomagnetic field is generated by a so-called `fluid dynamo'. This dynamo is driven by rapidly rotating, turbulent convection in Earth's molten metal core. Yet rapidly rotating core-style convective turbulence has not been accurately simulated.  The goal of this project is to provide the first cross-disciplinary quantification of rapidly rotating, turbulent, core-style convection.  In doing so, we will greatly strengthen our understanding of the core flows that turn Earth into a giant magnet.\r\n\r\nWe will develop next-generation models of turbulent convection in Earth's core to address significant limitations in current models of dynamo generation.  These models will combine leading laboratory rotating convection experiments with state-of-the-art finite element models and with advanced, asymptotically reduced theoretical models of rotating convection systems.  The data we will produce will be of fundamental importance to modelers of Earth's core and other planetary dynamos, as well as modelers of solar and stellar convection zones and dynamos, and modelers of Earth's climate and planetary atmospheres. The asymptotically reduced modeling tools will be made openly available through the Computational Infrastructure for Geosciences (CIG) website. Furthermore, we will develop a unique library of geoscience educational films, via an ongoing internship for students interested in combining science and documentary filmmaking.",
