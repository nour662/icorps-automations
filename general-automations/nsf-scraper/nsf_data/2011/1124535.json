 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigators from Rice University and Duke University will build a Personalized Cyberlearning System, designed around three principles from cognitive science (retrieval practice, spacing, and enhanced feedback), that leverages advances in machine learning and makes use of an existing instructional content material and problem set database aimed at undergraduate engineering students. The system will use artificial intelligence methods to optimize practice and feedback for students. Research will seek to advance knowledge, in a real-world setting, about a range of issues concerning how feedback facilitates learning, how individual differences come in to play, as well as those more specifically aimed at the development of the learning technology system itself.\r\n\r\nThe project is important as part of the effort to harness the vast quantities of information on the web to personalize instruction for a wide range of learners. Moreover, the development of such cyberlearning technologies holds promise for opening up STEM education for motivated self-learners while also allowing access to a large volume of material for a range of students who might not otherwise have it.",

This \"one-size-fits-all\" approach forces them into artificial timelines for learning that often result in them either becoming bored or falling behind. Recent advances in technology provide the opportunity to revolutionize education by tailoring instruction and activities to the needs and characteristics of each student in order to maximize their learning outcomes.\n\nIn recent years, many different approaches towards achieving the goal of personalized learning have emerged, such as instructional modules that enable students to learn at their own pace and interactive computer programs designed to respond to the learner\u00c6s questions.\n\nIn this project, we developed and tested a new personalized learning system called OpenStax Tutor that makes two key innovations. First, it uses powerful machine learning algorithms to track students\u00c6 learning progress as they work through online course materials.  Second, it integrates several principles from the science of learning (cognitive psychology) that both improve and reinforce student learning. \n\nIn addition to developing new machine learning algorithms and advancing the science of learning, the OpenStax Tutor platform has been used at 19 colleges and universities across the country, improving the learning outcomes of thousands of college students.
