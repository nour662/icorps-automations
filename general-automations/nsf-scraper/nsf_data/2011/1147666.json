 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies have revealed significant warming of lakes throughout the world, but scientists are just beginning to understand the global extent, regional patterns, causes, and ecological consequences of lake warming. The Global Lake Temperature Collaboration (GLTC) was established in 2010 to coordinate activities of an international group of investigators with access to global lake temperature records. The GLTC, now comprised of more than 50 investigators, will hold a workshop to bring participants to a common location to synthesize temperature data collected at lakes and by satellites into a global database, assess the causes and ecological implications of the observed changes in lake temperature, identify directions for future research, and develop plans for data management and education and outreach. Specific research topics that will be addressed at the workshop will include temperature trends and how they vary around the globe, climatic and geographic factors that may influence temperature trends, comparability of temperature trends in surface and deeper waters, and likely ecological consequences of observed changes in lake temperatures. \r\nThe broader impacts of the workshop will include the development of international collaborations, enhancement of infrastructure for research and education by creating a unified database of lake temperature data, integration of research and education through student interaction and curriculum development, and dissemination of workshop results and data through publications, conferences, a project website, and education and outreach activities.",
