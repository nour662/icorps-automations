 "awd_abstract_narration": "End-to-end data transfer rate requirements in the computational science communities\r\n---including computational biology, physics, astronomy, medicine, and environmental\r\nmodeling--- are soon to approach the terabit-per-second regime. Unfortunately, the\r\nstate-of-the-art in end-to-end transport protocol implementations scales to at most a\r\nfew gigabit-per-seconds of single-stream steady-state throughput. This project will\r\ndevelop a 10Gbps+ Linux transport-layer stack of the novel paradigm of \"packet-scale\r\ncongestion-control\", which can potentially improve scalability by several orders of\r\nmagnitude. For this, the project will: (i) develop a non ACK-clocked state machine\r\nthat replaces the TCP state machine, and (ii) develop both software-based as well as\r\nhardware-assisted high-speed implementations of precise inter-packet gap control and\r\npacket timestamping. The implementation will be extensively tested on a 10Gbps\r\nin-laboratory test-bed as well as on nationwide NLR paths. The project will then\r\npartner with up to three projects from the scientific domain, for deploying and\r\nevaluating the impact of the protocol stack on their infrastructure. The resultant\r\nimplementation is expected to be transformative in the design and implementation of\r\nnon ACK-clocked transport protocols. It is expected to dramatically improve large\r\nhigh-speed bulk data transfers, without requiring expensive dedicated networks, thus\r\nrevolutionizing how the computational science community relies on the networking\r\ninfrastructure.",
