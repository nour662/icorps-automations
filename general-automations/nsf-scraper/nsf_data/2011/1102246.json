 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to create topological integrated optomechanics to enable transformational solutions to current limitations in high confinement photonic integrated circuits.  The approach is based on the realization of three-dimensional optical waveguides that guide light out-of-plane.  The comprehensive research program involves design, fabrication, and test.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Three-dimensional photonic integrated circuits will harness phenomena of purely topological origin to create broadband polarization transparent photonic integrated circuits.  Out-of-plane optical waveguides will also be developed to realize broadband and low loss fiber-to-chip and vertical chip-to-chip couplers.  Broadband coupling and direct access to devices on an entire chip surface without dicing or cleaving the chip are enabled.  Tunable, broadband, polarization transparent, and compact system architectures involving high speed transport of data between and within photonic integrated circuits are envisioned.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts:   The universality of topological phenomena enables the development of optical laboratory experiments with results that may be extrapolated to a variety of physical systems where laboratory experiments are economically unfeasible.  The research concept extends to applications in future high performance optical networks, all-optical switching, and optical logic computing.  The program responds to the challenge of preparing science and engineering students to be successful in an increasingly interdisciplinary and global environment by developing a global scientists and engineers pipeline at Ohio State University.  Furthermore, modules will be created for an integrated optics curriculum that engenders integrative research thinking.  Finally, undergraduates, minority student, and students from underrepresented groups will be involved in the research program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Advances in high bandwidth communications, advanced signal processing, and intelligent sensors are enabled by the convergence of electronics and photonics on the scale of a microelectronic circuit.  In microelectronic integrated circuits, charge carriers utilize metal interconnects, whereas in photonic integrated circuits, photons are guided in optical waveguides.   Guided optical waves exhibit inherent properties including amplitude, phase, frequency, wavelength, and polarization.  It is challenging, however, to electrically manipulate the polarization state of light in planar optical waveguides.  \nIn this research, we have introduced out-of-plane optical waveguides, allowing access to Berry's phase, a quantum mechanical phenomenon of purely topological origin.  As a result, electrically tunable optical polarization rotation on the chip-scale was achieved for the first time.  Devices fabricated in the silicon-on-insulator material platform are no longer limited to a single static polarization state.  Rather, they can exhibit dynamic tuning of polarization from the fundamental transverse electric mode to the fundamental transverse magnetic mode.  Compact system architectures involving dynamic control of optical polarization in integrated circuits have been enabled.  \nOut-of-plane optical waveguides have also been shown to be an enabling technology for coupling light from an optical fiber to a photonic integrated circuit.  We have experimentally demonstrated the most compact fiber-to-chip light coupler reported in the literature.  In the telecommunications wavelength range, coupling losses are less than 1 dB per connection.  The compact, broadband, and low-loss coupling scheme enables direct access to silicon photonic integrated circuits on an entire chip surface without the need for dicing or cleaving the chip.  The fiber-to-chip coupling was also extended to vertical chip-to-chip coupling.  The couplers enable broadband and compact system architectures involving high speed vertical data transport between silicon photonic integrated circuits.    \nThe global and cross-disciplinary nature of silicon photonic integrated circuit research drove the focus of our integrated educational plan.
