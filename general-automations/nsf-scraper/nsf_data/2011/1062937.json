 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year renewal REU Site program at Louisiana Tech University in Micro/Nanoengineering will focus on the Scientific Method and Engineering Design Process as frameworks for developing students as independent researchers. The REU program will work with 9 undergraduate students per year over a 10 week period in the summer to provide a research experience in micro/nano engineering, train them more formally on the research issues, and make them aware of issues related to analyzing, interpreting and reporting.  The students' experience will culminate in a journal article-style report, a formal oral presentation, and an NSF-style research proposal detailing the next phase in their work. The intellectual merit of this proposal is in the micro/nano engineering research that will be accomplished. Ongoing work in this area includes development of microcantelever sensors, microfluidics, carbon nanotubes, tissue scaffolds, and drug-delivery methods along with investigation of material-cell interactions and cellular responses to nanostructures.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposal is in the preparation of undergraduates for careers in research. The targeted participants will be students who are in undergraduate programs in Engineering, or the Sciences. Recruitment efforts will target women and minority students into the program, particularly underrepresented students from Grambling State University, Southern University, Prairie View A&M, Jackson State University, Alcorn State University, Mississippi Valley State University, Alabama A&M University, Alabama State University, Texas Southern University and Texas Women's University and other universities in the region which have limited laboratory research opportunities for students. Student deliverables will be analyzed to determine the impact of the Scientific Method and Engineering Design Process frameworks on the ability to perform research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nREU Report for the General Public\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis project introduced 30 undergraduate students to research in microengineering and nanoengineering.  Students performed research in the laboratory of an established researcher and were formally trained on several aspects of research, including the scientific method, the engineering design process, project planning, background research, technical communication, data analysis, and engineering ethics.  At the end of the program, each student was asked to write a formal description of their research and to use their imagination to develop and write a formal proposal for a new research question that could be pursued in the future.  Three requirements for the new question were that it must be important to the state of the art, answerable with reasonable resources, and applicable to current societal concerns.\n\nEach student participated for 10 weeks.  Participants were at all undergraduate levels, from freshman to senior.\n\nIntellectual merit\n\nThe projects undertaken by the students can be categorized into six basic areas, renewable energy, engineering materials, neural engineering, blood-clotting analysis, genetic engineering and analysis, and drug delivery.\n\nRenewable energy was addressed by students who coated materials with various types of nanoparticles to harvest energy. Figure 1, for example, shows a beam coated with carbon nanotubes and piezoelectric nanoparticles for combined light and heat energy harvesting.\n\nNew engineering materials, or new, more cost-effective methods for the production of materials, were examined for various purposes.  Methods for creating nanodiamond-coated materials were examined for ultimate use as biocompatible surfaces for implants and biosensors.  A new method for production of graphene (Figure 2), a modern material with a wide variety of anticipated uses, was examined. Other materials were examined for their use in microfluidic systems for diagnostics.\n\nStudents who worked in the area of neural engineering developed methods for modeling nerve cell growth, growing nerve cells in culture, and measuring chemical signals from nerve cells.  An example is the use of nanoparticles to deliver agents (e.g. for chemotherapy of brain tumors) into neuronal cancer cells.  The study illustrated in Figure 3 demonstrated that particle size strongly affected the uniformity of the delivery, with larger, 2 micron particles (top row in the figure) leading to a nonuniform distribution and smaller, 20 nm particles (bottom row in the figure) leading to a more uniform distribution.\n\nDrug delivery projects were directed towards wound treatment with nanoparticles.  The particles allowed simultaneous release of growth factors, which stimulate the wound to heal, and antibiotics, which prevent the growth of bacteria at the wound site.  The targeting of antibiotics is important with respect to the problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria because it allows the antibiotic to be more focused, thus reducing the amount used.  Other drug-delivery areas were the use of silver nanoparticles to prevent bacterial infection, encapsulation of heparin for the prevention of coagulation, and optical tracking of gold nanoparticles for use in cancer therapy.  Figure 4 shows scanning electron microscope images of the silver nanoparticles.\n\nStudents developed new techniques for the generation of surfaces that can be used to examine the adhesion of blood platelets to biological proteins.  The research is of interest because blood clotting is a complex system of activation and inhibition of platelets, and the mechanism through which both activation and inhibition operate simultaneously to produce a well-controlled system is not yet understood.  Figure 5 shows microchannels used in this research.\n\nGenetics was addressed with the goals of producing novel methods for DNA sequencing, DNA amplification, and gene therapy. Students contributed to a novel microfluidic device, shown in Figure 6, that allo..."
