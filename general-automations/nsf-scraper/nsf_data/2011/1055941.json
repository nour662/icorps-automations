 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The objectives of this program are to characterize, model, and utilize reflective microring reflectors. The PI proposes engineering novel device functionality by integrating a Bragg reflector in a microring resonator. The microring amplifies grating reflection, creating a compact mirror with high reflectivity, narrow linewidth, and no side lobe ripple. These benefits would reduce channel crosstalk and potentially result in lower power, higher data rate communication systems. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is that the research will advance scientific understanding of the device and demonstrate its potential as a fundamental element to the photonics community. The PI proposes to leverage his preliminary results in device theory, experience in lasers, sensors, and nanofabrication, and experimental capabilities and resources. The research is potentially transformative as it may unlock new lines of research (new devices and models) and enable diverse applications (interferometry, metrology, RF photonics, and communications). Two specific applications will be explored: as cavities for on-chip absorption spectroscopy and as mirrors for tunable lasers.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The broader impacts will be to create novel devices for next generation communications and consumer electronics. Research and teaching will be integrated through the development of two courses: Principles of Experimental Research? and Modeling of Photonic Devices. Recruitment, retention, and participation of students from underrepresented groups will be addressed through mentoring, REU internships, and a new electrical engineering summer camp for 10th-12th grade girls. Results from both research and teaching will be published to enhance the current understanding of reflective microring devices and engineering education/outreach methodologies.",

Successful applications included: demonstrating compact narrowband microring reflectors, determining thermal and optical properties of materials, creating single wavelength lasers, designing biosensors for detecting single cancer-proteins, and realizing a new 3D photonic integration architecture. We trained undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs through grant research and a new &ldquo;Principles of Experimental Research&rdquo; course. We inspired K-12 students through several outreach efforts, most notably the &ldquo;Girls Learning Electrical Engineering&rdquo; camp for high school girls.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The project&rsquo;s first journal paper, &ldquo;Realization of a narrowband single wavelength microring mirror,&rdquo; presented experimental results of an integrated microring Bragg reflector. By combining the Bragg reflector&rsquo;s wavelength selectivity with the microring&rsquo;s high Q-factor, we solved many issues plaguing linear distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs). The grating-integrated microring offers the same peak reflectivity (92%) but is 70x smaller and has a faster roll-off versus wavelength and no side-lobe ripple. We formulated a model based data interpretation method to extract the device&rsquo;s transmission and reflection spectra from the overall system response. The paper and its results are significant to the field of photonics because linear DBRs are ubiquitous in semiconductor lasers.</p>\n<p>Next, we studied laser power induced self-heating dynamics in microrings through theory and experiments. Our coupled thermal-optical model, based on lumped thermal capacitance and optical time-domain coupled-mode theory, agreed well with time-resolved pump-probe experimental data. The model provides engineers a simple method to understand thermal bistability and resonance shifting in microrings.</p>\n<p>Then, we used microrings with and without integrated Bragg reflectors to accurately measure the refractive indices and thermo-optic coefficients of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> core and SiO<sub>x </sub>cladding materials. These parameters are vital in designing microrings to be resonant at a target wavelength; however, they are extremely difficult to measure in fabricated devices. We used the integrated microring Bragg reflector to resolve the mode order ambiguity problem of plain rings along with singular value decomposition to determine the material parameters in an actual device. We validated parameter accuracy by fabricating devices with a resonance wavelength that was within 0.006% of target (0.1nm at 1550nm) without any post process trimming or thermal tuning.</p>\n<p>Next, we theoretically investigated the physics of hybrid whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator biosensors consisting gold epitopes periodically arranged around a silica microsphere&rsquo;s equator. Several interesting system behaviors were observed and explained: a plasmonic chain ring resonator (PCRR) can be formed that efficiently couples to the WGM resonator, this coupling leads to dissimilar behavior in the field localization near the epitopes as epitope size is varied, and collective PCRR oscillations can enhance the wavelength shift caused by a single protein binding event by an order of magnitude. We expect this enhanced sensitivity to enable the detection of individual Thyroglobulin cancer marker proteins, a grand challenge for biosensors.</p>\n<p>We achieved single mode lasing in a normally degenerate microring by engineering large radiation losses for all resonant modes except one. We analyzed selective mode coupling using multipole expansion. Experimental results on electrically pumped microring lasers show that the integrated grating enables single mode lasing without significantly increasing the lasing threshold. The architecture enables compact low threshold single wavelength sources with a lithographically defined emission wavelength.</p>\n<p>Through collaborations, we experimentally demonstrated monolithically integrated 3D self-rolled-up microtube-based vertical couplers with strong axial confinement. We also jointly developed a modal expansion approach for accurately computing resonant modes in a high-Q optical resonator, a domain decomposition technique to enable fast and accurate finite element analysis of photonic devices, and a zeroth order modification of coupled mode theory for waveguide gratings. Lastly, we demonstrated active-passive monolithic integration and showed lasing using the integrated Bragg microring as a passive mirror.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> We trained 10 undergraduates, 5 graduates, and 3 postdocs, resulting in 3 BS and 2 PhD theses. Students learned critical research skills spanning device design, fabrication, testing, and model creation. They developed oral and written skills by writing journal papers and reports and presenting their results at group meetings, departmental seminars, and conferences. Project results were disseminated in 11 journal publications, 8 conference presentations, 1 issued patent, and 1 pending patent. The PI developed a new interdisciplinary course, &ldquo;Principles of Experimental Research,&rdquo; and offered it four times. The course trains new graduate students and advanced undergraduates to be more independent researchers earlier in their careers. The PI along with his graduate and undergraduate assistants created the Girls Learning Electrical Engineering (GLEE) camp. A total of 136 high school girls have attended the residential weeklong summer camp since 2010. In summer 2011, Brain Fitness Fridays was launched to engage K-8 students in STEM activities including nanotechnology and sports science (42 participants).
