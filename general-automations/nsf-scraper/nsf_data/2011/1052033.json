 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThe long-term objective of this project is to understand how proteins are inserted into biological membranes.  The majority of bacterial proteins are inserted into the membrane by the Sec translocase, although a subset is inserted and folded by the YidC translocase. The goal of the research project is to address the novel function of YidC in the generation of the tertiary structure of membrane proteins.  The project has three important aims:  (1) Determine the substrate specificity of YidC by identifying the features of a membrane protein that make it YidC dependent for insertion.  (2) Elucidate the function of YidC in the insertion and folding of integral membrane proteins. (3) Define the transmembrane helix organization of the YidC monomer, and evaluate/extend the YidC dimer model. To achieve these aims, site-directed mutagenesis, YidC depletion strains, protein modification, cysteine crosslinking, and biochemical methods will be used.  These studies will provide clues to similar insertion pathway in eukaryotic cells and provide important information in the biogenesis of membrane proteins such as receptors, channels, transporters, and ATPases. This research is significant in that it targets an important and unique protein, YidC, an evolutionarily conserved and essential protein involved in membrane protein biogenesis. The results of this project will enrich our understanding of the molecular machines involved in the insertion and folding of proteins and will be useful in understanding aberrant membrane protein folding. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe laboratory is active in training and teaching undergraduate and graduate students.  An important part of the undergraduate training is to motivate students to make discoveries and allow them to test hypotheses.  The student's results from this project will be disseminated at conferences and published in top-tiered journals.  The research on membrane protein insertion will be performed in a multidisciplinary research environment involving molecular biology and biochemical approaches.  The lab will recruit and train minority students in research and encourage them to pursue graduate research in the life sciences area.  Dr. Dalbey believes that an interest in the life sciences and research must be cultivated at an early age.  He will pursue relationships with local schools K-12 to introduce the students to the excitement of scientific discovery.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAll cells possess membranes composed of phospholipids and proteins.  Membrane proteins are responsible for many essential cellular functions and are important in cell signaling, energy production and conversion, and metabolite transport.   These membrane proteins are ubiquitous; 30% of the proteome in cells encode membrane proteins.  These proteins vary greatly in size, in their number of transmembrane segments, and topology.  Again illustrating their importance for cell function is the fact that the majority of known drug targets are membrane proteins. \n\n \n\nIn order for proteins to insert into the membrane, cellular machineries that catalyze insertion are present. In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the YidC family of proteins mediates membrane insertion, lateral membrane integration, folding and assembly of membrane proteins.  The bacterial YidC can operate independently or cooperatively with the Sec machinery.\n\n \n\nThe studies in this project were focused on the role of YidC in bacteria and provided insight into how YidC and Sec machineries are selected to insert proteins into the cytoplasmic membrane.  We found that the polarity and charge in the substrate region to be translocated determines the machinery requirements for membrane insertion.  Our studies also showed that YidC functions as a foldase for the lactose transporter.  This is very important because YidC is one of the few membrane proteins that can catalyze folding within the interior of the membrane and does so without hydrolyzing ATP. \n\n \n\nThe structural studies in the last part of the project revealed that YidC contains an aqueous exposed region localized within the inner leaflet of the inner membrane.  This region contains the strictly conserved positively charged residue, which we showed is not required for the E. coli YidC but is needed for the function of the Gram-negative S. mutans YidC.  Crosslinking studies revealed that the cytoplasmic region of YidC is very dynamic.   These findings deepened the understanding of YidC\u00c6s role in membrane insertion and folding, and provided insight into why this protein is found in the three domains of life.\n\n \n\nDuring the award period, the PI was involved in the training of undergraduates and graduate students, as well as outreach, and attended the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority students and hosting students from a Columbus Middle School. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/12/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ross E Dalbey"
