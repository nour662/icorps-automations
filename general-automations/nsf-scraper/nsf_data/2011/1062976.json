The program offers six undergraduate students the opportunity to engage in publishable-quality research projects with scientists working at the forefront of astronomy and astrophysics.  Students are supported at the observatories' compound in La Serena, Chile for 10 weeks during the (austral) summer, and each student is guaranteed a minimum of two nights observing time.  Mentors are selected from the scientific staffs of CTIO, the Southern Observatory for Astronomical Research (SOAR) and the Gemini South 8-m telescope.\r\n\r\nThe students are exposed to the international nature of modern astronomy, and become more globally engaged through living and working abroad and interacting with the local staff and other students.  Exposure to the life and operations of a major international observatory and the diversity of activities conducted therein is an invaluable experience for all concerned.",

Of the 30 students accepted, there were 6 minority students. The broadest goals of the CTIO REU site program are (1) to encourage undergraduates of all demographics, including women and those of minority-rich backgrounds, to pursue careers in science, (2) to foster high levels of scientific literacy among the future Science, Engineering, and Technology (SET) workforce, (3) to promote cross-cultural interaction and knowledge-sharing between US and Chilean students, (4) to stimulate general awareness of the remarkable achievements of US astronomy, and (5) to inspire interest in the future progress and welfare of US science.</p>\n<p>REU students were hired as full-time research assistants for 10 weeks and were mentored by a professional astronomer as they completed an astronomy research project. &nbsp;The REU program was run concurrently with a similar program for Chilean students, called the Pr&aacute;ctica en Investigaci&oacute;n en Astronom&iacute;a (PIA) program, and the cross-cultural interactions between REU and PIA students were an important component of both programs.&nbsp; Each REU and PIA student spent at least two nights taking images of astronomical objects of interest using telescopes on the mountaintop of Cerro Tololo.
