 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent discovery on Oct. 14, 2010, of exceptionally preserved plant and large mammal fossils at\r\nZeigler Reservoir near Snowmass Village, Colorado provides a brief opportunity to study an amazingly\r\nwell-preserved, sequence of high-elevation Ice Age ecosystems. In 18 days (Oct. 29 to Nov. 17, 2010),\r\nthe Denver Museum of Nature & Science (DMNS) excavated more than 600 bones comprising parts of 8-\r\n10 American mastodons, 4 Columbian mammoths, 4 Ice Age bison, 2 deer, 1 Jefferson?s ground sloth\r\n(the first record in Colorado and the highest altitude record in North America), multiple Tiger\r\nsalamanders, and exceptionally preserved plant, insect and aquatic invertebrate fossils. As a whole, the\r\nsite represents the first relatively complete sequence of lacustrine Pleistocene ecosystems at high\r\nelevation in the Rocky Mountains. A number of key research questions and opportunities have emerged:\r\n1) What does this site tell us about high elevation Pleistocene climate and biota in the Ice Age Rockies?\r\n2) What is the geochronology of the site? 3) What is the detailed history of lake in-filling? 4) What were\r\nthe life histories of the site?s mammoths and mastodons? 5) Given the large number of specimens, can we\r\nundertake metapopulation analyses of the bison, mammoth, and mastodon? And 6) what is the relevance\r\nof this Rocky Mountain climate and biotic record to present-day issues of climate change?\r\nTo answer these over-arching questions and other more specific questions, we have assembled a team of\r\n32 scientists from 15 institutions organized into six groups to undertake a comprehensive multidisciplinary\r\nstudy of the Ziegler Reservoir fossil lake. These groups are: 1) regional and local geology; 2)\r\nstratigraphy; 3) geochronology; 4) fossil vertebrates; 5) fossil plants; and 6) fossil invertebrates. Using\r\nthis approach, we are designing a plan to: 1) excavate the remaining fossil resources from the dam site in\r\nMay-June, 2011, before the site is buried by planned dam construction in July-September; 2) implement a\r\ncomprehensive scientific research plan to study and understand this site; 3) preserve and conserve the\r\nfossils from the site; and 4) to use the results of this discovery provide world-class educational\r\nopportunities to local, regional, national, and international audiences. DMNS is planning an\r\ncomprehensive media and documentary plan for the 2011 excavation and DMNS educators will return to\r\nthe Roaring Fork Valley in Spring 2011 to provide free education programs for K-12 students in all of the\r\nRoaring Fork Valley schools, including in-school assembly programs, distance learning programs, teacher\r\nprofessional development programs, and early childhood education resources available on\r\nwww.dmns.org. This grant will partially fund the fieldwork portion of 2011 activities.",
