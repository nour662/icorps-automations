 "awd_abstract_narration": "Texas State University-San Marcos is aggressively developing a new Materials Science, Engineering, and Commercialization (MSEC) Program based on collaboration amongst the Departments of Biology, Chemistry/Biochemistry, Engineering Technology, Physics, and the Ingram School of Engineering. \r\nThe objective of this MRI acquisition of an inductively coupled plasma-reactive ion etching system is to enhance the present capability of the university by providing performance and process consistency necessary to meet the goals of the university?s strong emphasis on interdisciplinary research central to the MSEC program. \r\nThe intellectual merit is in significantly benefitting ongoing research programs including the development of microelectronic devices, micro-actuators, and nano/biomedical applications. Hence, the new service facility is expected to be a catalyst that strengthens current interdisciplinary research partnerships. Furthermore, the multifunctional system being acquired offers a broad capability to the university research community and industrial and government collaborators. The system will be supported, and its effectiveness for research and education sustained, through the development of a user-university-state partnership for stewardship of shared resources. \r\nThe broad impact of this program is to serve as a primary shared resource for Texas State University?s growing public and private sector activity in MSEC. In addition, the university will integrate the use of the system into the students? course, capstone, and research experiences. In summary, the system is essential to the advancement and growth of current research in materials science and engineering linking academic, federal government, and industry labs at Texas State addressing areas of societal concern in the security, health, energy and environmental sectors.",
