 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biennial logic meetings at UCLA have been among the most important forums for mathematical logic on the West Coast for over three  decades. \r\nThe 2011 meeting continues this series. It will emphasize descriptive set theory, theoretical computer science, philosophical logic and linguistics, and complexity theory.  The conference will provide a key opportunity for logicians to learn about and discuss important advances in research, to exchange ideas, and to collaborate on scientific projects. Most of the participants are expected to be research mathematicians and university teachers. At least half the award funds will be used for travel grants to help graduate students and young researchers come to the conference. What they learn at the conference will have a positive impact on their research and teaching.",
