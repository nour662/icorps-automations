 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Jennifer Whiles Lillig from Sonoma State University and colleagues Carmen Works, Steven Farmer and Jon Fukuto will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) characterization of the structure/function relationship of antimicrobial bacteriocins, (b) synthetic methodologies that allow preparation of biologically active derivatives containing the carbazole ring structure, (c) synthesis, characterization, and potential biological applications of HNO donors, and (d) characterization of small chromium(III) binding peptides and functional mimics in chromium biochemistry.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
