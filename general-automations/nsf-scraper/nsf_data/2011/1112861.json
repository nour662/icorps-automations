 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the tectonic processes expressed at Earth's surface are the\r\nmanifestation of processes rooted deeper within the planet.  Variations in\r\ntemperatures and composition of the upper mantle (the layer below the\r\ncrust) combined with the forces that drive motion contribute to the\r\ndeformation patterns at the surface and/or melt generation (possibly\r\nresulting in volcanoes).  Models of the mantle further our understanding\r\nof the evolution of these processes, but these models require accurate\r\nestimates of temperature and composition of the upper mantle---neither\r\nof which can be measured directly.  To estimate the state of the mantle,\r\ngeophysical models of a physical property sensitive to temperature and\r\ncomposition are typically used as a proxy (e.g. seismic velocity and electrical\r\nconductivity).  Using electrical conductivity as a proxy requires\r\nlaboratory measurements on minerals at a range of conditions expected\r\nfor the mantle.  Most interpretations of upper mantle\r\nelectrical conductivity are based only on the mineral olivine,\r\nwhich comprises 60-70% of the mantle, and often ignore the possible\r\ninfluence of the remaining mineral components.  While olivine typically\r\ndominates the electrical conductivity, there are cases, particularly\r\nwhen bound water content is high, where electrical conductivity\r\ncontributions from orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene, the next most\r\nabundant upper mantle minerals, may be disproportionate to their volume.\r\nThis project will involve the collection of electrical conductivity on\r\nmantle pyroxenes in a laboratory controlled setting over a wide range of\r\nphysical conditions, leading to an improved model of dry pyroxene\r\nconductivity.  This model will help improve current,\r\nand aid in future, interpretations of mantle conductivity models and the\r\nprocesses that potentially drive melt generation and surface dynamics.\r\nThis project will also include the building of a conductivity apparatus\r\nthan can be used in future studies as well as the training of a postdoc.\r\n\r\nThere have been few electrical conductivity studies on orthopyroxene and\r\nfewer on clinopyroxene.  While they suggest anhydrous conductivity of\r\northopyroxene is similar to that of olivine, with clinopyroxene about one\r\norder of magnitude lower, they were conducted along predetermined oxygen\r\nfugacity paths, thus limiting their application to specific conditions.  This project\r\nwill focus on the collection of electrical conductivity and thermopower\r\nmeasurements on mantle derived pyroxenes over a wide range of\r\ntemperatures and oxygen fugacities relevant to the mantle.  By\r\ncollecting thermopower measurements in tandem with electrical\r\nconductivity at several oxygen fugacity states and temperatures it\r\nwill be possible to estimate the concentration and mobility of the\r\nvarious charge carriers and build point defect models that extend\r\nconductivity estimates to a much larger range of mantle conditions.  A\r\nsimilar model for olivine has become a standard for comparison with\r\nlaboratory experiments and repeatedly verified in recent experiments.\r\nIn the past few years there has been a great deal of attention paid to\r\nthe effect of water on olivine conductivity.  However, water partitioning\r\nexperiments show that pyroxenes may hold ten times as much bound H2O as\r\nolivine.  Apart from contributing to bulk composition, pyroxenites (rocks\r\nwith >50% pyroxene) are found regionally in veins which are important to\r\nthe geochemical budget, and may be responsible for the \"garnet\r\nsignature\" in mid-ocean ridges and ocean island basalts.  If such veins\r\nform interconnected networks they would have a disproportionate effect\r\non mantle conductivity.  A reliable anhydrous pyroxene conductivity\r\nmodel developed as part of this study will aid interpretation of future\r\nelectrical conductivity experiments on hydrous pyroxenes, as well as \r\nimprove the interpretation of  mantle conductivities inferred from\r\nelectromagnetic sounding.",
