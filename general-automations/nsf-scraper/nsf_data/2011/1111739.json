 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Paul W. Bohn of the University of Notre Dame is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop multifunctional nanoscale fluidic devices.  The project investigates how devices can be constructed so that a single structure can simultaneously switch fluid flow, sense the presence of specific molecules and subsequently subject these molecules to treatment - perhaps remediation of an environmental pollutant or destruction of a harmful biomolecule circulating in the body.  Electrical potentials applied to different regions of the device cause small volumes of fluid to move through specific channels for sensing and treatment.   The projects seek to combine this electrically-activated fluid flow with electrochemical reactions and with sensitive methods of chemical sensing - based either on the luminescence of the molecules after electrochemical reaction or the interaction of high frequency excitations in metals with the surrounding fluid. One critical challenge in carrying out the electrochemical reactions is that they must occur far from ground potential, where such reactions routinely are carried out.  Thus, the project aims to develop new ways to perform electrochemical transformations at arbitrarily large voltages.  The second challenge is that because the structures are so small, only a tiny number of molecules may react at any given time.  Thus, the project seeks to develop new highly sensitive methods of following electron transfer reactions that are applicable to ultrasmall samples, even to single molecules.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this program on society is felt in three ways.  First, the scientific work addresses the control and manipulation of fluid flow in miniature analytical devices, a problem of growing interest to the international scientific community.  Second, the scientific work contributes to scientific human resource development through the involvement of a diverse range of students with participation from under-represented groups and women.  The third area lies in helping students learn about the international dimension of science through a student exchange with one of the world's leading bioelectrochemistry laboratories at Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK.",

The structures used to handle these samples were of nanometer dimensions in either 2 (1-D nanostructures) or all 3 (0-D nanostructures) dimensions, and electrodes capable of carrying out electron transfer reactions were built into them.  The simplest structures were constructed as two-electrode 0-D reactors for highly sensitive chemical analysis.  By incorporating two electrodes into a nanopore with a volume of a billionth of a billionth of a liter, molecules could be passed back and forth between the electrodes very rapidly, allowing the same molecule to be measured many times before it finally escaped the pore by diffusing out the top, thus greatly enhancing the sensitivity.  This approach to nanometer scale electrochemistry was shown to enhance the sensitivity of electrochemical measurements and in some cases to help with selectivity, i.e. discriminating the desired signal against a background of unwanted interfering molecules.  Another set of electrochemical reactors were fashioned from 1-D nanostructures which allowed a very useful kind of coupling between fluid flow and surface electrochemical reactions.

In fact, electrons can move from one side of the wire to the other at a rate limited only by the intrinsic quantum properties of the electrons themselves.
