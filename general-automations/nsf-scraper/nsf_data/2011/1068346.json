 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, called MSEED, is increasing the number of STEM graduates in Northwest Indiana.  Students earn a bachelor's degree in science or mathematics, as well as teacher licensure within four years.  They participate in a significant undergraduate research component, curriculum development training, faculty mentoring and an immersive teaching experience in diverse communities.  These strategies are designed to improve retention and to produce effective teachers who possess a firm understanding of the scientific method.  High quality math and science teaching is an important factor in increasing student achievement and promoting career exploration in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe program recruits from and interacts with high-need and high-poverty areas of Northwest Indiana.  MSEED graduates are professional educators who effectively teach and motivate students.  It is expected that each of  these teachers will have a positive influence on 150 secondary students each year.  Project activities are assessed for efficacy as well as a longitudinal study of the future high school teachers' effectiveness.",
