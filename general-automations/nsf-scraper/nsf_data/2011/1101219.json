All of the topic areas cited in the proposal are central to analysis and extremely active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities, especially in the mini-courses that will be offered by Jeff McNeal and Loredana Lanzani.",
