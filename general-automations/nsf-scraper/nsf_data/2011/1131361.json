 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced technologies such as microelectromechancial systems (MEMS) devices, suffer considerably from friction and adhesion due to the large surface to volume ratios of their components, limiting their practical applications.  The goal of this grant is to develop molecular based approaches for lubrication schemes to address these challenges and advance the fundamental understanding of lubrication in MEMS.  Mixed monolayer films proffer the potential of providing modest friction modification, with integrated molecules that can also function as mobile lubricant phases under contact.  In this grant we will explore how mixed monolayer systems can be exploited to solve key issues in the lubrication of MEMS devices through the precise control of surface interactions by systematically tuning surface chemical composition.  These fundamental experimental studies are paired with molecular dynamics simulations of the contacts, as well as large scale tribometry measurements to allow us to explore these phenomena over a range of length scales (nm ? \u00ecm) and timescales (ps ? s).  New techniques for exploring the asperity-asperity contacts that dominate microdevices, using tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), will also be developed, where friction/adhesion and the corresponding local chemical changes at interfaces will be probed concomitantly.\r\n\r\nIf these studies are successful, the development of mixed monolayer schemes for MEMS devices may enable active device technologies to reach production status.  The students working on this project (both graduate and undergraduate) will receive multidisciplinary training in materials science, engineering, and surface chemistry and physics, developing proficiency in multiple arenas, preparing them for the advanced technology workforce.  Aspects of the work will also be incorporated as demonstrations for elementary school students in our Science and Engineering Open House.  Collaborative interactions with the University of Florida and Sandia National Labs will also allow students to conduct research in both fundamental and applied settings, as well as both government and academic labs.",

Understanding these processes impacts a key element of the US and world economy, as control of friction and wear can lead to substantial energy savings.  The energy losses through these processes in the US alone are estimated at 1% of the GDP.  Thus, developing new approaches and fundamental technologies to control friction and wear can have a significant impact on US energy independence and sustainability. To address these fundamental questions a combination of experimental methods and computational models were developed specifically to examine how energy is dissipated, and how wear can be mitigated, in the nanoscopic asperity-asperity contacts that dominate the interactions of machined interfaces in sliding contact.  The experimental studies included the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to explore friction and adhesion on model surfaces, where surface roughness was controlled through the use of silica nanoparticles to create surfaces which mimic the nanoscopic asperities in real machined interfaces, but provides a controlled approach to their study.   Here the frictional properties of self-assembled monolayers of organosilanes bonded to these surfaces were examined, and compared to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the asperity-asperity contacts to allow for a complete picture of the energy dissipation pathways to be understood.  We also expanded these studies to include investigations of the frictional properties of graphene on these rough surfaces as a means of controlling friction on the atomic scale.  Graphene is a honey-combed network of carbon atoms, only a single atomic layer in thickness, which has been shown to dramatically decrease friction when applied to a surface.  From our initial work here, we have been able to show how graphene bonds to surfaces with nanoscopic roughness and how this influences its frictional properties.  Here the key finding was that a balance of surface bonding with the shear stain at the outermost interface is required for graphene to be an effective solid state lubricant.  The simulation tools that we developed advanced the approaches that had been used previously, by allowing  the results of the simulations to be directly compared to standard continuum contact mechanics models and provided a means to map out the atomic interactions within the contacts. Importantly, the pairing of these fundamental experimental studies with the molecular dynamics simulations of the nanoscopic contacts, proffers a route to design interfaces to lower friction and resist wear. \n\nBeyond the research activities support by the grant, students participating in this project have received cross-disciplinary education and training in areas of materials science and engineering, surface chemistry, mechanics, nanoscience and nanotechnology.  Such broad training diversifies student backgrounds preparing them for US initiatives in high technology, with students supported from this work going on to take positions in academia (Harvard University and University of Central Oklahoma) as well as in the technology sector (Intel Corporation).

Here use of our atomic force microscope (AFM) linked to a hands free interface using a leap motion controller, allowed children to \"paint\" nanoscale patterns on a surface using just a wave of their hand. This demo was termed \"The Atomic Canvas\" to illustrate how nanoscale scale structures could be fabricated from the atomic scale on up using nanolithography, while also demonstrating the tools needed ..."
