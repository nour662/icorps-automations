 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the precise analytic form of the complex singularities of\r\nthe Lorenz system, the figure-eight solution of the three-body problem, and signals obtained\r\nfrom the Navier-Stokes boundary layer. Both analytic and numerical techniques\r\nwill be used. Research on the Lorenz system has the aim of understanding the analytic\r\ncontinuation of the Lorenz solutions to the entire complex plane. With regard to the\r\nfigure-eight solution, the project will show that the complex singularities of this system\r\nhave an appealingly simple structure. The Navier-Stokes boundary layer has been\r\nstudied primarily using techniques from spectral analysis. We will locate and elucidate\r\nsingularities of the analytic continuation of the signal in the complex plane, and and\r\nobtain a measurement as well as an understanding of the time scales imposed by the\r\nouter flow.\r\n\r\nThis project endeavors to benefit the public in two respects. Firstly, we aim to obtain\r\nnew insights into the Navier-Stokes boundary layer which is of immense importance in\r\nengineering and meteorology. As an example of its importance, we mention that a\r\nmajor part of the energy intake of automobiles is dissipated in the boundary layer.\r\nSecondly, we will write a new book that puts computer architecture at the heart of\r\nscientific computing. This book will introduce a style of scientific computing that is\r\ndeeply informed by recent progress in computer architecture to a wider audience.",
