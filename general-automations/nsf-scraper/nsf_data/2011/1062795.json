 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program in the Physics Department at the University of Washington. The program offers a broad selection of student projects from many sub-fields of physics, for ten weeks of summer research. It makes use of the University of Washington's strong in-house \"table-top\" experimental programs; its outstanding machine-shop facilities including a first-rate student shop; CENPA, a DOE center-of-excellence in nuclear physics and astrophysics; and theory opportunities ranging from the Institute for Nuclear Theory to a twenty-teraflop local cluster. Each student participant will be partnered with a UW faculty advisor. Most Physics faculty members participate as advisors, as do selected faculty from affiliated departments. Student work includes: design, construction, and commissioning of instrumentation; data collection and analysis; numerical modeling; the development of software for such modeling; and theory. A variety of social activities that allow students to see the Seattle area and to interact with other students are also planned.",
