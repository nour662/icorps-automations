 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  PI proposes to investigate the large scale geometry of negatively curved spaces by using quasiconformal analysis on metric spaces.  The proposed research includes  large scale geometry of solvable groups, metric structure on the boundary of relatively hyperbolic groups, and quasiisometric rigidity of Hadamard manifolds.  The proposed research  on solvable groups  involves the study of quasiconformal analysis on  nilpotent Lie groups. Although the metrics on the nilpotent Lie groups are not Riemannian, they are left invariant and admit a one-parameter family of dilations.   They include Carnot metrics and also many other metrics.    Stated in the language of quasiconformal analysis, some of the goals are:  to classify  these nilpotent Lie groups up to quasiconformal equivalence; to show that (in most cases) every quasiconformal map is biLipschitz.  In terms of large scale geometry, the goal is to show that  quasiisometries between (most) negatively curved solvable Lie groups preserve distance up to an additive constant  and sometimes are    even  at a finite distance from isometries.   If  successful, this  research will lead to progress on the large scale geometry  of   finitely generated solvable groups. The proposed research on relatively hyperbolic groups will try to determine if there is a canonical quasiconformal structure on the boundary of relatively hyperbolic groups.   % and   the limit sets of geometrically finite groups. It would have applications to rigidity questions about these groups.  The proposed research about Hadamard manifolds concerns the question whether every quasiisometry between Hadamard manifolds is at a finite distance from a biLipschitz homeomorphism. The proposed projects on negatively curved solvable Lie groups and Hadamard manifolds  are  continuation of the PI's previous work on these topics. A common theme of these proposed   projects is the interplay  between geometry of negatively curved spaces  and  analysis  on the ideal boundary of these spaces.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research lies in geometric group theory and geometric analysis.  The questions in geometric group theory often concern the large scale properties of the spaces or maps, while in analysis the main focus is often the local properties. Surprisingly, these are related for spaces with negative curvature: a negatively curved space has an ideal boundary, and the large scale properties of the spaces are  encoded in the local structure of the ideal boundary. The PI proposes to study  the large scale properties of negatively curved spaces by  investigating the ideal boundary using  geometric analysis.",
