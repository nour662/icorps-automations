 "awd_abstract_narration": "Great earthquakes and tsunamis occur at subduction zones such as Sumatra, Japan, Peru-Chile, and Cascadia. The first three localities have been sites of recent events, while the third is expected to produce a great earthquake along the northwest coast of the U.S. at some time in the furture. The Hikurangi subduction system off North Island, New Zealand exhibits a range of slip conditions, from aseismic to strongly coupled, with strain release by coseismic, slow slip, and repeating microseismic events, but it has not been the site of a great M8+ earthquake, either because conditions here do not support such an event, or, more likely, because no large event has occurred since Europeans arrived there in the mid 19th century. Consequently, understanding seismicity in the Hikurangi subduction system is a matter of considerable societal relevance. Multi-disciplinary studies reveal the complex interplay between upper and lower plate structure, subducting sediment, thermal effects, regional tectonic stress regime, and fluid pressures to control the presence and distribution of the Hikurangi seismogenic zones. This study comprises a comprehensive seismological study of the southern Hikurangi system with the aim of characterizing its strongly coupled seismogenic zone and its downdip transition into an aseismic slow slip regime. In additional to its obvious societal relvance, the broader impacts of this study include cross-natioanl trianig of graduate students from the U.S., New Zealand and Japan, and a research experience for undergraduates.",

The cause of these earthquakes is similar to what caused the magnitude 9.3 earthquake at Sumatra in 2004 and the magnitude 9 earthquake at northern Japan in 2011 -- in plate tectonic terms an ocean plate descending under another plate that is a landmass. In North Island, the Pacific ocean plate 'subducts' beneath the Australian plate at a rate of about 42 km per million years. The behavior of the ocean plate to easily slide as it descends or to become stuck directly influences the buildup of stresses that eventually becomes relieved in the form of great earthquakes.  These great earthquakes take place at the boundary between the top of the descending plate and the overlying landmass. Where the depth of this boundary is close to the surface of the earth, the stronger the seismic waves created by a great earthquake will be felt at the surface of the earth. This is the case in New Zealand -- the Pacific plate beneath North Island is shallow and thus poses a seismic hazard to urban centers such as the capital city of Wellington.\n\nThis NSF project was one-third of an international collaboration with New Zealand and Japanese scientists to identify the geometry and depth of the Pacific ocean plate beneath North Island.  The overall study focused on the Wellington region of North Island and used seismology methods to probe into the North Island subsurface.  The international team installed seismometers at 900 sites coast-to-coast across the southern portion of North Island from the Pacific Ocean to the Tasman Sea.  Seismic waves were created using a dozen 500 kg explosions in order to produce after computer processing what is essentially an ultrasound of the earth.  This seismic ultrasound identified faults within the North Island crust and the shape of the descending Pacific plate.  This shape is being used by New Zealand scientists to estimate seismic hazards for Wellington and North Island. This NSF project provided overseas field experience to USA graduate students who also had opportunities to meet and interact with professors and other graduate students from New Zealand and Japan.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/21/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Okaya"
