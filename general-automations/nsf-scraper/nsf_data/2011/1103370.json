 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the U.S., individuals with disabilities continue to experience higher unemployment and underemployment and worse employment outcomes than individuals without disabilities. Research suggests self-employment can be a catalyst for improving these disparities. Many individuals with disabilities receive employment-related services, including support for self-employment, through vocational-rehabilitation (VR) agencies. The rate of self-employment cases successfully closed by VR across the country, however, has remained low for decades. Meanwhile, the globalized U.S. economy continues to evolve, as technological advancements and innovations redefine employment while creating new markets and business opportunities. Thus, the potential for more individuals with disabilities to become self-employed through VR and remain successful is compelling. Agencies will be challenged to adapt to these ongoing changes and find ways they can improve clients' self-employment opportunities and outcomes. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this postdoctoral project is in contributing new scientific knowledge to the fields of rehabilitation and special education. The extant research literature on self-employment of individuals with disabilities in the U.S. is currently still building an empirical foundation, which only began in the mid-1990s. A small number of studies tentatively suggest self-employment success for these individuals appears to be mostly influenced by individual characteristics, level of supports, and accountability systems. Further study is needed, however, to draw any valid conclusions. The Fellow will conduct a postdoctoral study on the role of VR in self-employment of individuals with disabilities in the U.S. by utilizing a mixed method of multilevel statistical modeling and qualitative phenomenological interviewing. Data will be obtained from the Rehabilitation Services Administration and Oregon Vocational Rehabilitation Services. Seven research questions will address the current state of self-employment of individuals with disabilities through VR, the individual and programmatic factors that explain whether clients reach successful case closure, and recent national and local trends. The combined scope and methodology of this project are also necessary precursors to designing and testing interventions in self-employment and, ultimately, deriving substantive theories.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this postdoctoral project include (a) improving VR services in self-employment and clients' outcomes through the use of research evidence; (b) motivating positive changes in VR agency policies at the county and state levels; (c) expanding employment opportunities and options to individuals with disabilities to support their goals for economic independence, self-determination, and self-worth; (d) raising the visibility of individuals with disabilities in self-employment to reduce long-held stereotypes and social stigma, and increase social integration; (e) cross training of VR counselors, education professionals, and members of the business community to increase their knowledge of issues and concerns unique to each respective profession and to reconcile competing professional interests; and (f) collaborating actively and regularly with university researchers, VR, and education professionals to advocate, develop, refine, and support STEM focused curricula and experiential learning opportunities for secondary students with disabilities in preparation for post-high school life and career.",
