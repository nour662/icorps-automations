 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at Texas A&M University-Commerce.   The site will recruit primarily from 2 year community colleges across the nation. This model addresses a national need, especially in rural areas, to support community college STEM majors as they make transitions to universities to complete their bachelor's degree in physical sciences.  During ten weeks each summer, ten REU students will engage in active research with TAMU-C research teams led by faculty members and may include research scientists, postdocs, graduate and senior undergraduate students resulting in publications in professional journals/meetings in physics and astronomy.   Projects will be available in five areas: Astronomy and Astrophysics, Nuclear and Particle Physics, Material Sciences, Computational and Mathematical Physics, and Engineering and Applied Physics.   This award is co-funded by the Division of Physics and the Division of Astronomical Sciences.",
