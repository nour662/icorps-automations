 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the recruitment and retention of women transferring from two-year colleges (TYC) into STEM majors at a top-tier women's liberal arts college, with scholarships replacing loans up to $8,800/year for each of the remaining two and a half years. The scholarship program nurtures these students by providing a structured intervention that (a) builds the scholars into a cohort, (b) draws them into the intellectual life of the college with intensive advising and a customized course taught by STEM faculty, and (c) leads them into the STEM community through career advising and structured guidance on securing internships and graduate school opportunities. The program is investigating those factors that influence recruitment and success of TYC college students in STEM disciplines at such a selective institution. \r\n\r\nOne of the project's broader impacts is to directly increase involvement of women (many first-generation or underrepresented students) in scientific research training. It is utilizing its ability to disseminate best practices for TYC STEM transfers among partner colleges in the local Five College consortium, statewide through the MA Board of Higher Education, and nationally through articles and conference presentations. Given the dearth of TYC transfer students attending selective institutions, this project is serving to increase participation and strengthen infrastructures for such partnerships across the nation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary goal of this project was to increase the number of women, particularly high-achieving community college students from modest socioeconomic backgrounds, transferring to a four-year institution and receiving their bachelor?s degree in a science or math discipline.\n\nOver forty percent of US undergraduates attend community college.  Community colleges are more racially, socioeconomically, and ethnically diverse than the four-year colleges and universities that grant bachelor?s degrees.  Smoothing the transfer pipeline from community college to a four-year institution would bring a bachelor?s degree into reach for people who are traditionally underrepresented in the science and math workforce:  women, minorities, and people from modest socioeconomic backgrounds.  The bachelor?s degree increases a person?s lifetime earning potential, especially in science and math disciplines, so helping more students achieve it would also begin to narrow the socioeconomic divide in the US.  In this project, faculty at a liberal arts women?s college (Mount Holyoke College) worked to scaffold success for incoming science and math community college transfers and support their progress toward a bachelor?s degree in the sciences and mathematics.\n\nStudents encounter many barriers in transfer from two-year to four-year institutions, from inadequate advising on needed courses, to social and cultural adjustments, to finding their footing in intermediate and upper-level science and math courses.  In our project we recruited high-achieving community college students to Mount Holyoke College and offered (a) transfer-specific orientation, (b) early academic advising from disciplinary insiders in the sciences and math, and (c) a one-credit transfer success course that supported the students as a cohort.  These initiatives, plus an NSF funded S-STEM scholarship, supported thirty community-college transfer students to Mount Holyoke over the life of the grant. \n\nWe complemented traditional student orientation with a transfer-specific orientation breakout session.  Here, new transfers in STEM met each other as well as experienced STEM transfers and supportive faculty.  They learned about the campus resources and the expectations faculty are likely to have of them in their courses.  This half-day orientation helped students recognize that they are part of a cohort of transfers in science and math, and can support each other.\n\nFor students with just two or three short years to complete the bachelor?s degree, high quality academic advising highlights a clear curricular path that helps a student make a strong start and push through to the bachelor?s degree.  The S-STEM grant enabled us to provide early academic major advising for the NSF S-STEM scholars, and gave us the evidence to show that it is important to offer this type of early advising to all STEM transfer students.  We now have discipline-specific faculty transfer advisors in all science and math departments at Mount Holyoke.\n\nA one-credit transfer success course supported incoming transfer students throughout their first semester at Mount Holyoke.  In the course, co-taught by a biologist and an educational psychologist, students learned about power dynamics in the classroom, the biology of stress, and the importance of the scientific literature as a way to enter the conversations between scientists. They learned to navigate the expectations of upper-level science and math courses.  They also received training in finding and funding internships.\n\nOver the life of the grant, these three initiatives (transfer-specific orientation, early academic advising, and a one-credit transfer success course), together with the NSF scholarship, supported 30 NSF S-STEM scholars at Mount Holyoke.  Twenty-seven of these women graduated or are on track to graduate with a bachelor?s degree in a STEM discipline.  Many are presently in graduate school or employed in STEM areas.  Moreover, many of the resources we developed for the NSF S-STEM scholars are benefitting all STEM transfers at our institution. \n\nThis work shows that excellent science and math undergraduates can come from a variety of backgrounds. Science and math disciplines are strengthened by the contributions of people who have historically had difficulty accessing high-level STEM training.  Women&mdash;many of them mothers, some of them women of color, all of them from modest financial backgrounds&mdash;have been encouraged and supported to enter positions of power and influence in the STEM workforce through this project.  They are also learning to mentor those who follow.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sarah Bacon"
