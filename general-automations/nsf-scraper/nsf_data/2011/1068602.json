 "awd_abstract_narration": "During development of a living organism, the production of the necessary proteins for specifying cell fates is governed by a network of interacting genes.  Mathematical models of these networks are necessary both for generating useful hypotheses for further experimentation.  This project addresses the question of what form such models should take, focusing on the paradigmatic case of the early stages of development of the sea urchin embryo.  The working hypothesis is that continuous-time Boolean models can efficiently account for three crucial features: the structure of the network, the logic carried out by each element, and the timing of activation events. The models allow the syntheses of results from multiple experiments and checks for consistency of interpretation, and reveals architectural features required for complex networks to perform given tasks.  A major goal of the project is to construct a network model, including inter-cell signaling, that accounts for the experimentally observed gene activity involved in creating the distinct tissues first formed in sea urchin embryos.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the mechanisms that determine what types of cells will be produced at different locations is central to the grand challenge of treating or preventing cancer as well as the science of embryonic development.  The mathematical modeling issues addressed in this project may find additional application in other systems in which independent agents sharply switch behaviors based on time--delayed information generated by other agents, such as neuroscience and traffic control.  The project directly provides training for graduate students in the rapidly emerging field of systems biology, where academic and industrial advances require a combination of mathematical and biological expertise.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA key challenge for understanding how cells in an embryo organize into distinct tissue types is the development of precise models that desribe the logic of gene regulation.  In order for the right genes to be turned on in the right cells, the cells send signals to each other that lead to activation or repression of certain critical genes.  Because all of the cells share the same basic instruction set, as encoded in their DNA, the information that causes different cell types to emerge must either be contained in the rules by which genes interact with each other or be controlled by some external influences.  This project brought together physicists and biologists to try to understand the mathematical structure of the regulatory network governing the expression of genes that control the development of distinct tissue types in the early stages of development of the sea urchin embryo.  \n\nThe primary result is a mathematical model that accounts for the pattern of cell fates generated in early sea urchin embryo.  Analysis of the model and comparison to available experimental data support the hypothesis that the production of the correct pattern of tissue specification at this stage of development (between the fourth and tenth cleavages in the urchin embryo) is controlled by a network of genes that carries out the same logic in every cell.  The pattern emerges due to the organization of three crucial features of the network: the set of links determing which genes affect the expression of which others; the logic determining whether a gene is turned on or off when its regulators are turned on; and the time lags associated with a regulator exerting its influence on each of its targets.\n\nIn order to build a mathematical model to describe the crucial elements of the gene regulatory network, we employed a framework -- called Autonomous Boolean Networks (ABN) -- in which genes are characterized as either \"on\" or \"off\" in each cell and influence each other through interactions that have specified time lags associated with them.  The project included demonstrations of the ability of these types of models to describe the behavior of more conventional models based on differential equations. The ABN framework was shown to provide mathematical insights into the behavior of a broad class of differential equation network models, including systems that show sustained oscillations. \n\nThe ABN framework was first used to model a single stage in the development of a fly embryo.  In that context, we showed that the model could account for the observed striped pattern and showed how the network could be understood to consist of an array of linked feedback loops, one type contained within each cell and one type  involving signals passed between neighboring cells.  \n\nOur work on the sea urching model revealed that the fundamental logic underlying the complex web of gene interactions leading to the formation of bands of three tissue types is as simple as it could possibly be.  We constructed the simplest network model that could possibly account for the process, then discovered that the basic structure of that model is mimicked by the real gene regulatory network.  \n\nThis project involved intensive collaboration between physicists and biologists.  The expertise required to construct the mathematical model and characterize its power and limitations had to be combined with the expertise required to interpret data from biological experiments.  Graduate and undergraduate students working on the project developed skills and knowledge in both areas.\n\nThe results of the project have been published in three peer reviewed papers and two PhD theses, and have been presented at national and international conferences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/09/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joshua E.
