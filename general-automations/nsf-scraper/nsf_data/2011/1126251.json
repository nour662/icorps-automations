 "awd_abstract_narration": "This MRI award provides funds to support the acquisition of a high performance computing system at Texas Southern University, a Historically Black University.   This acquisition will enable TSU faculty to pursue cutting edge research in the areas of computational material science, nano-science, quantum chemistry, electronic structure theory, strongly correlated plasma simulations, and the further development of robust tools and methods for parallel processing and distributed computing. This resource will be used directly in the research of faculty members from Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology and Computer Science. The computing system will also serve as a platform for promoting interdisciplinary collaboration across the campus and for opening new areas of research and research training.",
