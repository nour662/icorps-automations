 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to study a number of optimization models and algorithms \r\nthat are broadly useful in data dimension reduction, latent information extraction\r\nand hidden knowledge discovery. The focus is on problems involving low-rank \r\nmatrices of very large sizes, including the fundamental problem of computing \r\nprincipal singular value decompositions for unstructured dense matrices, as well as \r\n3D-image processing techniques with applications to hyperspectral data processing and \r\nwireless video networks.  The overall goal is to develop reliable algorithms that are \r\nmuch faster (by one order of magnitude or more on large problems) than those in use today. Since many of the proposed algorithms are extensions to the classic augmented Lagrangian alternating direction method (ALADM) originally designed for certain convex programs, a part of the project is devoted to a theoretical investigation on establishing a convergence theory for ALADM in more general settings.\r\n\r\nModern technologies, such as 4D CT-scans, satellite remote sensing and DNA microarrays, are creating an explosion of data made available in massive quantities and at fast rates. Mathematical and computational techniques play a crucial role in helping make sense out of such massive data sets in a timely fashion and with minimal human interventions. The PI's work involves studying and designing new algorithms for solving several classes of mathematical models designed to help discover and extract the most useful information buried or hidden in large amounts of data. New algorithms have the potential to run much much faster than today's state-of-the-art methods, thus providing more processing power and speed to numerous data-driven applications such as medical diagnoses, agriculture planning, environment surveillance or genetic research in biosciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nToday's technologies such as internet, medical imaging, hyperspectral remote sensing, DNA microarrays and various sensor networks are creating massive amounts of data on daily basis.  These data sets inevitably carry large mounts of redundancy.  Mathematical and computational techniques play a crucial role in extracting and understanding critical information or knowledge from such massive data sets.  Most mathematical and statistical models involved in data problems lead to so-called optimization models where one seeks to obtain an optimal solution with regard to a given criterion while imposing conditions to try to keep obtained solutions faithful to reality.  Therefore, the current data explosion situation creates high demands for efficient and reliable optimization algorithms and software tools that are also capable of handling larger and larger data sets. \n\n\nIn this project, the PI, with his collaborator and students, studied a diverse set of optimization models useful in data size reduction, data recovery, and knowledge extraction.  A common objective in these models is to remove less relevant or redundant data components from a large data set so that (a) the reduced data set retains the essential information but becomes more manageable, and (b) useful information is better exposed and represented.  In this project, studied problems include both generally applicable methodologies and some practical applications.  \n\n\nAt the conclusion of the project, several algorithms and software tools have been developed that proved to be more efficient and reliable at least in many cases than those previously available or in use by practicing scientists.  Based on works supported fully or in part by this project, eleven (11) journal papers have been published and four (4) software packages have been released.  For the sake of space, let us concentrate on two software packages and related papers.
