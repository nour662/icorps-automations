 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is the analysis of numerical schemes, and\r\nthe development of algorithms, to simulate materials which exhibit\r\nintricate rheological behavior or mechanical response due to their\r\nmicrostructural makeup. Examples include polymers, liquid crystals,\r\nand blood, whose elastic molecules or cells influence the macroscopic\r\nproperties at the macroscopic scale.  These materials are modeled by\r\nformidable systems of partial differential equations whose structural\r\nproperties capture important properties and physical principles, and\r\nit is important to develop numerical schemes to faithfully inherit\r\nthese. This project will bring together tools from partial\r\ndifferential equations, continuum mechanics, and numerical analysis,\r\nto analyze numerical schemes to simulate these systems. \r\n\r\nThe ability to simulate complex materials is a key technology required\r\nfor the design and development of many next generation products such\r\nas micro-mechanical devices, ink jets, bio-materials, solar energy\r\ndevices, and prosthetic organs.  Predicting material response is an\r\nessential tool needed to determine biological or physiological\r\nfunction; or to design and manufacture these materials; or for the\r\ndesign of the multitudes of devices which use their special\r\nproperties. The research proposed here will result in improved\r\nunderstanding of the mathematical models and the computational tools\r\nused to accomplish these tasks.",
