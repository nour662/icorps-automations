 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will use meta-analysis to synthesize the results of research comparing single-sex with coeducational schooling in regard to multiple student outcomes, focusing particularly on mathematics and science performance, interest, motivation, and attitude.  The investigators, from the University of Wisconsin and Arizona State University, will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis of research comparing student outcomes in single-sex and coeducation schooling in the US, and will conduct separate analyses of reseatch conducted in other countries.  Meta-analyses will focus on potential moderators of the effects such as dosage (e.g., single-sex classrooms vs. entire schools), quality of design (e.g., random vs. non-random assignment), gender, and others. Studies will be coded for multiple variables as determined by the Expectancy Value and Developmental Intergroup Theories.\r\n\r\nSingle-sex schooling is an important policy issue in mathematics and science education in the US today, but no broad meta-analysis has yet been conducted that examines the scientific evidence for or against this choice.  In drawing on a wide range of individua studies conducted both in the US and abroad, the investigators have the potential to provide definitive evidence to school districts as they make policy decisions about instituting single-sex education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main purpose of this project was to conduct a meta-analysis of research on the effects of single-sex schooling on students, for a wide array of ourcomes including math performance, math attitudes, school attitudes, gender stereotyping, self-concept, victimization, and body image.  Meta-analysis is a quantitative method for synthesizing the results of all prior studies of a question, in this case, the effects of single-sex schooling on students.  Meta-analysis leads to a higher standard of scientific evidence because it is based on many studies, not just a single study.  Educational policy decisions should be guided by the best available scientific evidence.  This meta-analysis was undertaken to provide that kind of evidence regarding single-sex schooling (i.e., boys-only or girls-only schools or classrooms).\n\nA second goal of the project was for a senior researcher (Hyde) to provide research mentoring to a junior researcher (Pahlke).  In this case, the goal was for Pahlke to learn how to conduct a meta-analysis.\n\nWe did conduct the meta-analysis and it was published in Psychological Bulletin in 2014.  We found that many of the studies on single-sex schooling (SS) had a methodological problem known as selection effects.  That is, students were not randomly assigned to SS or coed schooling as would be done in a proper experiment.  Instead, students and their parents selected SS or coed.  In many cases, the SS schools were more elite than the comparison schools, e.g., the students came from more affluent families.  If students in SS schools perform better, we can't know whether it is because of the SS school or because of the family advantages of the students.  We called studies with this design problem uncontrolled studies.  Nonetheless, we found a substantial group of high-quality controlled studies, which had either used statistical controls for selection effects or, in a few cases outside the U.S., students had been randomly assigned to SS or coed schooling.  The results from the controlled studies indicated no advantages to single-sex schooling, for boys or for girls, for outcomes such as math performance and science performance.\n\nIn addition, we conducted a study using data from South Korean middle-school students who had been randomly assigned to SS or coed schooling.  That study, too, found no advantages for SS schooling for either mathematics performance or science performance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Janet S Hyde"
