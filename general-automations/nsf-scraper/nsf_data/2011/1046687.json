 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the important problem of combating hospital acquired infections with the development of novel tissue matrices aimed at preventing nosocomial microbial infection.  The aim of this project is to combine antimicrobial nanomaterials and a natural dermis product to help prevent infections that occur during reconstructive surgeries.  This proof-of-concept study will develop methods for the production of uniform and conformal coatings on natural tissue matrices using layer-by-layer assembly of antimicrobial nanoparticles.  Importantly, this project will evaluate the efficacy of nanocoated natural dermis in eliminating or inhibiting bacterial growth in liquid and solid media.  In vitro studies also will be conducted to establish mammalian cell toxicity and viability of the engineered dermis in supporting mammalian cell growth.  Phase I results are expected to produce an optimized antimicrobial dermis scaffold that will be carried onto a focused Phase II evaluation in animal experimental wounds.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address the growing problem of hospital acquired infections from antibiotic resistant pathogens.  With nearly 1.7 million hospital-acquired infections and 99,000 deaths per year, increases in antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains represent a critical safety concern and a significant cost burden to our nation's health care system.  The proposed technology is a versatile option that provides a broad spectrum solution in combating bacterial infections and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance.  Furthermore, the methods used to characterize the proposed composite materials will add valuable insight into mechanisms associated with nanoparticle-derived antimicrobial activity, and will help guide future efforts in the arena of nanobiotechnology.",

This research and development project made use of a novel particle coating process to control the interface between the materials that make up the natural tissue matrix and several metal-based antimicrobial agents. The resulting composite materials displayed a high degree of antibacterial activity while preserving the base performance properties of the natural tissue, as assessed using both in vitro and in vivo experiments.  \n\nThe intellectual merit of this effort was two fold: (1) The methodology used to develop the antibacterial coatings allowed for the precise control over deposition of metal-based antimicrobial materials onto the surface of natural collagen matrices, which (2) allowed us to compare various metal-based antimicrobial coatings.  Through this NSF Phase 1 project, iFyber showed that copper is an effective antimicrobial agent, and that copper-tissue composite tissue matrices where more effective at killing bacterial pathogens than analogous silver-tissue composites -- silver is the current paradigm in metal-based antimicrobial care within the healthcare industry. \n\nThe broader impacts of the proposed project were realized in large part by the important market needs that the technology addresses.  A number of emerging trends in advanced wound care creates a significant market opportunity for iFyber.  As such, the outcomes of this Phase 1 research and development project have translated into three corporate funded development efforts for iFyber.\n\nIn general, the technology that was tested within this effort can address several key concerns articulated within the antimicrobial coatings segment of the regenerative medicine market; these include, increasing product safety concerns and the growing problem of hospital acquired infections from antibiotic resistant pathogens.
