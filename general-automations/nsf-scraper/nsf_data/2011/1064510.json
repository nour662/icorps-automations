The lectures are research talks at the cutting edge of the field, given by international experts.  The conferences will serve as a way to disseminate the latest research, and encourage interactions and collaborations among number theorists, leading to new ideas and interesting and useful research results in this important field of mathematics.  The conferences will give graduate students and postdocs the opportunity to interact with senior mathematicians from other institutions in academia, government, or industry.\r\n\r\nNumber theory is a central field of mathematics, that goes back to ancient times.  Modern day number theory builds on centuries of work in mathematics, to solve not only modern day problems but also difficult problems that remained unsolved for hundreds of years.  Number theory underpins the security of electronic commerce, and provides security for defense communications.",

The conferences also serve as a way to disseminate the latest research.  The conferences give the participants the opportunity to interact with scholars from other institutions, and the conferences give graduate students and postdoctoral scholars the opportunity to interact with senior mathematicians from other institutions in academia, government, and industry.
