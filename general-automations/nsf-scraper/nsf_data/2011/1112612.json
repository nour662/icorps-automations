 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project considers the fusion of two timely research topics: algorithms for compressed sensing and matrix completion, and their implementation using graphical processing units (GPUs). Compressed sensing is a relatively new paradigm in signal processing where the acts of acquiring a signal and compressing the measurements are combined into a single operation. The number of compressed measurements acquired is proportional to the information content of the signal rather than, as is traditional, equal to the ambient dimension of the signal.  Although the number of measurements is significantly reduced resulting in an undetermined system of equations, low-complexity greedy algorithms can be guaranteed to reconstruct an accurate approximation to the measured signal provided that the underlying signal was sparse, i.e. had only a few important components. Matrix completion similarly exploits the simplicity of the target matrix having only a few independent columns; in other words, one recovers a low rank matrix from a limited number of measurements. Typical applications include compressive radar, geophysical data analysis, medical imaging, and computer vision. The data sets from these applications are typically, however, at least an order of magnitude beyond the currently available simulation levels.  By employing the computational power of GPUs this project provides a platform for overcoming computational barriers and the necessary large-scale testing on problems up to three orders of magnitude beyond current empirical testing regimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraditionally, a signal is measured by acquiring every component in the signal and then compressing the signal with an appropriate computational algorithm.  For example, digital cameras capture an image with a huge number of pixels and then a compression scheme such as JPEG is used to reduce the size of the digital image for storage or dissemination.  In many cases, the costs and challenges associated with taking measurements are considerable.  In compressed sensing and matrix completion, the measurement process is altered in order to reduce the number of measurements but the signal reconstruction process is necessarily more difficult.  Compressed sensing and matrix completion transfer the workload from the measurement process to computational resources dedicated to the signal reconstruction.  A typical example in medical imaging is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) where the time required to obtain a diagnostic level MRI causes unnecessary discomfort for patients and even pediatric sedation.  Compressed sensing MRI has demonstrated the ability to produce diagnostic caliber images in a fraction of the time.  The increased computational burden requires fast, efficient algorithms and many such algorithms have been introduced or updated for compressed sensing.  The observed performance of these algorithms is substantially superior to their pessimistic theoretical guarantees, but testing of these algorithms has been constrained by their imposed computational burden. In this project, the PI and collaborators  develop software capable of providing near real-time signal reconstruction from compressed measurements through development of new techniques, and by exploiting the computational performance gains offered by new architectures with graphical processing units. The resulting software validation is aimed to provide practioners with guidance on algorithm choice most appropriate to the application.  Undergraduate students at the PI's institution have the opportunity to participate in the PI's research  and are exposed to the challenges presented, but gains to be achieved, when exploiting new scientific computing architectures.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "In  traditional signal processing, every component of the signal is  acquired through a direct measurement; the resulting measurements are  then compressed for storage or dissemination, and the signal is then  reconstructed when needed.  The main workload of  traditional signal processing is in the acquisition of the measurements,  while the compression and reconstruction phases are straightforward.  In  compressed sensing, the information content of the signal is acquired  through far fewer, though more complicated, measurements which results  in an already compressed version of the signal.  In  this case, the reconstruction process is substantially more  complicated, and the workload is transferred from the measurement phase  to the signal reconstruction phase. Similarly, matrix completion studies  the art of reconstructing a multi-dimensional signal from a limited  number of measurements.  Typical applications of  compressed sensing and matrix completion include medical imaging through  magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, radar imaging,  geophysical data analysis, astronomical imaging, facial recognition,  survey completion, and computer vision.\nThe  theory of compressed sensing has determined suitable measurement  schemes and algorithms for signal reconstruction from the compressed  measurements. Existing theory is rather pessimistic in order to ensure  that the sensing and reconstruction process is successful on all  signals.  The typical signal in an application is  unlikely to be adversarial to the measurement and reconstruction  processes so that the average case performance of the algorithms is  critically important.  Furthermore, the  computational resources required to complete the reconstruction of the  signals had previously limited empirical investigations of the  algorithms in problem dimensions that are typical in applications.  Projects funded by this grant improved computational efficiency of a  class of algorithms including improved subroutines for implementation,  investigated the algorithms? average case performance to help  practitioners appropriately select algorithms for applications, employed  the lessons learned from the algorithm comparisons to develop a  superior algorithm which exploits the advantages from various  algorithms, and extended the results to the matrix completion and  row-sparse approximation problems.  Through this award, the PI mentored twelve undergraduate students in five research projects which led to three peer reviewed journal articles, two software releases, and two continuing projects.  All twelve of these students are either in the process of applying to graduate school, attending graduate school, or pursuing careers in computationally intensive fields.\n\n \nAccelerated Algorithms on GPUs.  Massive  parallelization of greedy algorithms for compressed sensing was  achieved through designing algorithms which exploit the energy  efficient, low cost, many core architecture of high performance  computing graphics processing units (GPU).  More  computationally efficient subroutines were specifically tailored for  parallelization to further reduce signal reconstruction cost. This  algorithm development and implementation spawned research projects on  fundamental order statistic selection algorithms for GPUs; these  projects included undergraduate research collaborators.\nAlgorithm  Performance Comparisons. The GPU accelerated algorithms enabled large  scale testing of greedy algorithms on problem dimensions previously  unavailable in the literature.  These comparisons indicate for practitioners which algorithms are best suited for a given application.  Furthermore,  the ability to investigate more realistic problem dimensions provided  new insight into the efficacy of compressed sensing algorithms when very  few measurements are available.\nAlgorithm  Development. From the lessons learned during empirical testing, the PI  and collaborators exploited the advantageous aspects of existing  algorithms to develop Conjugate Gradient Iterative Hard Thresholding  (CGIHT).  This research track produced a  theoretically sound algorithm which is superior to the previously  existing algorithms in terms of speed of signal reconstruction and  stability to measurement noise. The theoretical guarantees for CGIHT were extended to the matrix completion and row sparse approximation  problems.  In another project, the PI and  undergraduate collaborators extended several known compressed sensing algorithms  to the row sparse approximation problem, established theoretical  guarantees for successful signal reconstruction, and empirically established  average case performance characteristics for these algorithms.  Additionally, this award funded a project which precisely established  how the rank of a row sparse matrix improves the reconstruction  capability for two greedy algorithms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey Blanchard"
