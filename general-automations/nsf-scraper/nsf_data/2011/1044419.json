 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing four undergraduate chemistry courses into a blended curriculum structure that revises the role of the teaching laboratory.  The course sequence moves students from verification experiments to open-ended inquiry activities in order to provide students with a more genuine scientific research experience during their first two years of college.  The courses include frequent and sustained use of instrumentation ordinarily used in research settings, including a graphite furnace atomic absorbance instrument, a high performance liquid chromatography instrument, and a gas chromatography instrument.  The model includes co-enrollment of students from the first and third courses, as well as from the second and fourth courses, in order to build a community of practitioners who work together to solve related problems.  The expectation is that these pedagogical approaches, when brought together, bring students to a greater awareness of what it means to participate in science, to do research, and to think independently and critically about the world around them. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe project is transforming the design of undergraduate laboratory experiences.  The collection of data is designed to demonstrate whether this approach achieves the expected efficacy and benefits of establishing the community of learners in laboratory, and to test whether students who experience authentic experimentation earlier in their academic training persist in science career trajectories. The model combines proven elements of best practices in STEM education in a novel way that has not been previously tested.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe dissemination plan includes workshops designed to convey the model to STEM departments at other institutions. The model is expected to be portable to mid-sized institutions with research active faculty and to other STEM disciplines, thus potentially affecting all science majors. Students who experience the model may possess stronger problem solving, critical thinking, and laboratory skills when entering graduate study or the scientific workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch in the basic sciences and technology provides many outcomes important to society.  Many of the new devices that we enjoy on a daily basis are the result of inspired work done by individuals with a fascination for science-oriented ideas and a motivation to explore the potential for those ideas.  At public institutions like South Dakota State University it is our goal to provide citizens with the opportunity to develop that fascination and motivation.  The funds provided by this grant have helped the Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry to enhance opportunities for various personnel as they engage in work to change what we know and how we explore ideas.\n\n \n\nThe first major outcome of this work was the development of a learning community for chemistry &amp; biochemistry majors that did not previously exist.  Students majoring in chemistry &amp; biochemistry are now given opportunities from their first moment on campus to become involved in a community that supports their interest in chemistry or biochemistry.  The initial sequence of laboratory courses in which new students enroll involves collaborative work with students from the previous year\u00c6s cohort.  This collaboration allows older students to support the new students as they became accustomed to their new environment on campus, specifically within the Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry.  Through this new sequence of courses, new students are also provided the opportunities to meet faculty, post-doctoral associates, graduate students and other undergraduate students in the department and gain a sense of belonging.  Through these collaborations they learn about research that is being done on campus and they build a confidence to become involved in that work.  The importance of this community can best be described by the reaction of chemistry &amp; biochemistry undergraduate students for the program.  They recognized how important it was to be supported and they offered voluntary assistance in tutoring the new students in their courses.  We did not include this in the initial plan for this work, but quickly welcomed it as part of the new learning community.\n\n \n\nThe essence of this new learning environment was the collaboration between first and second year chemistry &amp; biochemistry students.  However, in order for this to occur a new curriculum for this type of activity was required.  The principle investigators were given the opportunity through grant resources to creatively change the first and second year laboratory experience.   Laboratory curricula were developed to engage students between courses.  Those in the first year course were required to work with those in the second year course.  To make this connection, the principle investigators created a series of laboratory experiments promoting skills within each course but asking questions requiring collected data from all students in both courses.  We believe that this type of curriculum could be developed between courses, not just in chemistry &amp; biochemistry, but also between courses across disciplines.  This type of cross-disciplinary curricular development would provide opportunities for students to gain experience combining ideas not from just one discipline like chemistry, but from others such biology, engineering, English, sociology, and more.  The ability to be motivated to develop new ideas is not located within just the sciences but is a cross-disciplinary skill which needs to be nurtured.     \n\n \n\nA final outcome was the investment into the infrastructure of the Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry.  Public institutions must provide opportunities to learn about and work with the latest devices within a discipline.  In chemistry &amp; biochemistry this means using the latest instrumentation for research.  Through funding provided by this grant the Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry at South Dakota State University upgraded instrumentation and the first year students h..."
