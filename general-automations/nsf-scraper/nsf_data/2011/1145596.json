 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops unified cognitive network management architecture for end-to-end application-oriented quality of service (QoS) provisioning in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks. The core of the architecture is a unified cross-layer controller, which has two control plans: vertical nodal control plan and horizontal network control plan. The nodal cross-layer optimized resource allocation is guided by the control policy dynamically generated by horizontal network control based on a cognitive agent network, and thus leads to a multi-scale cross-layer architecture for distributive and autonomous application-oriented QoS provisioning for future cognitive radio networks. The transformative significance is two-fold. First, characterizing and understanding the end-to-end network behaviors of cognitive radio networks is of major fundamental research interest. Second, cognitive network management is a technique to implement end-to-end application-oriented QoS provisioning under various randomness and uncertainty in cognitive radio networks. \r\n\r\nThis project provides solutions for a variety of domain-specific applications while addressing future societal needs.  By using cognitive network management to implement end-to-end application-oriented QoS provisioning under various randomness and uncertainty in cognitive radio networks, this project benefits other kinds of networks such as the 3G/4G mobile networks, and WLAN/WMAN/WWAN. The research findings will be integrated into networking courses. Research results will be disseminated in journals and conferences.",
