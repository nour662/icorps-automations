 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international community Open Science Conference (OSC) that will be held in conjunction with the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR) XXXII meeting scheduled for July 13?25, 2012 in Portland, OR. The overarching theme of the OSC is to address the current status and future prospects of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean sciences and help developing scientific capacity in the SCAR member countries, emerging national and international Antarctic programs, students and early career scientists. The United States has as an important role today in setting the agenda and carrying it forward as it has had in past decades. The NSF's Office of Polar Programs, NRC's Polar Research Board, U.S. delegation to SCAR, and individual research scientists all participate in that effort. The SCAR/OSC provides an exceptional platform for information sharing and networking among the diverse and disparate U.S. and international Antarctic science communities. The location of the meeting in North America promises to attract the largest U.S. scientists' participation in the meeting's history.",
