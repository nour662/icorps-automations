 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galactic winds transfer plasma, magnetic fields, and energetic particles from galaxies into their surrounding halos and to the intergalactic medium, and influence the star formation rate in galaxies. Hot gas, cool gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic fields are observed components that are circulated. In some galaxies with relatively high star-formation rates, hot gas seems to be pushing the cool gas outward over scales many times the size of the host galaxy. However, it is not clear how much matter in the halo will escape the galaxy's gravity, and how much matter will fall back to impact the galaxy. Analytic models for the hot-gas component of outflows usually consider only a free-streaming, constant velocity outflow, or perhaps radiation pressure, but gas-driving effects from large-scale thermal-pressure, cosmic-ray pressure and magnetic fields, or galactic rotation are not always included. This project aims to better understand how the presence of cool gas influences the thermal and ram-pressure driven winds from galaxies. This work builds a semi-analytic model for the outflow dynamics of components that includes cool gas, hot gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic fields. The model predictions are then compared to observations of cool gas kinematics in the halos of galaxies. Overall, this will improve our understanding of wind dynamics, and provide an estimate for the fraction of gas that escapes a variety of galaxies. \r\nThe results have applications in the interpretation of observations and theoretical simulations in other astrophysical fields where knowledge about mass- and energy loss rates of galactic winds is important to understand other galactic properties such as the energy balance within galaxies and in the intergalactic medium. This project offers two different theoretical studies for student participation, one concentrating on predicting cool-cloud kinematics, and one predicting the observable absorption patterns stemming from variety of wind models.",
