 "awd_abstract_narration": "This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) projects engages undergraduate students in an intensive six-week research program in Mexico, with the overarching goal of enhancing students' research skills and cultural literacy in an internationally emerging field of engineering.  Under the mentorship of Drs. Neale Smith and Beatriz Murrieta Cort\u00e9s of the  Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM), six U.S. students per year will investigate radio-frequency identification (RFID) applications in health care, aerospace manufacturing environments, and inter-modal and warehousing logistics.  Specific research themes include security and inventory control in hospital settings, real-time adjustments of the supply chain in aerospace manufacturing facilities, and tracking the delivery of products from supplier to customer in multistep transportation systems.  Students will also be involved in pre-trip and on-site orientations, a research methods seminar focusing on the Design for Six Sigma (DFSS-R) approach, graduate student development seminars, and oral and written presentations.  Spanish language instruction and cultural activities will also be an integral part of the program.\r\n\r\nThis international research collaboration brings together researchers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and ITESM, along with industry partners such as the Hospital San Jos\u00e9, Bombardier, and Werner Global Logistics.  UNL will recruit a diverse group of undergraduate students to participate, with strong representation of women and underrepresented minorities.  Results from the experience will be shared by students and faculty at educational conferences, through annual reports, and the program website. This partnership will also allow the further testing of models and innovations that have significant practical implications for U.S. - Mexico trade.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).",

Establishing these institutions as IRES sites that allowed this program to foster multiple exposures to a different, emerging culture of the American continent.  15  students in the sciences (14 engineering students and 1 nursing  student) over the course of 3 years, worked with 6 international  companies.  5 female engineering students participated, and 7 people from underepresennted groups were involved.\n\nThe specific outcomes of this IRES Program were: \n1.  Enhance      students\u00c6 research skills and facilitate cross-cultural research      opportunities in internationally emerging engineering fields of study      under the mentorship of a faculty researcher.  \nThe results included 6 research reports presented in English and Spanish to the 6 international companies and international faculty. \n2. Increase      students\u00c6 comfort level when working with people from different cultures by      exposing them to the technological, economic, and socio-political aspects of      Mexican society.\n3.   Increase      students\u00c6 awareness of cultural differences by fostering  their interest in      and knowledge of a variety of cultural  perspectives. We seek to provide an      environment in which students  actively learn how to collaborate in global,      cross-cultural  settings. \n\nThe results included students completing a Spanish course in Mexico and received certification from a recognized University in Mexico.  These students went on trips and participated in programs with the study abroad groups in Mexico. \n4.  Become familiar      with the Spanish language to increase effectiveness when working with      others from Spanish-speaking cultures.\n5. Increase      student abilities in research methods and problem-solving skills that will      make them competitive in an international research environment. The activity      is expected to have the additional benefit of increasing the student\u00c6s      interest in graduate school.\nThe results included student presenting their research projects in the Spanish the native language of the companies employees.  This spanish was learned over the 6 week period as the students took Spanish classes at the hosted Mexico University.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe intellectual focus of this project is to provide an opportunity for future engineers to conduct international research in relevant fields of study under the direction of a faculty mentor. Exposing students to research discovery in the increasingly important research areas of logistics, transportation, and RFID automatic data capture, which by their definition have vital international components. The natural integration of an international experience will allow students to gain cultural exposure, language training, and global research perspectives of different and diverse people, ultimately broadening their worldview. \n \nThis project allows educators to prepare the next generation of engineers by exposing students to different cultures prior to entering the workforce &ndash; an activity that aligns with the NSF mandate to better prepare \"future generations of U.S. scientists and engineers to gain professional experience beyond the United States' borders early in their careers.\"\n \nAs mentioned in Thomas Friedman\u00c6s The World is Flat, international understanding is pivotal to the nation\u00c6s development and future expansion of the U.S. economy (2005).
