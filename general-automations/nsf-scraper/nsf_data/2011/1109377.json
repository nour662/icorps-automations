Dr. Tysoe and his students will explore oxidative reaction pathways on model gold-palladium alloy catalysts, using a combination of surface science spectroscopic probes and computational modeling of the reaction processes.  The work focuses on developing a molecular level understanding of reaction pathways for vinyl acetate monomer synthesis, direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis, and CO and alcohol oxidation reactions.  The nature of the surface oxygen displaying catalytic activity will be probed in these studies.  Fundamental insights obtained in these studies will aid in the design and development of active catalysts for commercial application.  The work also provides a training ground for students in this technologically important field.  Women and underrepresented minority students make up a large portion of the research team.",
