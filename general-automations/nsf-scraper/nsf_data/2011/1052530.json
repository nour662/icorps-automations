 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The aim of the project is to understand the mechanism by which plant cells\r\nstart the process of making proteins.  The model plant, Arabidopsis, provides excellent genetic tools to dissect the role of various cellular components in this process during normal plant growth and development as well as under a variety of environmental stresses such as changes of temperature, drought, or infection by plant pathogens. Although the mechanism of protein synthesis in plants is similar to that of animals or insects, some aspects are unique to plants.  Many of these differences may be related to the fact that plants must interact with the environment while remaining in a single place and must obtain their energy through photosynthesis. A variety of genetic and biochemical tools will be applied to determine the specialized nature of how plant cells synthesize proteins.  Biochemical and phenotypic analysis of T-DNA mutants of initiation factors eIF4G, eIFiso4G1 and eIFiso4G2 will be carried out, as well as analysis using tagged proteins (regulated by both native and CaMV 35S promoters) in various plant backgrounds.  Environmental stressors (light, heat, cold, hormones, redox, etc.) will be applied to determine if any of the mutant or transgenic plants display phenotypes associated with particular stresses.   Changes in protein expression will be assessed in the various mutants and transgenic expression lines and any proteins with altered expression will be identified.  Several methods will be utilized to further identify any mRNA targets that are reduced on polysomes in the T-DNA knockout mutants for eIFiso4G1, eIFiso4G2 or eIF4G or that associate directly with these proteins or complexes.  Those mRNAs identified from DNA array analysis of polysomes from mutant plant lines will be validated using using in vitro translation assays dependent upon the presence of eIFiso4F and confirmation by qRT-PCR of reduced polysome loading of the mRNAs in the mutant plant lines.  Further validation will be done using in vivo expression of tagged versions of the identified mRNA?s coding region in plants lacking one or more of the genes for the subunits eIFiso4F.  The mRNAs will also be used as ?bait? to pull down and identify additional RNA binding proteins.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact.   High school, community college, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students will be involved in this research project.  Undergraduates will enter through the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI), a unique program at the University of Texas at Austin for training students in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines.  Beginning students will be taught the necessary skills to engage productively in research and will learning science by participation. The students in the FRI will be responsible for construction of in vitro expression clones for the mRNAs, construction of plasmids for over-expression of proteins and tagged proteins in plants and will be involved in the phenotype analysis of mutant plant lines.  In addition to training future research scientists, this project will lead to new information about how plant cells make proteins.  This knowledge may be applied to improve plants to better resist environmental insults or virus infection and to provide better quality protein for food for humans and livestock.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur long-term research goal is to understand the interactions between mRNAs and translation initiation factors that influence gene expression in plants.  Plants lack some of the well-characterized mammalian mechanisms for regulation of gene expression and thus may have evolved novel systems for this purpose due to their stationary life style and ability for photosynthesis and other plant specific functions.  All eukaryotic organisms have messenger RNA that have a 7-methyl guanosine \"cap\" at the 5' end of the mRNA and a cap-binding protein complex, initiation factor eIF4F (eIF4F). This laboratory discovered the presence of a novel form of the mRNA cap binding complex in plants, called eIFiso4F, in addition to the eIF4F form found in other eukaryotes.  The plant specific cap-binding complex is similarly comprised of a large subunit (eIFiso4G) and a cap-binding protein (eIFiso4E) as eIF4F (comprised of eIF4G and eIF4E).  The absence of the plant specific complex results in plants that are slow growing, smaller and have deformed chloroplasts.  In contrast, the absence of the eIF4F complex has little outward phenotype.  Our research so far indicates that eIFiso4F complexes are required for optimal translation of least one subset of mRNAs for photosynthetic proteins that are nuclear encoded.  It is likely other mRNAs may require eIFiso4F for optimal translation during development or duress given the strong phenotype of plants lacking this factor.   Plants have large fluctuations in the redox state of the cell in response to photosynthesis and other biotic or abiotic stresses suggesting a need for a rapid and redox-sensitive mechanism to regulate the translation of proteins.  This laboratory identified a pair of cysteine residues present in both plant eIF4E and eIFiso4E that are unique to the plant kingdom.  It is hypothesized that the ability to make such a disulfide bond may affect the ability of these cap-binding proteins to interact with mRNAs to promote or inhibit translation.   During the grant period many undergraduates participated in the research through the Freshman Research Imitative (FRI).  The FRI engages students early in their college careers with research to promote an understanding of how research works and to give students experience at the bench in cutting edge research and technologies as freshmen.  Many of these students have gone on to graduate school due to their early exposure to the excitement of research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/23/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen S Browning"
