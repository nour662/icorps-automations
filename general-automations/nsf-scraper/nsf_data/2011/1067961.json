 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RUI award funds the research activities of Professor Stephen G. Naculich at Bowdoin College.\r\n\r\nSupersymmetry is a mathematical symmetry that relates bosons, or particles with integer spin, to fermions, or particles with half-integer spin. Since its original mathematical formulation in the early 1970's, supersymmetry has played a significant role in numerous branches of high-energy physics and string theory. Indeed, most of the major advances that have occurred in understanding the properties of difficult strongly-coupled systems have occurred when these systems are analyzed in a supersymmmetric context. Supersymmetry also plays an integral role in string theory, and it is still an open question whether string theories are consistent without supersymmetry.  In this project, Professor Naculich aims to study the connections between supersymmetric field theories and string theory. Specifically, he proposes to focus on both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of supersymmetric gauge theory and supergravity theory, as illuminated by their connection to string theory through Dirichlet-branes (D-branes) and the AdS/CFT correspondence.\r\n\r\nThe research is also envisioned to have several broader impacts. The insights gained, which will be disseminated through journal publications, seminars, and conference proceedings, will contribute to better control over higher-loop effects of gauge theories. This is essential to understanding the predictions of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), as well as to a deeper and more fundamental understanding of string theory. Because this project integrally involves undergraduate participation, it will also contribute to the education of undergraduates by providing training in quantum mechanics, group theory, and field theory, and exposure to research methods in theoretical physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant has supported research that is part of an on-going effort by the world-wide community of theoretical elementary particle physicists to develop mathematical models to explain the nature and behavior of the smallest constituents of matter (elementary particles).  More specifically, this research has aimed at achieving a deeper understanding of, and at developing more efficient mathematical tools for calculating the predictions of, existing models of quarks and gluons called \"gauge theories.\"  A second goal of this research has been to demonstrate the existence of heretofore unexpected links between gauge theories on the one hand, and theories that describe the behavior of gravitons, the particles responsible for the force of gravity, on the other.\n\nOne of the goals in studying these models is to calculate \"scattering amplitudes\" which are used to find the probabilities of various events that can occur in an experiment.    Typically, the largest contribution to a scattering amplitude is the so-called \"tree-level approximation\", but substantial contributions can also come from \"higher-loop corrections\".  The calculation of both tree-level and higher-loop corrections, which is traditionally done using a tool called a \"Feynman diagram\", can be extremely complicated, if not prohibitively difficult, but over the last couple of decades, alternative more efficient approaches have been developed.\n\nA number of findings have resulted from this grant: (a) the discovery of constraints among higher-loop corrections to various scattering amplitudes that result from group theory alone,   (b) a more detailed understanding of infrared divergences afflicting gauge and gravity theories, and (c) an alternative approach to computing tree-level scattering amplitudes for massive particles in terms of solutions of scattering equations.\n\nWhile group-theory constraints have long been known for tree-level and one-loop amplitudes, the discovery of constraints for two- and higher-loop corrections is novel and potentially of use to reduce the number of calculations necessary to compute amplitudes.  Three papers that have resulted from this grant have elucidated the higher-loop group-theory constraints for scattering amplitudes involving four, five, and six external particles.\n\nWhen computing higher-loop contributions to gauge theory and gravity scattering amplitudes, one often encounters a difficulty known as an infrared divergence, due to the fact that the theory predicts the creation of an infinite number of very low energy gluons or gravitons in a scattering process.  There are known methods for taking into account and removing these divergences.   Much progress has been made on the structure of infrared divergences over the last decade.  Several papers that resulted from this grant elucidated the structure of certain kinds of infrared divergences in gauge theories as well as in theories of gravity.\n\nA very recent result by Cachazo, He, and Yuan is the discovery of a completely novel approach to computing tree-level scattering amplitudes.  Dispensing altogether with Feynman diagrams, this approach presents expressions for the scattering amplitude in terms of matrix expressions evaluated at solutions of a set of equations known as the scattering equations.  Their approach was applied only to scattering amplitudes of massless particles. The most recent paper resulting from this grant extended their result to amplitudes involving massive scalar particles, showing that this approach is useful beyond its initial application.\n\nAll of the findings of this project have been communicated to the larger particle theory community in the form of papers published in refereed journals and seminars delivered at other universities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/18/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen G Naculich"
