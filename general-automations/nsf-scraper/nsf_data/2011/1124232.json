 "awd_abstract_narration": "The legal right to a name and a registered birth is a central principle of modern human rights law. Birth registration is often identified as a \"gateway right.\" It is a necessary precursor for accessing political, economic, and social rights, including access to health care and education as well as protection from child labor, trafficking, and under-age marriage. However, the majority of children born in the developing world are never legally registered. The current project explores the factors that contribute to the low rates of birth registration as well as the cultural, social, and historical significance attributed to registering births in such locations. The research involves household surveys, semi-structured interviews, participant observation of birth registration activities, and archival research in Tanzania and England.\r\n\r\nPublic health and human rights campaigners have proposed that improving birth registration rates is one key means to improving health and development outcomes across the developing world. The results of the current research could offer insights into the continued presence of low birth registration rates in many developing countries.",

Birth registration is a basic human right, established by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1966, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990. However, nearly half of children born in the developing world are not registered. Why is birth registration an important issue? A birth certificate provides legal proof of age and identity, and may assist in accessing health and education services, claiming inheritance rights, or seeking protection from human rights abuses such as child labor and child marriage. A birth certificate is required to seek many other forms of identification, such as a passport, national identity card, voter registration card, or driver's license. Birth registration is also an important source of data which can be used to plan and improve health, education, and social services.

The purpose of this extensive archival research was to document the history of the practice of birth registration, how it was used in Tanzania to govern local people during the period of British colonial rule, and how it related to the provision of health and education services for children during the colonial era.
