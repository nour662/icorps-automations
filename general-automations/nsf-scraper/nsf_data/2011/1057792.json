 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Anthony Chianese of Colgate University, for the development of novel C-C-C based pincer type catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The goal of this work is to construct structure-reactivity relationships for a variety of catalysts whose electronic properties have been fine tuned with appropriate ligand substitutions. The functionalization of alkanes to alpha-olefins is a reaction of exceptional value and impacts the fine chemicals and polymer synthesis fields.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the research include the possibility of developing new alpha-olefins for novel polymer syntheses, and the potential for novel detergents and surfactants. For example, if an efficient catalyst is found with high selectivity that can use propylene as acceptor and yields terminal olefins, this could provide a major new route to these important building blocks. This research is ideal for an undergraduate institution, with students poised to learn organic and organometallic synthesis as well as a host of spectroscopic characterization methods. Professor Chianese is actively involved in outreach through the Colgate Summer Sport and Science Camp.",
