 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Great Tohoku Tsunami of 11 March 2011 has generated massive quantities of data that will be invaluable in helping to validate tsunami models such as the GeoClaw software being developed by the PI and his collaborators. This RAPID project will provide short-term support for two postdoctoral fellows and two graduate students to assist in collecting data and performing simulations. The main goals are to further validate the software and constituent numerical algorithms as tools for tsunami modeling, and to compare a variety of proposed earthquake source mechanisms for this event that have been developed by different groups of seismologists. Data sources will include NOAA DART buoys, tide gauges, videos and photographs, and post-tsunami surveys, both in the near field and far field. The postdoctoral fellows are experts in tsunami science who have experience in working with a variety of tsunami data, also have experience working with the GeoClaw software in their thesis work. The software implements high-resolution finite volume methods for the nonlinear shallow water equations, with provisions to robustly model inundation. Adaptive mesh refinement is incorporated to allow the efficient solution of the problem over the vast range of spatial scales required.\r\n\r\nTsunamis pose a severe threat to many coastal regions of the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. The offshore Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) running from Northern California up to British Columbia periodically produces a magnitude 9 earthquake, generating a tsunami of magnitude similar to that seen in the Indian Ocean in 2004 or from the Japanese tsunami of 2011 (The last major CSZ tsunami was in 1700). The entire West Coast, Hawaii, and Alaska are also at risk from tsunamis arising from many other potential sources.  Hazard mitigation and early warning systems require accurate computer simulation tools based on mathematical models of the generation and propagation of tsunamis and the subsequent flooding and inundation along the coast. It is important to test these models against real events, and the 11 March 2011 Great Tohoku Tsunami provides a wealth of data from a variety of sources. Performing a careful series of computational experiments will assist in validating the computational model developed at the University of Washington and will guide the development of further improvements to the model.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe GeoClaw software has previously been developed by the PI and\ncollaborators  to compute approximate solutions to the fluid dynamics\nequations that model the propagation of a tsunami across the ocean\nand the inundation of coastal regions.  Tsunami models are an\nimportant tool in understanding past earthquakes and tsunamis and\nfor hazard assessment and real-time warning.  Validation of tsunami\nmodels is necessary to assess how accurate they are, and comparison\nof model results with observations from past events is an important\naspect of validation.  The primary goal of this project was to use\nthe wealth of data generated by the 11 March 2011 Tohoku Tsunami\noff the coast of Japan to help validate the GeoClaw code for more\ngeneral use in tsunami modeling.\n\nTwo detailed studies have been performed.  The first involved\ncomparing observations of the tsunami at four locations in the Pacific\nOcean with simulations, and comparing the computed and observed\ninundation on the Sendai Plain and at four other locations along\nthe Sanriku coast of Japanese, north of Sendai.  In addition to\ncomparing observations with simulations, this study involved also\ncomparing 10 different tsunami \"sources\" that have been proposed\nfor this event by different research groups using different inversion\nmodels.  Each \"source\" is an estimate of how the seafloor moved\nduring the earthquake.  Since the seafloor motion cannot be measured\ndirectly, tsunami simulation is an important tool in studying the\nmechanics of the earthquake.\n\nThe second study compared the current velocity measured at gauges\nnear Hawaii with velocities computed as part of the GeoClaw\nsimulations.  Most past comparisons of tsunami models with observed\ndata have concerned the height of the wave and/or the depth and\nextent of inundation. Until recently, few direct measurements of\ntsunami velocities existed to compare with model results. During\nthe 11 March 2011 Tohoku Tsunami, 328 velocity gauges were in place\naround the Hawaiian Islands that captured time series of water\nvelocity in 18 locations, in both harbors and deep channels, at\nvarious depths. This provided a rich set of data to perform comparisons\nof the velocities produced by the GeoClaw model with observations\nof this data.  Using one of the tsunami sources that was found to\nmatch observations well in the first study, the second study compared\nthe GeoClaw results with the observations at 10 of the gauge locations\naround Hawaii.
