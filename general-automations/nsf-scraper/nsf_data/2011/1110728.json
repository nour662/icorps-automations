 "awd_abstract_narration": "Of the estimated 1.5 million fungal species on earth, only about 74,000 species have been formally described.  Current knowledge of the biology of most of the described fungal species is poor. Estimates of global fungal diversity often hinge on the number of unique fungal species thought to be associated with individual plant species. However, if fungi that live in association with plants are sensitive to genetic differences among individuals within plant species, then there may be much more hidden fungal diversity. It is therefore important to increase survey efforts, and to examine the potential for fungal communities to differ among genetically different individual plants. This study focuses on variation in fungal communities among genetically different individuals within narrowleaf cottonwoods using an experimental forest in which multiple clones of an individual are planted in the same environment. This project will add to previous findings in two major ways.  First, it compares the diversity estimates of fungi using culturing techniques with diversity estimates based on direct examination of fungal DNA.  Second, the study will estimate the amount of fungal tissue in individual plants by measuring the fungal steroid, ergosterol.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: There are several ways in which a broader impact will be ensured for this research. First, it will be presented at the Flagstaff Festival of Science (FFS) 2011. The FFS is a 10-day event that promotes science to people of all ages. Participants will view endophytic fungal cultures using microscopy and handle locally collected sporocarps from a variety of fungi. Second, findings from this research will be disseminated to regional groups through the cottonwood ecology group's Research Notes for Land Managers periodical. This publication is distributed to nearly 20 groups, including government agencies, non-profit land conservation groups, and environmental education centers. Third, this research will also facilitate the training of undergraduate lab volunteers in culturing and molecular methods. Fourth, results will be presented to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, and published in peer-reviewed journals.\r\n",
