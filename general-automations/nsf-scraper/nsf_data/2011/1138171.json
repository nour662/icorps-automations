This workshop will bring together scientists and students from the nation's geological SIMS laboratories, instrument manufacturers, and other interested parties to discuss the state of the art of SIMS microbeam analysis techniques and scientific results.  The BGSW is of great importance to the national geochemistry community since it represents the only regular meeting of researchers from geochemically-oriented SIMS labs in the United States. These facilities are vital for developing new geochemical SIMS applications and for providing access and expertise to scientists from across the country who require SIMS capabilities to carry out their own research.",
