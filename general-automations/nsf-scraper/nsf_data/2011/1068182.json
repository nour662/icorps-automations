 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is enabling students to experience the excitement and reward from choosing a major in engineering or computer science by engaging them early in the engineering curriculum and cultivating their continued interest in engineering and their self-esteem.  To accomplish this, the investigators are (1) involving faculty members and peers in the mentoring of every first and second student in the school of engineering; (2) involving engineering underclassmen in research and practical internships with the University and with local, regional and national agencies and corporations; (3) developing a structured approach to reward students who are progressing toward their degrees, and (4) enabling underclassmen to attend professional development conferences, such as the ASEE meetings.  Evaluation efforts, under the direction of a social science faculty member, are using demographic and enrollment data, student surveys, and observational data to monitor progress and adjust program activities. Postings on a project website, presentations at national meetings, and annual workshops are being used to dissemination the project's approaches and results.",
