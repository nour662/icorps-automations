 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computers were invented to automate tedious and error-prone\r\ntasks, especially in the context of numerical calculations for\r\nscientific simulation. Given the importance and difficulty of \r\ndeveloping these simulations, it makes sense to study whether \r\ncomputers can assist in their production as well.  This project \r\nfocuses on the open-source project Sundance, which provides\r\nhigh-level syntax to describe finite element methods (FEM) for the\r\nnumerical solution of partial differential equations, freeing users \r\nfrom the burdens of low-level programming. This approach can reduce \r\ndevelopment time from months to days or even hours, allowing \r\nscientists and engineers to get correct answers more quickly. \r\nSundance is useful software starting from a solid theoretical basis,\r\nwhere the structure of finite element operators are derived and\r\nanalyzed from software-based Frechet differentiation of variational\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nVia this domain-specific embedded language, Sundance users (domain\r\nscientistis and engineers) can express and simulate nonlinear processes \r\nwith little more difficulty than linear ones; Jacobians are calculated \r\ninternally and automatically.  This robust system automates not only \r\nstandard simulations, but also sensitivity calculations, eigenvalue\r\nproblems, and PDE-constrained optimization, all through the language of\r\ndifferentiation, providing a simple gateway to efficient ``embedded''\r\nalgorithms for optimization and control.  Furthermore, in this project, \r\nSundance will be extended to run on emerging architectures such as \r\nmulticore CPU and GPU machines.  New low-complexity finite element \r\nalgorithms based on Bernstein polynomials will be developed and included \r\nwithin Sundance to further exploit this new hardware.  Thus, this project \r\nrepresents concrete transformational contributions not only automating\r\nmathematical software but in core numerical algorithms, broadening the\r\ncircle of domain specialists with access to leading-edge simulation\r\ntechnology.",
