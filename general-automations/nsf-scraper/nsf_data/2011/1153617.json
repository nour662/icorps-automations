 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contemporary information technology is ever more central to science and society  in the midst of the deluge of complex data. The impact on bioscience is notable, where the pace of production and the data complexity means that a large amount of data is often not adequately analyzed by the data producers, yet researchers expect rapid dissemination of such types of data. To ensure effective impact, a solution promising to be transformational is to open \"big data\" analysis to the broader community. An avenue is provided by modern IT and the explosive growth and democratizing impact of the Internet, which, following the digitization of information and communication, has changed the pace of information exchange and opens up new channels for disseminating data and for engaging disparate disciplines in extended, productive collaborations.  The result of this will be a platform with a customized pre-build interface that will significantly reduce the downside of the form-based data input approach. The input interface  will be  small, easy to use and readily accepted by users but still relevant to what a user might want to input. The interface will provide strong search ability to the controlled vocabulary and provide users with this information through \"input hint\", dropdown lists or auto-completion, according to what is most efficient for the specific extension and provides an effective, readily followed and precise process. Sustaining the free text input section will provide users with maximum freedom of data input. By enabling community collaboration via Web access and implementing a database resource linked with the knowledge collection interface together with free text entry format, this system will provide a venue for researchers among many communities, including those located at non-research intensive universities, community colleges and minority-serving institutions, in this Nation and worldwide, to contribute their insight to experimental research observations that currently requires expensive specialized equipment only available in a few centers around the world.",

TOPSAN is a resource that combines features of a wiki &ndash; allowing its users free input and editing of the pages and features of a database interface &ndash; providing information about object being written about extracted from an internal database. The goal of this EAGER was to expand TOPSAN from on internal tool used by a specific project (JCSG) for internal communications to a general tool that could help a broad community of users to annotate interesting protein structures and foster ad-hoc collaborations leading to preparation of peer-reviewed papers. TOPSAN is open for viewing to all, including unregistered users and is getting significant traffic from Google and other general search engines. This project sponsored two scientific meetings (DUF Jamboree in 2012 and 2013), which involved a group of over 60 researchers from several countries and two continents, about &frac12; of which were undergraduate/graduate students or postdocs. The meeting and intensive collaborations it fostered lead to publication of 9 peer reviewed manuscripts. Interestingly, only two manuscripts were finalized at the meeting and others were written via remote interactions supported by the TOPSAN platform. Despite their recent release, these publications already garnered significant recognition (9 citations and over 500 downloads, data from Google Scholar and plumX). So, work in this project have shown that TOPSAN can support large interactive collaborations between dispersed groups of scientists in successful, large scale collaboration. At the same time, the number and quality of generally available TOPSAN pages were improved, increasing the wiki-like content available to and accessed by the general public or at least its members interested in protein structures and functions.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/19/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mark&nbsp;H&nbsp;Ellisman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
