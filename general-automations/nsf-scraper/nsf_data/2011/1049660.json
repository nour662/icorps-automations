 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nThis project is to model the developments of faults during the bending of the tectonic plate as it approaches a subduction zone.  Two dimensional and three dimensional numerical models will be developed using a finite element code.  The results of the modeling will be compared to observations of fault patterns observed at subduction zones, mainly the Central America trench where there are plentiful data.  Understanding plate strength and how the plate behaves is crucial in geodynamics as convection and energy dissipation on the Earth are mainly driven and caused by subducting oceanic plates.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis project is to support a postdoctoral researcher and the results will be shared with the MARGINS community and the broader geologic community",
