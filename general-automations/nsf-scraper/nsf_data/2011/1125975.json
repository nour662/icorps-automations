The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) vapochromic sensor materials, (b) organic materials for use in bulk heterojunction solar cells, and (c) dechlorination of environmental pollutants.\r\n\r\nAn X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research at a consortium of institutions that include the College of St. Catherine, Carleton College, University of Minnesota at Morris and the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University.",
