 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will move OndaVia?s water contaminant detection technology from proof-of-concept to commercial prototype. As experts in microfluidic design, OndaVia uses its innovations to manufacture devices that provide near real-time, precise water analysis in the field. Our Phase I SBIR project goal was to prove the feasibility of detecting 100 part-per-billion-level water contamination using an embedded surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) region within a microfluidic channel?a goal achieved with excellent results. The objective of this Phase II effort is to build a prototype water analysis system, the anticipated results of which will set the stage for rapid incorporation of this proprietary detection technology into OndaVia?s line of analytical instruments.\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are emphasized by the belief that the world is running out of ?quality? water. Reservoirs are depleting, ground water is frequently contaminated through petroleum extraction, and new industrial contaminants are found in lakes and rivers every day. Typical analysis requires collecting a sample in the field and shipping the sample to a test\r\nlaboratory; water monitoring agencies depend upon these outsourced laboratories where transport and processing time can take days to produce results, wasting precious time when the health of a community is at stake. Field-ready, real-time measurement tools that detect a wide array of compounds at a parts-per-billion or better level would be a powerful, valuable, and necessary addition to the water testing toolbox.",
