 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California, Riverside is awarded a grant to develop\r\nan innovative sequencing protocol for hierarchical (i.e., BAC-by-BAC)\r\ngenome sequencing of large eukaryotic genomes. At the core of the\r\nprotocol is the ability to solve a set of hard computational\r\nquestions, which are the focus of the research plan. The computational\r\nchallenges require the study of novel combinatorial optimization\r\nproblems, the development of innovative time- and space-efficient\r\nalgorithms, and ultimately the implementation and deployment of\r\nuser-friendly web-based software tools.  The new combinatorial\r\nsequencing protocol is going to be tested to the cowpea genome. Cowpea\r\nVigna unguiculata, also known as China bean or black-eyed pea,\r\nis one of the most important food legume crops in the semi-arid\r\ntropics covering Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. A\r\ndrought-tolerant and warm-weather crop, cowpeas are well-adapted to\r\nthe drier regions of the tropics, where other food legumes do not\r\nperform well.  Its modest genome size makes it an excellent candidate\r\nto demonstrate the utility of our protocol. We expect the final\r\nassembly to provide a sufficient depth of knowledge to support most\r\ndownstream applications including map-based cloning of trait\r\ndeterminants, development of markers for marker-assisted breeding,\r\nmicroarray development for gene expression studies and analysis of\r\nsynteny with related species.\r\n\r\nThis project will advance sequencing techniques for complex genomes,\r\nusing cowpea, an essential food source in developing\r\ncountries. Software tools and the assembled data will be placed into\r\nthe public domain, which will benefit researchers and the public\r\nworldwide, and potentially lead to new international and industrial\r\ncollaborations. This project will directly support one graduate\r\nstudents in a highly interdisciplinary environment, building on UCR's\r\nstrengths in Computer Science and Agricultural\r\nSciences. Undergraduates will have opportunities to participate in\r\nresearch through a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site\r\nat UCR, a collaboration with a nearby community college, and a new US\r\nDepartment of Education Title V Hispanic Serving Institution grant\r\n(UCR is an accredited HSI).\r\n\r\nMore details and information about this project will be available at\r\nhttp://www.cs.ucr.edu/~stelo/dbi.htm",
