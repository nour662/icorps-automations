Forum (Forum) for the National Science Foundation/ Tribal Colleges and Universities\r\nProgram (TCUP) awardees and for the presidents at each of the nation?s 33 accredited Tribal\r\nColleges and Universities (TCUs). The Forum will focus on strategies and best practices for\r\nsuccessfully recruiting and retaining American Indian students in science, technology, engineering\r\nand mathematics (STEM).\r\nDuring the 2-day TCU STEM Leaders? Forum participants (including TCUP principal investigators\r\nand project directors, TCU presidents, and NSF representatives) will discuss issues and participate\r\nin formal sessions during which they will share and explore best practices and innovative\r\napproaches to strengthening the American Indian STEM pipeline. The Forum will provide a opportunity\r\nfor tribal colleges to engage in and contribute to the national discussion on broadening participation\r\nin STEM.\r\nA key outcome of the proposed Forum will be increased success in recruiting and retaining\r\nIndian student in STEM programs at TCUs, as effective practices are identified and implemented.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed Forum will promote a community of practice among NSF TCUP managers and faculty,\r\nfacilitating the exchange of best practices and strategies for achieving the common goal of\r\nimproving STEM participation and achievement among American Indian students. The proposed\r\nForum will engage national STEM leaders, including the leadership at NSF and tribal colleges,\r\nin a critical dialogue focusing on the current state of knowledge and understanding of broadening\r\nparticipation strategies as they are applied by tribal colleges.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe Forum will make an important contribution to the ongoing debate on how best to promote\r\nbroader participation of the nation?s underserved and underrepresented minorities in STEM\r\neducation and professions. It will promote the exploration and greater understanding of state-of-the-art\r\nbroadening participation strategies not only by tribal college faculty and administrators,\r\nbut by the leadership at NSF and other federal agencies with science missions.",
