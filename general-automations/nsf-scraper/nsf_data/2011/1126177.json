 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Mihaela Iovu from University of Texas Dallas and colleagues A. Dean Sherry, John Ferraris, Dennis Smith and Jung-Mo Ahn will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with two probes. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) polythiophene-CdSe blends for bulk heterojunction solar cells, (b) perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) polymers for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and gas separation applications, (c) fluorovinylene aryl ether telechelic polymers for thermal chain extension and tandem crosslinking, (d) lanthanide complexes and polymers as metabolic sensors for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and (e) development of peptidomimetics for treatment of diabetes mellitus.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
