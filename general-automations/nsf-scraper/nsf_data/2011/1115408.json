 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many areas of science and engineering differential equations are employed as\r\nmodels of complex phenomena. The focus in this proposal is on the approximation\r\nof solutions of infinite dimensional dynamical systems. In particular, the investigator\r\nand his colleagues are interested in understanding the dynamics of the finite dimensional \r\napproximations and how they relate to the dynamics of the original dynamical system. \r\nThe specific issues to be investigated are related to stability of solutions of spatially \r\ndiscrete reaction-diffusion equations, the dynamics of so-called anti-diffusion lattice \r\ndifferential equations, dynamics and computation of traveling waves for neutral mixed \r\ntype functional differential equations and rigorous computation of periodic orbits \r\nfor retarded delay equations, robust stability for time dependent linear Hamiltonian systems, \r\nnumerical techniques for efficient computation of Lyapunov exponent like quantities based \r\nupon nonlinear flows, and approximation techniques for stability spectra of delay equations \r\nand partial differential equations. Techniques to investigate these systems combine \r\nnumerical analysis and dynamical systems ideas to gain a better understanding of \r\napproximation dynamics. \r\n\r\nOften in complex systems the differential equations used in modeling are infinite \r\ndimensional, but necessarily these models are approximated by finite dimensional \r\nsystems in order to perform numerical simulations. In order to understand the behavior of \r\nthese models, the investigator and his colleagues are interested in similarities \r\nand differences in the behavior of the original infinite dimensional system and \r\nfinite dimensional approximations, for example those obtained through discretization. \r\nUnderstanding the impact of discretization leads to greater confidence when \r\nmaking inferences from simulation results. In addition, stability analysis is useful \r\nin understanding the robustness of complex biological phenomena that occur in the \r\nenvironment and in identifying instabilities, for example, in models of weather prediction. \r\nDiscrete models of both biological and physical processes are becoming more important as \r\nthe need for detailed, microscopic models increases and should benefit from improved \r\nanalysis and computational capabilities.",
