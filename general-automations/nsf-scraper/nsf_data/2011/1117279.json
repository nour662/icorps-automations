 "awd_abstract_narration": "The world's population is growing older; it is estimated that in 2050 there will be three times more people over the age 85 than there are today. Many are expected to need physical and cognitive assistance, and all will need additional healthcare. Shortages in primary care physicians, nurses, and managed care facility space and staff are already an issue today, creating a niche for assistive technologies to fill the care gap. A growing body of research shows that certain behavior patterns have a positive impact on longevity and wellness, including regular physical exercise, social interaction, and cognitive engagement. This project aims to develop and evaluate socially assistive human-machine interaction techniques that influence the user to engage in and comply with wellness-promoting behaviors in the home or nursing home in order to enhance longevity and quality of life.\r\nThis work is focused on developing socially assistive systems (SAS) using peer-level human-machine interaction in which the machine serves in the role of a knowledgeable embodied agent capable of providing time-extended, sustained, and engaging interaction. The research focuses on two types of wellness-promoting human-machine interactions: 1) exercise sessions (cognitive and/or physical) and 2) socializing sessions.  For one-on-one exercise sessions, the project is developing SAS capabilities that provide exercise monitoring, coaching, and motivation.  For socialization, the research is developing SAS capabilities that provide social interaction and friendly reminders and encouragement to comply with health regimens (taking medicine, being physically active) and healthy habits (calling family, meeting friends).  The two types of interactions share the common goal of influencing human behavior, and the main contribution of the research is the set of methods and algorithms for influencing behavior though human-machine interaction. This is achieved through a novel two-fold approach: 1) adaptive interaction steering for short-term interactions, and 2) motivation and coaching of behavior in longer-term interactions to maintain engagement and enhance task performance. The embodiment of the SAS is leveraged to maximize engagement and compliance; a key focus of the work is on developing a comprehensive method for natural, persuasive and engaging embodied communication. The methods and algorithms being developed are general, and will be implemented and tested on both computer-based and robot-based agents.  In this way the work validates the developed methods on multiple technology platforms and embodiments, and compares their relative effectiveness and acceptability by the intended user population. The specifics of the implementation are informed by an early focus group with elderly participants, the target user population.  The developed techniques are being implemented in both human-computer interaction (HCI) and human-robot interaction (HRI) versions, and are being evaluated with a large group of elderly users interacting with the SAS implementations over a multi-week user study.  The work is focused on generating methods, algorithms, and a large corpus of multi-modal data (video, audio, and questionnaires) for grounding continued research into health and wellness-relevant HRI and HCI.\r\n        This project aims to address a component of the nationally recognized healthcare challenge of promoting wellness and longevity in the aging population.   Beyond basic algorithm and method development, the project implements and tests real-world socially assistive systems, both computer-based and robot-based, with a large population of elderly retirement home residents.  The project is expected to produce insights useful for both research and healthcare product development for addressing this growing segment of the population.  In addition to the socially relevant research focus, the project team is also engaged in a comprehensive program of K-12 outreach activities, which use robotics to promote STEM topic learning using the health theme of the proposal.  The project involves inner city K-12 teachers and students in annual open houses, assemblies, and workshops that provide hands-on experiences with assistive systems for the elderly, as well as take-home materials for continued learning.  The project team includes PhD students, undergraduates, and K-12 volunteers, and establishes a mentoring pipeline so that university students are both mentored and serve as mentors and role models for their younger peers.",

This project developed and validated socially assistive techniques for influencing behavior toward prescribed wellness goals by steering interaction dynamics and by encouraging performance.

In particular, the project developed a novel approach to user-guided interactions, namely interactions that are initiated and guided by the user toward accomplishing some user-specified task. In those types of interactions, the goal of the service robot is to successfully carry out the user-defined task. In designing an HRI methodology to address these and other possible user-defined service tasks for wellness, it is important to consider the following characteristics of the user-guided interactions: 1) users are non-experts; 2) tasks may be specific to the user&rsquo;s environment/preferences and are unknown in advance (i.e., the system cannot program all solutions a priori); and 3) users may need to teach the robot how to perform the tasks. Along with these characteristics, a guiding principle for the methodology is that the method of interaction/teaching should be natural and practical for non-expert users. This work contributes a novel methodology that allows socially assistive systems to interpret and follow spatial language instructions, with and without user-specified natural language constraints and/or unvoiced pragmatic constraints.</p>\n<p>In the context of stroke rehabilitation, this project showed that people have improved performance at the task over time when guided by the SAR coach and found that people respond better to feedback that compares their performance to their own past performance, then when compared to the performance of others (better of worse). In the context of exercise for overweight adolescents, this project found that adolescents were comfortable exercising with the robot, liked that the robot performed exercises along with them, and encouraged them, and were positive about the robot having a backstory.&nbsp; This project included the largest study to date comparing human-robot vs. human-computer interaction in both elderly and young adult participants, in the context of coaching seated exercises (&ldquo;chair aerobics&rdquo;) and found that people strongly (81% to 19%) preferred interacting with a physical robot compared to a screen, and exercised longer with the robot than with the screen.&nbsp; This study is the first to comprehensively show this result with the elderly population.
