 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Wecoma, a 185? general purpose research vessel operated by Oregon State University as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  The vessel is owned by the National Science Foundation. The request includes:\r\n\r\n1) GPS Based Network Time Server\r\n2) Multicorer Refurbishment\r\n3) Acoustic Testing on R/V WECOMA\r\n4) Double-Rate Pingers\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\tThe principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researcher.",
