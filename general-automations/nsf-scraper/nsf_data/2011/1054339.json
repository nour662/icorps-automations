 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the number of cores increases on the same die, computer architects and system designers have focused their attention to the on-chip network that is used for communication between the cores. Two of the major problems facing on-chip architectures are excessive power dissipation and reduced network performance. One approach to extend the performance of future multi-cores is to integrate new technologies, such as nano-photonics into the electronic design flow. Nano-photonics offers a scalable, low power per bit and a high- performance technology solution to current electrical signaling and interconnect bottlenecks. This research seeks to exploit this emerging field of nano-photonics and design reconfigurable, energy-efficient and high- performance on-chip architectures and switching interconnects. The goal of this research is to develop interconnects that can dynamically tune to the application and regulate power and bandwidth without system intervention. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will have a significant impact on the design of future multi-cores using nano-photonics. The proposed research will make advances in the understanding of the interplay between performance, energy, hardware complexity and reconfigurability. This research will also play a major role in education by integrating research with teaching and training. The educational goal of this multi-disciplinary and multi-faceted proposed research is to expose undergraduate and graduate students to diverse technological advancements with an emphasis on critical analysis and reasoning to overcome limitations of current technologies. Finally, the results and findings of the proposed research will be disseminated to researchers, engineers and educators through technical publications and presentations.",

Photonic interconnects can provide high interconnect bandwidth by combining multiple wavelengths, provide minimal access latencies, and high power-efficiency that remains independent of capacity and distance for on-chip communications. In this project, we have explored several aspects of utilizing photonics for NoCs. In R-3PO, we designed a 3D stacked photonic architecture where multiple layers enabled higher bandwidth density, simplified layout design, and reduced network power [1]. Unlike a global crossbar, we developed a decomposed crossbar architecture on multiple photonic layers with optical vias to prevent waveguide crossings and reduce power consumption. As multicores run diverse scientific and commercial applications, networks that can adapt to communication traffic will yield substantial performance gains while optimizing the resources such as wavelengths and waveguides. In R-3PO, we implement a reconfiguration algorithm that uses hardware counters to track link and buffer utilization to decide which links to reconfigure and adapt network bandwidths based on application demands. In PROBE, we tackle the static power consumption of external laser by predicting channel utilization and scaling the number of wavelengths and waveguides [2]. In PULSE, we extend the performance and reduce power consumed in shared-memory multicores that use snoopy-based cache coherence protocols by multicasting transactions to select cores that cache the block instead of broadcasting to all nodes [3]. In CLAPNET, we propose clockwise and counter-clockwise communication to reduce the laser power loss due to requests and responses traveling different path lengths [4]. The CLAP-NET design leverages shared waveguides to enable dynamic bandwidth allocation for improved network throughput, and a decomposed crossbar with reduced optical insertion losses and power consumption. In Laser Pooling, we propose sharing available laser power between all links of the network, such that laser power may be released from idle links and claimed by another link both statically and dynamically [5]. We refer to this as <em>pooling </em>laser power between the links of the network to maximize energy savings with marginal performance impact. To reduce the static power, in PEARL, we propose a dynamic laser scaling technique that predicts the power level for the next epoch using the buffer occupancy of previous epoch using machine learning techniques [6]. In terms of broader impact, this project has provided training to graduate and undergraduate students in modeling and simulation of NoC architectures and has resulted in 5 MS theses and 2 PhD dissertations.
