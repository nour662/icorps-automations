 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the instruction and supervision of Dr. Daniel Pullen, Debra Trusty will study changes in prehistoric ceramic cooking vessels from five important sites in Greece: the Petsas House at Mycenae, the Potter's Shop at Zygouries, the East Alley at Korakou, and the newly-discovered sites of Stiri and Kalamianos. Mycenae, located in the northeast Peloponnese of Greece, was such an influential citadel and developed such remarkable innovations that it gave its name to the culture of the prehistoric Greek mainland during the Late Bronze Age, known as the Mycenaean period (1,600-1,200 BC). The other four sites incorporated into this study have varying connections to Mycenae which changed over time depending upon their access to raw materials and trade routes. This study focuses on identifying how Mycenae gained political control in the northeast Peloponnese, especially in areas previously thought to be outside of Mycenae's influence. Ms. Trusty will conduct specific archaeological techniques, including petrographic microscopy and Neutron Activation analysis, on ceramic cooking vessels to determine if and how Mycenae was able to manufacture and trade such items to peripheral sites by Mycenae for economic and social gain.\r\n\r\nThis research is significant because it provides insight into the dynamics which allow traditional societies to function and to expand over time. Because archaeology can document \"slow\" changes which often take place on a millennial time scale it provides a unique window into the processes which lead to societal transformation. This research provides a case in point.\r\n\r\nCooking pots are important elements of daily life in all cultures as they bridge the gap between elite and lower classes through the common need for nourishment and are frequently found in large numbers in archaeological excavations. Such vessels can be tested using different ceramic analyses that can identify the sources of raw materials, uses of vessels, and production methods distinctive of individual potters or workshops. Nevertheless, cooking pots are an understudied and misunderstood element of Mycenaean culture. Ms. Trusty seeks to correct this imbalance by analyzing changes in stylistic features of cookware vessels, examining production techniques, determining the origin of minerals within clays through use of a petrographic microscope, and studying distribution patterns through Neutron Activation Analysis conducted on clay types. By accomplishing this four-step methodology it is argued that a \"changing of the guard\" can be identified at peripheral sites, where the area initially had strong trading contact with various cities in Greece until Mycenae achieved dominance over long-distance trade by the beginning of the Mycenaean period. These results will aid in identifying specific measures taken by the elite in Mycenae in order to gain and maintain control over territories and trade routes.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to have a broader impact as it is strongly dependent upon international collaboration and contributes to projects directed by scholars in the United States. Research will be conducted in Greece using laboratories and equipment from the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, the British School in Athens, and the National Center for Scientific Research in Athens. The conclusions reached for this project will result in a published dissertation and smaller articles and presentations, which will be submitted to international and national journals and conferences. Such endeavors aim to contribute to the general understanding of science, archaeology, ancient economies, and ceramic studies.",
