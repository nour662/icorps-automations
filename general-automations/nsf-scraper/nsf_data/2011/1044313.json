The project provides a unique approach by integrating emerging technologies of hardware security into engineering curricula to stimulate innovation, project-based creative thinking, and life-long learning for these future engineers. The project employs a paradigm shift from teaching computer systems security countermeasures to learning \"hacker\" methodologies through hands-on experiences. The outcomes are compared with traditional curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe proposed curriculum improvements are achieved by: (1) developing courseware and teaching modules requiring intense study of computer systems hardware security and the trust assumptions provided by the hardware; (2) understanding countermeasures and techniques to address non-traditional attack scenarios; (3) developing a culture of aggressive \"hacking\" while still emphasizing professionalism and ethics; (4) developing a senior design capstone track that continues building on hardware security principles and exposes students to creative entrepreneurial thinking; and (5) developing modules that are adaptable for non-engineering students in 2-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThe teaching modules in the \"hacker curriculum\" framework are adaptable and are accessible even without an engineering background. The outcomes and lessons learned in this experiment are disseminated in journals, conferences and on a dedicated website.",
