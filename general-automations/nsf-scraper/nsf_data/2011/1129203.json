 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project an interdisciplinary research team from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Stanford University, and Rutgers University will study the transcriptomes of Gambierdiscus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus in Hawaiian coastal waters - toxin-producing species that pose significant health hazards to humans. Their goal is to elucidate the mechanisms associated with toxin production by Gambierdiscus and inactivation by sunlight of the bacterial pathogen, S. aureus, and the fecal indicator, Enterococcus. Because the transcriptome of an organism reflects the genes that are actively being expressed at any given time, this study, by elucidating levels of messenger RNA expression in the target organisms, should provide valuable insights into the mechanisms responsible for toxin production, responses to stress and/or subsequent bacterial inactivation. \r\n\r\nThe research program will be organized around four working hypotheses: \r\nH1: Production of ciguatoxin by Gambierdiscus reflects the physiological condition of the culture as influenced by temperature, irradiance, and growth phase. \r\nH2: High throughput transcriptome analysis from toxin (+) and toxin (-) cultures will allow the identification of genes involved in ciguatoxin production and understanding of the light and nutrient conditions that favor this function. \r\nH3: Whereas E. faecalis is susceptible to indirect photoinactivation under exposure to sunlight in seawater, S. aureus is not. This is likely due to the presence of carotenoid pigments within the cells, which are able to quench reactive oxygen species. \r\nH4: E. faecalis and S. aureus respond to photo-stress in clear seawater by up-regulating genes that encode for proteins to repair cellular damage and mitigate oxidative stress; this \"stressome\" will change with increasing exposure to photostress, revealing the stress at which repair is no longer possible. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The information that will be gathered in this study is expected to contribute significantly to advancing the field of risk management with respect to recreational water use and seafood consumption beyond reliance on empirical correlations and towards policies that are based on a mechanistic understanding of the threats these organisms pose to human health.",

Before we can combat HABs however, we must first understand the genome of dinoflagellates and how it explains their biology and ecology. This goal is particularly challenging because dinoflagellates have some of the most massive (several fold greater than in humans) and complex nuclear genomes known to science.&nbsp; This project focused on the toxic dinoflagellate <em>Gambierdiscus</em> that is the causative agent of ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP). This is the most frequent form of non-bacterial food poisoning of humans worldwide. The presence and density of these dinoflagellates is thus of utmost importance to many involved in the fisheries, biology, tourism and human health. The project team was comprised of two groups. One was in Hawaii and led by Paul Bienfang, who was in charge of isolating and culturing these cells, which is highly challenging. They also studied the conditions that favor the rapid growth of <em>Gambierdiscus</em>. This work showed that this alga is able to live mixotrophically and can utilize a variety of sugars such as mannose and cellobiose, in addition to its photosynthetic ability. The team at Rutgers led by PI Bhattacharya received the cultures and used them to generate a rich genomic inventory from <em>Gambierdiscus caribaeus</em> using next generation sequencing and then reconstructed its metabolic pathways. Both of these approaches showed that <em>Gambierdiscus</em> possesses a vast collection of genes that allow it to scavenge nitrogen sources such as urea and carbon sources to augment its primary production. Surprisingly, this versatility is not <em>Gambierdiscus</em>-specific but shared by a broad array of dinoflagellates. These results demonstrate that dinoflagellates trace their origin to a mixotrophic ancestor and have retained many genes that allow them to thrive in a variety of challenging environments. Our work underlines just how challenging it will be to control these HAB-forming species given their arsenal of genetic tools for survival.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts:</strong> This grant partially or fully supported the publication of five scientific papers and the genome data that was produced will be made available at public repositories such as NCBI for the broadest scientific impact.
