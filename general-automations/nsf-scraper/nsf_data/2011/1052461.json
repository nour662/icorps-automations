 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multi-colored fluorescence of reef-building corals is one of the most striking visual phenomena in the ocean. A number of observations indicate that fluorescent proteins play a major role in the interaction of  corals with the environment, including responses to stress and symbiotic microalgae. However, the mechanism of action and the role of different colors remains obscure. Coral fluorescence thus represents a substantial gap in the basic knowledge of coral eco-physiology, directly relevant to understanding the factors contributing to the ongoing decline of coral reefs worldwide. This project will investigate morphological, physiological and molecular traits correlating with fluorescence, and will test specific hypotheses concerning functions of individual colors, in early life stages of the table coral Acropora hyacinthus, a major reef-builder of the Indo-Pacific. The expected results include advancement of the basic knowledge of coral biology, clarification of the molecular function of fluorescent proteins, and possible biomarker applications for reef management based on non-invasive optical methods. The results of the project will be published in open-access journals; all the data and materials will be made available promptly to the broad scientific community. The main subject of the project (why coral reefs are colorful) has considerable public appeal and represents a rich opportunity for outreach, which will include lectures and press releases to increase public awareness of global climate change, and presentations in schools to raise the interest of children from underrepresented groups to pursue science as an academic or professional goal.",
