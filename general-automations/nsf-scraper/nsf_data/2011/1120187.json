 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project addresses fundamental challenges in key aspects associated with scalable synthesis, patterning, and integration of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene. Novel high-throughput scalable nanomanufacturing (SNM) techniques are being pioneered with the capability of continuous processing of revolutionary carbon-based devices and hybrid systems, promising a transformative leap in the commercialization of carbon nanomaterials. The success of this work may jumpstart bulk production and practical large area applications based on graphene and CNTs. The project also implements a strong outreach and educational plan aimed at promoting science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education among underrepresented groups. The knowledge and experience gained in these fabrication technologies are being made available to the broader scientific community through conference presentations, journal publications, and the user network of the NSF-supported National Nanofabrication Infrastructure Network (NNIN), where the University of Michigan is one of the NNIN sites.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: The objective of this project is to invent and develop new high-throughput SNM technologies that will bring graphene- and CNT-based nanomaterials and their hybrids to practical large-area applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and mechanics. A multidisciplinary approach has been adopted to address fundamental roadblocks hindering continuous nanomanufacturing of carbon nanomaterials. A fundamental understanding of processing mechanisms enables the design of machines and processes that in turn provides high-throughput manufacturing of nanoscale structures, devices, and systems using carbon-based materials. The project includes building a laboratory-scale machine for continuous chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of CNTs and graphene on flexible substrates, and the integration of a suite of novel and scalable patterning and modification techniques suitable for large-area carbon nanomaterial films. Together, the SNM technology is being used to build and test CNT- and graphene-based hybrid photovoltaics, metamaterials, and high-surface-area filters. The project also implements a summer research opportunity program, and creates a mobile educational exhibit and associated activities that can help engage underrepresented student at conventions of the national societies such as the National Society of Black Engineers. Students are receiving cutting-edge training in nanotechnology, while gaining valuable experience in understanding what is necessary to commercialize nanomaterials and manufacturing processes via interactions with industrial partners.",

Carbon nanotubes can be produced in a variety of ways but each method has tradeoffs. One method called Chemical Vapor Deposition(CVD) uses tiny particles as a seed for the Carbon Nanotube to grow. When nanotubes grow from seed particles that are close together they push on each other and grow in the same direction forming a forest.

The forest can grow for a long time but then stops suddenly when the number of active seeds falls and nanotubes no longer push on each other. The disadvantage of CVD is that the recipe, including the temperature, gases, contamination, and the exact steps, must be exactly controlled or the forest will not grow efficiently. We grew nanotubes in a typical CVD process but also used a high energy laser pulse to modify the process, when a nanotube is exposed to the laser the bonds in the nanotube can break and the carbon is vaporized. When the laser pulse is added just as nanotubes begin to grow the nanotube forest is destroyed but then regrows for a longer period of time and 50 to 150 times taller. A common industrial method to create nanotubes is to vaporize a solid target made of carbon and metal with a laser pulse; the metal gas condenses into a seed particle that absorbs the carbon gas and grows a nanotube. The method used in this work combines both that laser vaporization method and the CVD method so that nanotubes can be produced in very large volumes but without sacrifices purity, length, and control of the nanotube diameter and thickness. Our method is a new way to manipulate the energy and atmosphere of the seed particle to combine the advantages of two methods, purity and control of CVD with the high volume of laser vaporization.
