 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will develop processes and methodologies to support effective integration of the NSF incoherent scatter radars (ISRs).  The ISRs provide observations of a broad range of ionospheric and thermospheric properties used in space science studies for more than four decades.  Recent community-based assessments of the global ISR network have recommended better coordination of scientific and technical activities being undertaken at the various sites.  The Integrated Facilities Office (InFO) will coordinate scientific and technical activities at the NSF facilities, taking advantage of the entire available skill sets across all facilities. InFO will be located at SRI International in Menlo Park, California. The office will be managed by a senior staff member with extensive experience in the coordination of incoherent scatter radar facilities worldwide.  InFO activities will draw on the expertise and experience of all the facilities, as well as other skills and capabilities within SRI. The coordination office will organize distributed skills teams comprising members who will remain embedded in their home facilities and institutions, but work together to address common issues for all the radars.  Initially, three distributed skills teams will focus on data analysis, transmitter technology, and international coordination of radar experiments. InFO will also support and mentor a postdoctoral scientist, who will serve as a liaison between InFO and the other incoherent scatter radar sites.  In the first year of the award, InFO will conduct a study evaluating the costs and feasibility of building an Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar facility at McMurdo in the Antarctic.  A workshop will be conducted in August 2011 to discuss the scientific needs and specifications for the Antarctic facility.  Finally, InFO will oversee the planning and organization of the successful AMISR summer school. The summer schools feature one week of intensive training and hands-on radar experience aimed at graduate students and other beginning users of incoherent scatter radar data.",
