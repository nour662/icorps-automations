 "awd_abstract_narration": "INTELLECTUAL MERIT \r\n\r\n ABC (ATP binding cassette ) proteins represent a gene family that has greatly expanded in plants, with twice as many members in Arabidopsis and rice (over 120) as any other sequenced genome of a multicellular organism (eg. human, worm, fly). The reason behind the expansion of this family in plants is unknown but hints to kingdom specific evolutionary constraints.  This project focuses on the Arabidopsis ABC protein, Atwbc19 (ABCG19), a member of a plant-specific clade.  Atwbc19 confers antibiotic resistance but the underlying mechanism is not clear. Preliminary results suggest that Atwbc19 does not function as a transporter but as a translational regulator. Thus the goal of this project is to demonstrate cleavage of Atwbc19 resulting in a soluble ABC protein, confirm its association with the translation apparatus and identify regulated transcripts. Ultimately, a new paradigm for antibiotic resistance in plants may be established.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT\r\n\r\n The project has three educational objectives. First, long term research opportunities will be provided to undergraduates.  Second, a research based course will be developed. And finally, research experiences will be provided in the traditional classroom through an upper level Plant Biology course. Overall, the project will contribute to the strategic goal of the College to increase student participation in research or internships from 30% to 100% by 2015. At the departmental level, the project will contribute to a curriculum that is being significantly revised towards a stronger emphasis on linking research to teaching. Ultimately, one goal is to inspire African American female students to engage in intellectual and personal development that leads them to Graduate School.",
