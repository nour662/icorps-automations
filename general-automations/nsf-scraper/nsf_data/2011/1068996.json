 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrical power system loads are functions of a myriad of power demands that depend on a variety of factors including time, weather, geography, and economics. The result of the aggregate behavior of many thousands of individual devices switching independently is power system loads that are stochastic in nature. Recent results have indicated that the determination of the stability (or instability) of the electric power system may be adversely affected by the random behavior of the loading patterns. Unfortunately, investigating these effects is hindered by the lack of appropriate algorithms with which to analyze large scale stochastic power systems. Therefore, in this project we will develop the appropriate tools to analyze the dynamic behavior of stochastic power systems.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\n\r\nThis area is extremely timely and pertinent as the level of stochasticity in the loads and intermittent generation sources increase due to renewable energy resources and plug-in electric vehicles. It is important to better understand the inherent risks associated with nondeterministic load models of the system to improve the reliability, resiliancy, and security of the electric power system. This project will address the stochastic factors that impact the transient stability of the electric power system and provide quantitative and qualitative approaches to security assessment and establishing security margins.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe project will provide an opportunity for educating a diverse engineering workforce in electric power systems. This project will support one women Ph.D. students. The PI and her graduate student will enter into a close mentoring relationship that will include one-on-one instruction not only in power engineering, but also ethical research practices, communication skills, and international awareness. The graduate students will also receive mentorship in classroom instruction and academic career preparation. Furthermore, the numerical methods developments will be incorporated into the next edition of the textbook authored by the PI on computational methods.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nElectrical power system loads are functions of a myriad of power demands that depend on a variety of factors including time, weather, geography, and economics. Renewable energy resources such as wind turbines or solar power can introduce uncertainty into the power system as a result of atmospheric variations causing excursions in active power generation. The variability of the electrical network loading has increased in recent years due to the expansion of renewable resources and the likelihood of wide-spread adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Plug-in electric vehicles are a potential significant source of disturbance on the grid, due to their battery charge and discharge characteristics. The tandem effect of renewable resources and PEVs may create uncertainties of such significant magnitude they adversely impact the operation of the power system.  The result of the aggregation of many thousands of individual devices are power systems that are stochastic in nature.  This implies that although the system behavior is generally predictable, it may also occasionally exhibit extreme behavior that could potentially lead to wide spread blackouts.\n\n \n\nIn this project, several approaches were developed to predict the stochastic behavior of the power system.  Improved prediction methods are necessary to better protect the power system against extreme events and to operate more economically under varying conditions.  The most promising approach developed was based on an approach to predict the stability margin as the distance between the desired (or stable) operating and the unstable boundary point.  The desired stable operating point is the point at the bottom of the \"bowl\" determined by the inherent energy of the power system as shown in Image 1.  The height of the sides of the bowl indicate the margin of stability.  The higher the sides of the bowl, the less likely it is that an extreme event will push the operating point up over the sides of the bowl into the region of instability.\n\n \n\nIn this project, a novel method for predicting the boundaries of the stochastic stable and unstable regions was developed.  Image 2 illustrates how the stability margin (the distance between the desirable and undesirable operating regions) can be maintained regardless of operating conditions, as indicated by the variety of behavior curves.  The curves define the probability of the system remaining in any bounded area.  If the power system starts in the desirable region of operation, the boundaries indicate that the probability of entering an unstable region where blackouts may occur is near zero.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mariesa L Crow"
