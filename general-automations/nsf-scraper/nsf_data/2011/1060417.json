 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supporting academically talented and financially needy Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics/Computer Science students by providing a total of 159 annual scholarships to freshmen, transfer and continuing students over its five year period. These scholarships enable students to complete a baccalaureate degree in these targeted disciplines and enter the workforce or go on to post-graduate education. Scholarships are being awarded with an extra emphasis on strengthening the Biochemistry and Chemistry programs. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Based on up-to-date research of best practices, this S-STEM program is increasing the number of Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics/Computer Science students who successfully complete their baccalaureate degrees in these fields. The management plan of this S-STEM project is based upon lessons learned from implementing an NSF CSEMS Scholarship grant. The Vice President of Financial Aid and Enrollment Management Functions and the Director of Career Development are integral to the planning of this S-STEM project. S-STEM students are being provided a comprehensive program of student support services including a learning community, advising, tutoring, peer mentoring, and research opportunities). An external evaluator is assisting in identifying programmatic needs as the project is implemented and evaluating its outcomes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics/Computer Science programs at the serve significant numbers of underrepresented minorities (30%) and female (53%) students many of whom will make up the much of the U.S. STEM workforce in the future. S-STEM scholarships assist academically talented and financially needy students to complete their degrees in the targeted fields.",
