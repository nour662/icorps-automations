 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Elon University Phase I Noyce Scholars Program, a partnership between Elon University and the Alamance-Burlington School System, is recruiting, preparing, and supporting during induction eighteen undergraduate Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics majors as they become secondary-level teachers.  Their recruitment begins with paid, education-related internships for fifty first- or second-year students (10 students per year). Among many valuable experiences, some participants serve as teaching assistants for Elon Academy, a college-access program for students with financial need and/or no family history of college. Two-year scholarships encourage talented STEM majors to complete a Teacher Education program to earn licensure (grades 9-12) in addition to their Bachelor's degree in Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, or Physics. Three cohorts (6 students per year) receive a $21,900 scholarship during both their junior and senior years. They benefit from Elon's close relationship with the Alamance-Burlington School System.  Field experiences in  high-need high schools prepare them to fulfill their teaching obligations. Their program is supplemented with special experiences, including documented extra mentoring by university and secondary-school educators. \r\n\r\nAs Elon Noyce Scholars are meeting their obligation to teach for four years in a high-need school district, they are supported through their induction into the teaching profession program, during which time they receive mentoring from secondary-school and Elon faculty, as well as receive financial support for professional development activities and the purchase of classroom materials. The PI and two Co-PIs administer the program, supported by an Advisory Board that includes STEM professors and secondary-school teachers, an Education professor, a university administrator, a STEM educator from a local community college, and an Elon STEM student. \r\n\r\nThe Elon Noyce Project attempts the novel integration of recruitment, preparation, and induction support with the intent to increase the quantity, quality, and longevity of Elon graduates as secondary mathematics and science teachers. It also aims to answer such research questions as: What recruitment strategies are most effective in attracting students to STEM education? What elements of Elon's teacher preparation programs do Scholars find most beneficial? How do Scholars compare with other new STEM teachers? How does the program affect teacher and K-12 student outcomes? Answers to these and other questions are infoming the future of STEM teacher recruitment, preparation and induction support nationally. An external Program Evaluator is measuring effectiveness and impact.",
