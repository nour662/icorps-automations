 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC \"Identification Technology Research (CITeR)\" with a focus on technologies of human measurement, identity, and intent that rest on firm pillars of trust, privacy, security, and reliability. The lead of the proposed Center will be Clarkson (CU) with site locations at the West Virginia University (WVU) and the University of Arizona (UA). \r\n\r\nTechnologies to measure, monitor, identify humans and human intent are needed for a broad range of commercial and security applications. The use of technology to both improve performance (e.g. as minimizing false alarms for a given desired positive detection rate) or improving user interface (e.g. speeding lines through airports) will have a strong benefit to society. The proposed center will seek advanced theoretical and analytical techniques for developing algorithms and assessing performance of tools and systems that for human and intent identification. Such tools are needed for a variety of applications, and the current state of the art provides significant room for advancement. \r\n\r\nThe proposed center builds upon the past success of an existing center that has been in operation since 2001. West Virginia University and University of Arizona have been the key players in CITeR since its inception, while others such as Michigan State have made notable contributions in areas such as image processing. In this proposal, Clarkson University as the lead institution adds complementary Center capabilities for measurements and signal processing to identity humans and human intent, and expands the center in an important way. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research plan represents an appropriate set of projects for comprehensively addressing needs in this area. The investigators are well-qualified to carry out the research, and many have a significant, well-respected research track record in their fields. \r\n\r\nCITeR will focus on research, education, and technology dissemination. CITeR's leadership with Clarkson to develop the Diversity 2050 Initiative program is an active program to identify and address educational needs of next-generation professionals in the identification technology arena, and is likely to lead to a broad-reaching and positive impact to higher education in these areas. The proposal lays out a clear plan for engaging the other CiTER sites in this effort. The proposed and re-organized CITeR will extend its research core while building on the solid foundation of the past. The proposed program builds on an existing center that has had great success since its inception in 2001, with more than 80 projects that have involved 22 faculty and 130 students.",

Undergraduate students play an active role in the data collection, research, and implementation of the software competitions. While students may at some point become associated with a research community at the university, we recognize the need to engage students earlier (e.g., freshman year).

Research on software-based liveness detection resulted to a series of publications and four patents and two applications licensed to a CITeR start-up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Software Competition and Dataset Release</strong> CITeR has sponsored the Liveness Detection Competition series (2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017).

In additional, CITeR?s focus on identification technology impacts \"improved national security\" by meeting the research needs of DHS, FBI, and DoD.\n\nSite specific examples of impact of CITeR research includes a university spin-out, patents, datasets and software tools.  Two software tools have been created:  the first open biometric cryptosystem tool for maintaining biometric privacy and development of face image quality framework on a GPU system.  A few outcomes are featured below.\n\nIP License and Startup: Given the world-wide visibility of Apple products, it was not long before it was demonstrated that the iPhone could be \"spoofed\" with a fake fingerprint. Research on software-based liveness detection resulted to a series of publications and four patents and two applications licensed to a CITeR start-up. \n\nSoftware Competition and Dataset Release CITeR has sponsored the Liveness Detection Competition series (2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017). In the last five years, over 600 requests have been made for datasets: ~75/25% academic/industrial, from 43 countries, and used in over 30 publications.\n\nDataset Release CITeR has funded collection and sharing of biometric data for research purposes, under IRB approval. One example of this data is Quality in Face and Iris Evaluation (Q-FIRE) where data was used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as part of its competition IREX II.  Information on release can be found on our website.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephanie C Schuckers"
