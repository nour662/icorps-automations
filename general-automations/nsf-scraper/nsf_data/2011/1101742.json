 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two main lines of investigation. The first is the classification of actions of finite groups on Kirchberg algebras (purely infinite, simple, separable,  nuclear C*-algebras). A theorem very similar to the classification of Kirchberg algebras satisfying the universal coefficient theorem should be possible at the very least when the group is cyclic of prime order, the action is in a suitable bootstrap class (as is required for the classification of algebras), and the action is pointwise outer. One expects classification up to conjugacy, not just cocycle conjugacy. Various extensions of this expected result are also under investigation. The second avenue of research is the study of the transformation group C*-algebras of free minimal actions of the group of integers, and the product of several copies of the group of integers, on compact metric spaces. In all cases, the objective is to describe the structure of these algebras. For the integers acting on an infinite dimensional space, the principal investigator seeks to relate the mean dimension of the action to the radius of comparison of the crossed product. For the product of copies of the integers acting smoothly on a compact manifold (and in some other cases), the principal investigator hopes to prove that the transformation group C*-algebra is stable under tensoring with the Jiang-Su algebra and that it has related good behavior. For the same group, but now acting on the Cantor set, the principal investigator would like to prove that the transformation group C*-algebra has tracial rank zero.\r\n\r\nThis project would have a number of broader impacts. First, one of the proposed results would provide a new and striking link with another part of mathematics.  Second, previous work of the principal investigator has connections with the study of the quantum mechanical behavior of an electron in a quasicrystal, and some of the work in this project has the potential to shed further light on this problem. Third, the principal investigator is active in supervising graduate students at one of the few institutions in the Pacific Northwest with a substantial Ph.D. program. Moreover, he is serving as an informal coadvisor to students at two other universities. Fourth, through continued research interaction with former graduate students, the principal investigator expects to help support mathematical research at primarily undergraduate institutions and to foster international cooperation with Mexico. Fifth, some elementary questions and numerical experiments related to the project can become undergraduate senior theses at the principal investigator's university. Such projects expose undergraduates to mathematical research, and thus advance the overall technological preparedness of the U.S.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n% To see the correct version, process with AMSLaTeX.\n\n\\documentclass[10pt]{amsart}\n\n\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\nThis project was concerned with Banach algebras,  primarily C*-algebras. The set $M_n ({\\mathbb{C}})$ of all $n \\times n$ matrices is an algebra: one can add, subtract, and multiply such matrices, and one can multiply a matrix by a plain complex number. (Multiplication of two matrices is not commutative: usually $a b \\neq b a$.) One can also form the adjoint $a^*$ of a matrix $a$: take the transpose and replace all the entries by their complex conjugates. A Banach algebra also needs a ``norm'',  which,   roughly,   is a measure of the size of an element. (For a matrix:  not how many entries it has,  rather, how large the numerical values of those entries are). There are many ways to make $M_n ({\\mathbb{C}})$ into a Banach algebra, but only one of them makes it a C*-algebra, namely the one in which the norm of $a$ is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of $a^* a$. This norm comes from letting $M_n$ act on ${\\mathbb{C}}^n$ in the usual way that matrices act on vectors, and taking the size of $\\xi = (\\xi_1,  \\xi_2,  \\ldots,  \\xi_n) \\in {\\mathbb{C}}^n$ to be\n\n\\[[\\| \\xi \\|_2 = \\sqrt{ | \\xi_1 |^2 + | \\xi_2 |^2 + \\cdots + | \\xi_n |^2}, \\]\n\nwhich is the immediate generalization of the usual distancein the ordinary three dimensional space we live in.\n\n\nThe algebra $M_n ({\\mathbb{C}})$ has dimension $n^2$: to specify an element of $M_n ({\\mathbb{C}})$, you need $n^2$ paremeters, since you have to say what each of the $n^2$ entries is. Most Banach algebras, and in particular most C*-algebras, are infinite dimensional.\n\n\nC*-algebras have applications to and connections withother areas of mathematics, including group representations(in oversimplified nonmathematical language, the study of symmetry), topology(which considers ``spaces'' like the surface of a sphere, the surface of a donut, or a space-time as in general relativity), and dynamical systems(think of something,  such as a solar system or a flowing fluid, whose state,  here the positionsand velocities of the planets,  moons,  etc. {}or the molecules in the fluid, changes with time). C*-algebras are also relevant to physics: quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.\n\n\nThere are two main directions to the outcomes of this project (as well as a number of somewhat related discoveries, omitted here). The first is the structure of C*-algebras associated to dynamical systems. The C*-algebra associated with an ordinary space turns out to be commutative. However,  the C*-algebra associated with a dynamical system involving an ordinary space is normally no longer commutative. This phenomenon is visible in the fluid flow example as follows. If you measure the temperature and then let a river carry you downstream for a while, the result is probably not the same as if you first let the river carry you downstream and then measure the temperature. \nThe dynamical systems I consider usually have discrete time (or discrete time together with discrete symmetries). This is simpler to deal with, and the analogous questions for continuous time are mostly still beyond the reach of current research. (I hope this will change soon,  and have plans in that direction.) They give ``simple'' C*-algebras; roughly speaking, it means the algebras can't be taken apart into smaller pieces in a reasonable way. The main results show that certain properties of the C*-algebra are determined by other properties of the dynamical system, although from just considering the properties separately there is no apparent connection.\n\n\nThe second direction is operator algebras on $L^p$ spaces. Suppose $1 \\leq p &lt; \\infty$. We make $M_n ({\\mathbb{C}})$ into a Banach algebra a different way, starting from the size measure on ${\\mathbb{C}}^n$ given by\n\n\\[\\| \\xi \\|_p = \\sqrt[p]{ | \\xi_1 |^p + | \\xi_2 |^p + \\cdots + | \\xi_n |^p}. \\]\n\n(If $p = 1$, this is the distance one must travel in a city with a rectangular street grid if you can't go diagonally because you must stay on the streets. ) Then we look at infinite dimensional versions of this algebra. People have previously paid no attention to such algebras, assuming there was little of interest to discover. I have found that there are interesting things to say. Some of the most important examples of C*-algebras have analogs in this new situation, with properties which are similar but not quite the same. Moreover, the theory is essentially different for every different choice of $p$. Although applications are not yet clear, this is a new and potentially exciting area of pure mathematics which has attracted interest from researchers and graduate students in several different countries.\n\n\n\\end{document}\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/17/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: N.
