 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: This collaborative research project aims to advance both scientific knowledge and synthesis of molybdenum disulfide in its atomically thin form. The research will elucidate the distinctive physical characteristics of this new material, including its electronic properties (band structure and its response to doping), optical properties (absorption, photoluminescence, and photoconductivity), vibrational properties (phonon frequencies and lifetimes), and its electrical transport properties (mobility and gating in different regimes). The principal investigators aim to develop a method for the synthesis of atomically thin MoS2 layers by a sequence of sulfur-loading of a copper surface followed by exposure to molybdenum. If successful, the research project will lead to practical methods to produce large-area samples of molybdenum disulfide in its atomically thin form and with controlled doping.\r\nNon-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The research elucidates the behavior in the single-layer limit of a semiconductor (as opposed to graphene, which is a semimetal and has no energy gap), contributes to our general understanding of materials on the nanoscale, and creates the basis for future applications of this and related material systems in electronics and optoelectronics. Graduate and undergraduate students are trained in an interdisciplinary environment. The project also promotes collaboration of scientists in two academic institutions with one of them being an accredited Minority Serving Institution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit:  \n\nThe subject of this research grant was  the growth, modification, and examination of the electronic properties of a new class of materials, ultrathin layers of transition metal dichalcogenide crystals.  These materials are similar to the single atomic layer of carbon forming the recently discovered graphene sheet, but have characteristics of a semiconductor, rather than the semi-metallic character of graphene.  The materials, however, share special properties of graphene, such as their ability to be stretched, to be electrically doped, and to be combined with a wide range of materials by stacking.  \n\nThe semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide layers, such as MoS2, investigated under this grant are model semiconductors that are stable down to a single layer thickness of less than a 1 nm.  Through a collaborative effort between researchers at Columbia University and the University of California, Riverside, new materials were grown, modified, and their electronic properties investigated.  The research at UC Riverside was largely focused on new ways to prepare these materials, while the research at Columbia University applied techniques based on optics and lasers to determine the properties of these ultrathin materials.  \n\nKey results concerning preparation of the materials include the demonstration that new alloys could be created by chemical synthesis with a chemical formula of MoSe2(1-x)S2x where x is an arbitrary parameter that allows tuning of the properties between the limiting structures of MoS2 and MoSe2.  Also treatment by energetic ions was shown to selectively remove the chalcogen atom S, which could then be substituted by Se.  Control of the alloy composition was shown to allow control of the energy gap of the material, a critical parameter both for basic physics and device applications. \n\nWith respect to the properties of these novel materials, the research program led by the Columbia team identified several new and unusual features in these ultrathin layers. When light is absorbed by a semiconductor, it excites and electron and leaves behind an effective positive charge or hole in the material. The resulting electron and hole can interact with one another through their mutual attraction, forming a new bound state in the solid know as an exciton. Because of their extreme thinness, studies of these materials' optical properties, carried out as part of the grant, revealed that the electron and hole attract one another with unusual strength. This is largely the result of less material between the electron and hole that can act to reduce (or screen) the interaction. \n\nAs part of this grant, research was performed to investigate these electron-hole interactions.  The studies revealed that not only could bound electron-hole pairs (known as excitons) be formed, but that three- and four-body bound states could also exist.  The former, known as a trion, is analogous to the hydrogen anion; the latter, known as a biexciton, is analogous to the hydrogen molecule.  Research performed as part of this grant identified these states and characterized their essential properties, such as their binding energies, i.e., the energies required to separate the bound states into their components.  \n\nBroader impacts:\n\nThe broader impact of this research lies in the fundamental understanding of new nanoscale materials and the methods by which they can be grown and modified. This knowledge has the potential to accelerate our development of new types of electronic and photonic devices based on control of materials on this very fine length scale.  Given the importance of electronic and photonic devices for computation, communication, and health, such advances have great potential.  \n\nThe second broader impact of the research supported by this grant lies in the training of new researchers.  The main use of funds from this grant was the support of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  In addition to contributing..."
