 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prior research has focused on deception detection, interrogation techniques, and the evaluation of confessions, all of which assume that perpetrators can recall with accuracy the details of their crimes. As other eyewitnesses (notably bystanders and victims) often exhibit incomplete and inaccurate memory for crime details, this assumption with regard to perpetrators may well be misguided.  This research project considers whether perpetrators and other eyewitnesses experience crimes differently. The expected differences are defined in terms of action, motivation, and arousal. The research plan involves three separate studies using an experimental format. \r\n\r\nThe current research will provide insights into perpetrator memory and the performance of perpetrators relative to other eyewitnesses.  The results will help to guide the evaluation of statements often taken from crime suspects and determine in general if the criminal justice system correctly utilizes or over-relies on perpetrator memories in its investigation and prosecution of crimes.",
