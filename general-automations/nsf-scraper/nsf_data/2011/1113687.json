 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project pursues the development of a novel volumetric efficient metamaterial antenna module for wireless and satellite communications, as well as radar applications. This Phase I project incorporates advanced metamaterials and textured ferrite composites to realize a broadband electronic bandgap (EBG) metamaterial as a means for achieving a dramatic profile reduction (<&#955;/60 in contrast to &#955;/4) in planar antennas. Phase I activities focus on development of the ultra-wideband EBG metamaterial, including the design and refinement of component materials, such as the specially designed textured ferrite substrates operating in the UHF to L frequency range with &#949;r<15, &#956;r>20, and tan&#948; &#8804; 0.05. In order to achieve operation at L-band, tuning of the cutoff frequency with magnetic fields of the order of 100-200 Oe will be employed. Further, broadband antenna and EBG metamaterials will be co-designed as a single component to enhance the antenna assembly performance, with bandwidths >40%, efficiency >60%, beam width of 100\u00a2\u00aa, and gains close to that of Chu's Limit. The development of advanced ferrite metamaterials represents a highly innovative and enabling advance in low profile antenna technologies.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes addressing the needs of both commercial and Department of Defense (DoD) markets. The proposed dual use low profile antenna technology holds the promise of significant performance improvements in height, weight, and aerodynamic drag reduction over current state-of-the-art technologies in wireless, satellite communication, and radar systems. The success of this Phase I project in improving the bandwidth and increasing volumetric efficiency of radio frequency front ends has an enormous potential to impact commercial communications and DoD industries and to stimulate the U.S. economy by producing advanced technologies and, importantly, high-skilled jobs. A recent global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) market report found the global value of GNSS products and services, currently at $3 billion, will grow at a compound annual growth rate between 19 percent and 23 percent, and reach $6 to $8 billion by 2012. This Phase I effort will be performed by a veteran-owned small-business. Employees include a woman as minority-owner and Chief Operating Officer and two students actively pursuing engineering doctorates. As part of this program, the students will be trained in all aspects of metamaterial and antenna design.",
