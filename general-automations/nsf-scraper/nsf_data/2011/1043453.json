 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational Science combines computer simulations and knowledge from a science discipline to solve complex problems.  While a decade ago computational science was rare and found mainly in research programs, today it is recommended even for K-12 education as an effective pedagogy for teaching science, math and computer science in context.  However, science and math teachers are often not prepared well for their work with computers in K-12 classrooms.  They may not be able to explain what is occurring within the computer applications used by their students.  The investigators are developing a new course for students who plan to be K-12 teachers, called Computational Scientific Thinking and Modeling for Teachers.  The course is designed to provide practical computation integrated into the scientific problem-solving paradigm and a contextual understanding of the important of computation.  This will lead to better prepared teachers, to better informed students and to broader participation in computing.  \r\n\r\nThe project represents a multi-institution collaboration among a computational physics educator, a science and math educator, an education foundation, a computational biologist and two community college science teachers.  Course materials include online content and a collection of video-based modules.  Student learning outcomes are being assessed and the results are being disseminated at national meetings for science and math teachers.",
