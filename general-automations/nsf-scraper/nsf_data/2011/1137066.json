The BASC is part of the National Academies, chartered by Congress in 1863 to provide independent science advice to government. The BASC uses volunteer experts to assist in the design of research studies and workshops and to review and assess findings and assess priorities. The BASC also facilitates US involvement in international research programs such as World Climate Research Program, Climate Variability and Predictability Program.\r\n\r\nThe BASC broadly impacts policy by synthesizing scientific information so it is useful to federal, state, and local decision makers. Thus this activity has substantial broader impacts.",
