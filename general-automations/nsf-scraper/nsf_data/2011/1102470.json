 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wealth of observations shows that the universe is composed of more than 96% invisible matter and energy. The nature of these missing components is one of the most fundamental mysteries in physics, and has attracted broad attention from the public. The leading candidate for the invisible \"dark matter\" is a subatomic particle left over from the big bang known as the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP). Such particles are also predicted by supersymmetry, a favored class of new particle models. If WIMPs exist, they are also the dominant mass in our own Milky Way. Although they very rarely interact with conventional matter, they should nonetheless be detectable by sufficiently sensitive detectors on Earth, through elastic scattering with atomic nuclei in a target material. \r\n\r\nThis award provides base support for work on the LUX (Large Underground Xenon) dark matter search experiment. LUX features a 300 kg two-phase xenon dark matter detector, which will be housed in a large water shield located in the Davis Cavern at the Sanford Lab in the Homestake Mine, South Dakota. LUX is currently beginning final integration of the detector, with surface operations expected to start in late 2010 and underground operations in late 2011. The Case group has had a central role in the design and construction of LUX and will play a major role in LUX operations and analysis.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The technology can be applied to other fundamental experiments such as double beta decay and solar neutrinos, and may give rise to new medical diagnostic techniques, or applications to Homeland Security and nuclear proliferation/verification. This group will participate in extensive education and outreach activities being undertaken by LUX in conjunction with Sanford Lab.",
