 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an effort aimed at developing, installing, and operating a modern all-sky imaging instrument to study airglow emissions over a site in northern Italy (an astronomical observatory of the University of Padua). The primary science rationale of doing so is to study Stable Auroral Red (SAR) arcs, Medium Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs), and gravity-wave signatures in the mesosphere.  Specifically, the new all sky camera will provide the first ground-based multi-longitudinal coverage for the SAR arc. In combination with the existing Millstone Hill all sky camera, the new camera will allow the examination of the longitudinal variations of the SAR arc, which is crucial for a better understanding of the SAR phenomenon and its relation to the dynamics of the magnetosphere and the ring current. On the medium scale TIDs, the new data sets will be used to explore the effects on source mechanisms in Europe, where the characteristics of geographic and geomagnetic latitudes, and the orientation of the geomagnetic meridians, are quite different from those found in the North and South American sectors that are the main focus of current on-going studies. Likewise, the orograhic differences between Europe and other continents will manifest into longitudinal variations in mesospheric gravity wave activities. The location of the new instrument in the Dolomite Mountain Range will enable the first study of source processes in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe research is fundamentally international in scope, building on a long-established, strong collaboration between scientists at Boston University and the University of Padua in the area of Planetary Atmospheres. The collaboration will be expanded with this effort to terrestrial atmospheric science, with involvement of a new set of students and research staff members from Boston and Padua. A dense network of GPS receivers and ionosondes, already operational within the field-of-view spanned by the imager, will contribute to the studies via collaborations set up with colleagues in Florence (Italy) and Bath (UK). These will be used, together with satellite over-flights, in multi-diagnostic studies by a multi-national team.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n    Airglow is the name given to a broad range of emissions from the Earth?s upper atmosphere that are initiated by a variety of internal chemical processes.  This definition is meant to separate airglow from the aurora, the emission of photons from atoms and molecules  via collisional excitation processes, i.e., via the precipitation of energetic electrons and ions from the magnetosphere.  Airglow can occur at any latitude or longitude on the globe, while aurora are generally confined to high latitudes in each hemisphere.  However, during large geomagnetic storms aurora can occur at remarkably low latitudes, e.g. 40-50 deg.\n\n     The altitude regions of airglow (nightglow) emission are found either in the Mesosphere (layers of sodium, OH and O between ~85 to ~110 km) or in the Ionosphere-Thermosphere ( multiple atomic oxygen emissions from ~250 to ~400 km).  We use optical images of such emissions to study processes, both photo-chemical and dynamical, that occur in the upper atmosphere.  While past data sets can be found from various world regions, e.g. North and South America, roughly 45o-75o W, and  Asia (India- Japan) in the Northern Hemisphere and Australia-New Zealand in the Southern Hemisphere.   This study uses data from two newly installed all-sky imagers in the Europe/Africa longitude sector.  These instruments were designed and built at Boston University.  Figure 1 shows one of these imagers and a schematic of the light path through the instrument.\n\n   These instruments are located such that they are on the same geomagnetic field line that passes about 13,000 km above the earth?s equator.  The northern camera is located in Asiago, Italy and the southern imager is located near Southerland, South  Africa .  Different wavelength filters are used to isolate the atmospheric emission lines of interest e.g. 630.0nm (red) for oxygen emissions from the thermosphere,  589.3nm(yellow) and 557.7nm(green)for sodium and oxygen from the mesosphere.   A high sensitivity, low noise CCD camera is used to record the images with exposure times ranging from 10 sec to 2 minutes.  The data is automatically sent back to Boston University for processing and archiving.  The data from 12 sites located across the globe are available for viewing at: www.buimaging.com.   Since the emission height above the Earth's surface can be ~400km ( e.g. for the 630.0 filter for oxygen), one of these all-sky images samples a region ~1500km in diameter.\n\n    The left hand panel in Figure 2 is an example of a Stable Auroral Red (SAR) arc that was observed from Asiago on September 26, 2011, during a geomagnetic storm.  The usual circular format of an all-sky image can be reformatted (right hand panel) to show what the view would look like to an observer looking due north (however, the SAR arc brightness is  about 20 times fainter than can be seen with the unaided eye). These storms (or \"Space Weather Events\") are caused by disturbances on the Sun that can send charged particles and bits of the sun's magnetic field toward the Earth causing disruptions in the Earth's magnetosphere, possibly affecting radio communications, causing power grid outages, and damaging geostationary satellites.  As this energy dissipates, we can sometimes observe mid-latitude aurora and SAR arcs.  Figure 3 is a schematic of the physical processes leading to the occurrence of a SAR arc.\n\n \n\n   The all-sky cameras only operate at night, limiting our observation of a SAR arc from one site to ~10 hours or so.  To get continuous coverage of an event,  we use three observation sites spaced around the globe in longitude so that when dawn approaches at one site, the next site to the west is still in darkness ( or ideally, just after sunset) allowing~10 more hours of observation.  This was the case on September 26-27, 2011 when a SAR arc was observed for 24 hours.  Figure 4 shows the location of that SAR arc in terms of its distance from the Earth?s center on the magnetic equatorial plane as determined from three all-sky imagers.  The light from a SAR arc comes from a height of about 400km above the Earth?s surface, but the region where the energy comes from is perhaps 13,000km high over the Earth?s magnetic equator.  The energy flows down the magnetic field lines to produce the light we see. The locations shown by the colored lines in Figure 4 were made by \"field line tracing\", using a model of the Earth?s magnetic field to follow the field line that goes through the visible SAR arc (at 400km) up to where it crosses the magnetic equator (the greatest distance from the Earth?s center for that magnetic field line).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/10/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey Baumgardner"
