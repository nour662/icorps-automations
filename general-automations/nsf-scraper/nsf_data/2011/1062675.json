 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the Chicago Botanic Garden will provide a ten-week research training for 10 students, during the summers of 2012-2014. The theme of this REU site is plant biology and conservation, spanning from genetic to ecosystem levels of inquiry. Faculty mentors include scientists drawn from the host institution plus Northwestern University and other area institutions. Students conduct research in plant evolution and systematics, pollination biology, rare-plant conservation, invasion biology, soil and microbial ecology, restoration ecology, biogeochemistry, climate science, and related disciplines. Projects typically involve both field and laboratory work. Students also participate in professional development activities, including a group collaborative research experience, workshops on scientific ethics and graduate school, field trips to the Field Museum and Morton Arboretum, training in scientific communication, and presentation of results at a public symposium. The REU program is integrated within a training continuum that includes pre-collegiate students, other undergraduate researchers, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, providing opportunities for REU students to serve as co-mentors to younger students and learn firsthand about graduate school. REU use laboratories equipped for research in ecology, soil science, genetics, reproductive biology, GIS, microscopy, population biology, geochemistry, isotopic analysis, and other areas of investigation. Students are recruited nationally through a variety of outlets and are selected based on academic record, past accomplishments, and research potential. Special efforts are made to attract students who lack extensive research opportunities at their home institutions and/or from groups traditionally underrepresented in the biological sciences. Students are tracked to evaluate the effects of this research experience on their future academic and career paths. Information about the program is assessed through follow-up surveys, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://www.cbgreu.org/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Daniel Larkin at dlarkin@chicagobotanic.org) or co-PI (Dr. Jeremie Fant at jfant@chicagobotanic.org).",

A survey of 50 top universities found that the percentage offering botany has dropped from 72% to 38% since 1988. These numbers were backed by a recent report revealing that the US will soon have a severe shortage in the number of trained botanists (botanical capacity) and educational opportunities (resource capabilities) supporting the advancement of plant science (Kramer et al 2014). As our REU Site is only one of a few in the country specializing in plant biology, it is helping to fill a growing gap in training opportunities. We aim to prepare students to pursue research-based graduate degrees and inspire careers in conservation research and practice. During the 10-week program, students are exposed to a wide variety of conservation careers, not only a traditional academic track, but also work in the non-profit, land-management, curatorial, and resource-agency sectors.</p>\n<p>Conservation of plants receives less attention than that of animals, but roughly one-third of the United States&rsquo; vascular plant species are vulnerable to being lost. Preventing these losses requires increasing botanical expertise to address current and future grand challenges and issues. For a total of nine years, CBG's REU Site has introduced 10 undergraduates each summer to research in plant biology and conservation through a 10-week internship program. Our program addressed two major challenges. The first was to complement traditional conservation with rigorous research into restoring degraded systems, preserving plant species in seed banks, and supporting species diversity in human-dominated landscapes. The second was to inspire and educate new researchers to move the field forward. We introduced students to these areas of inquiry through research opportunities ranging from fundamental questions in plant evolution to improving approaches for ecological restoration. Interns used study sites located at CBG, elsewhere in the Chicago region, and far beyond, with work that encompassed molecular, organismal, population, community, and ecosystem levels of analysis.
