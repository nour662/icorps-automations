 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit.  Gene flow between species is a natural process. The ubiquitous soil bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes naturally transfer some of their DNA to plants, leading to production of crown gall and hairy root diseases.  This ability to transfer DNA has been exploited for genetic engineering and is now the preferred method for delivering genes to plant cells.  Despite the widespread use, many mechanistic questions remain about how the gene transfer takes place. In A. tumefaciens, the VirE2 protein plays a major role by coating the transferred DNA and facilitating its uptake into the nucleus of the plant cell. However, this does not appear to be a universal mechanism, as some strains of A. rhizogenes transfer DNA efficiently, but lack VirE2.  Instead, these strains contain another protein, GALLS, that can substitute for VirE2, thus providing an alternate route for nuclear uptake of transferred DNA.  Apparently, upon entry into plant cells, GALLS localizes inside the nucleus where it interacts with a bacterial pilot protein attached to the transferred DNA and with a plant protein (GALLS-Interacting Protein; GIP). GALLS is hypothesized to act as a \"molecular tractor\" to pull transferred DNA into the nucleus. To test this idea, multiple experimental approaches will be used to understand how GALLS and GIP promote gene transfer via a VirE2-independent pathway. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  These studies will increase understanding of Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer and identify additional unknown components of this extremely important gene delivery system. This project will promote education and training of a doctoral student at Oregon State University and a postdoctoral associate at Purdue University.  In addition, minority undergraduates from Brooklyn College will be recruited to participate in summer research internships at Purdue.  After their summer experiences, the students will continue to engage in related hands-on research at their home institution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     Improvements in plant transformation are crucial to advance our understanding of plant biology and to improve crops to feed growing populations and overcome challenges posed by climate change.  Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer is the preferred means to create transgenic crops, which are planted on more than 100 million acres and save US farmers over $2 billion annually while reducing pesticide use by more than 46 million pounds.  Efficient delivery of single-copy transgenes is important for plant science and biotechnology.  Our studies aimed to increase our understanding of Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer, to discover novel components of this system, and to increase its efficiency.  We have succeeded.\n\n     Agrobacterium transfers DNA (genes) and proteins into plant cells.  The transferred bacterial genes can confer beneficial new traits to the plant, such as resistance to viruses, insects, or herbicides.  We discovered a bacterial protein (GALLS) that stimulates gene transfer to plants, apparently by silencing multiple host defense genes that normally combat bacterial infections.  This protein also incresaes the frequency of desirable single-copy transgenes, which are crucial for biotechnology applications.  Our work suggests strategies to improve both the quality and efficiency of transformation of crop plants.  Conversely, our work also suggests ways to engineer crops to resist infection by Agrobacterium and other pathogens.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lloyd W Ream"
