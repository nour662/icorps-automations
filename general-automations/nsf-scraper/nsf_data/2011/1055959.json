 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The objective of this project is to explore the radio frequency (RF) signal processing and sensing properties of optomechanically-coupled systems in the context of radiation pressure driven optomechanical oscillator (OMO). Specifically, the nonlinear dynamics of a microtoroid OMO will be studied in the presence of modulated optical pump and external perturbation. We will use the outcomes of the theoretical and experimental investigation to develop OMO based RF signal processors and biochemical sensors. Additionally, to support this primary goal we will demonstrate a novel hybrid optomechanical oscillator with enhanced performance and integration techniques that for the first time enable demonstration of fully integrated and efficient OMO based systems.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: New aspects of the nonlinear dynamics of an OMO will be investigated that can be exploited for practical applications such as homodyne RF down conversion and molecule detection. The idea of hybrid OMO proposed here will enable low power and low phase noise optomechanical oscillation at high frequencies. Also the proposed research aims to develop a new class of sensors based on simultaneous optical and mechanical monitoring using high quality OMO.    \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The multidisciplinary nature of this project stimulates collaboration among different departments at University of New Mexico. The PI has developed plans for collaboration with minority serving colleges and to reach out K-12 and post-secondary teachers and students. The principles and systems explored in this project will benefit the society through improvement of future RF-photonic communication systems and development of a new class of integrated biochemical sensors.",

One of these phenomena is the coupling between optical waves and mechanical vibrations in the so called <em>optomechanical</em> microresonators. Because of their special design and material properties, these micron-size devices can support optical power circulation and build-up within moving boundaries. As a result, the vibration of the structure can modulate the circulating optical power and the optical force (radiation pressure) can control the mechanical vibration. This mutual interaction can be used to amplify or damp the vibration of the corresponding boundary. Before this project very little effort was dedicated to physics and applications of radiation-pressure-based optomechanical amplification and its manifestation as optomechanical oscillation. The goal of this project was to explore the dynamics of radiation pressure driven optomechanical oscillators (OMO) and their applications in sensing and communication. During the course of the project we studied harmonic frequency generation and mixing in OMOs and developed a new method for locking the frequency and phase of an OMO to an electromechanical oscillator via acoustic waves. &nbsp;Also for the first time we demonstrated the functionality of OMO as a mass sensor, acoustic wave detector, radio frequency (RF) mixer, and refractive index sensor. Note that almost all molecule detectors rely on refractive index variations induced by the presence of molecules. As such a refractive index sensor can be used to detect and quantify molecules. While we used a glass based toroidal shape optomechanical microresonator for our demonstrations, the outcomes are applicable to all types of OMOs independent of their structure and material. In addition we have developed a new type of optical RF oscillator called thermo-optomechanical oscillator (TOMO) that its bi-frequency oscillation is sensitive to the refractive index of the surrounding medium.

The project had seven major outcomes: 1) Analysis of harmonic frequency generation in an OMO and demonstration of its application in refractive index sensing. 2) Demonstrating the first OMO based mass sensor where narrow linewidth of optomechanical oscillation combined with harmonic frequency generation result in sub-pg mass sensitivity (see Fig. 1 and 2). 3) Observation and characterization of a new type thermo-optomechanical oscillation in polymer coated silica toroidal microresonators and ZBLAN spherical microresonators that generates a unique optical modulation consisting of fast and slow oscillation periods. The application of this bi-frequency oscillator as a sensor was explored by demonstrating the sensitivity of the oscillation frequencies to humidity variations. 4) Proposing and analyzing a new approach for reducing the mechanical loss in OMOs based on phononic crystals (PnCs). 5) Full characterization of RF frequency mixing process and signal down-conversion in an OMO and demonstration of the first all-optical radio receiver that extracted the audio signal from an RF carrier using optomechanical interaction. 5) Developing a new technique for stabilizing the oscillation amplitude of an OMO based on optomechanical gain control through a feedback loop. 6) First demonstration of injection locking of an OMO via acoustic waves (the OMO phase and frequency were locked to an electromechanical oscillator (EMO) over 17 kHz with only 1 milliwatt of RF power fed to the EMO). 7)&nbsp;Study of acousto-optical response in optomechanical resonators and demonstrating that the reduced damping due to radiation pressure can be used for high sensitivity detection of acoustic waves.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader Impacts</em></strong><strong>: </strong>We have demonstrated several new applications for OMO that each can lead to useful technologies.

Given the variety of applications that may emerge in future, OMO can create many opportunities for developing new industries that will contribute to the prosperity, and welfare of US workforce.
