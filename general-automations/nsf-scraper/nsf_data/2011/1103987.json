 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for operations on two experimental initiatives in particle astrophysics: solar neutrinos with the Borexino liquid scintillator detector and dark matter with the DarkSide-50 liquid argon Time Projection Chamber (TPC). The nascent dark matter project will take advantage of the expertise in and facilities for low background methods accumulated by the Borexino collaboration in over two decades of research. DarkSide-50 will take advantage of the Borexino Counting Test Facility (CTF) and of the scintillator and water purification equipment built at the underground lab at Gran Sasso, Italy by the Borexino collaboration. While the Borexino and DarkSide collaborations remain two separate entities, almost all of the Borexino groups have joined the DarkSide Collaboration, and will work on both activities.\r\n\r\nBorexino is a detector designed to observe low-energy solar neutrinos. It is the most recent large-scale, real-time solar neutrino detector to become operational and has been in operation for a little more than three years, during which time it has acquired solar and terrestrial neutrino data. The solar neutrino goal is to improve the measurement of Beryllium-7 neutrinos to an uncertainty less than 5%, and to make the first real time measurements of other neutrino branches, especially the pep, and possibly also the pp and CNO neutrinos. DarkSide-50 is a 50-kg dual-phase argon detector under development for the direct detection of dark matter particles. It is designed to test innovative low background methods to ensure background-free operation. It will initiate the use of underground argon for dark matter applications. It will be deployed, enclosed in a liquid scintillator neutron veto, within the CTF water tank. The scintillator-water combined shield provides background-free operation for ton-year exposures.\r\n\r\nFor Broader Impacts, the proposed activity will advance the scientific and educational mission in a variety of ways: (1) it will offer an excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will have a chance to contribute to the success of a cutting edge project in fundamental science and advanced engineering; (2) it will benefit society by developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging; and (3) it will support continued development of successful E&O programs such as the Princeton-Abruzzo-South Dakota summer school for high school students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n&shy;NSF Borexino- Darkside Award 1103987 Final Report \n\nProject Outcomes Report\n\n \n\nBorexino:\n\nBorexino is a low background liquid scintillator detector that was designed to detect solar neutrinos. The goal was to develop a detector with a threshold and background low enough to measure neutrinos with energies less than 1 MeV, which would include most of the solar neutrino spectrum.  Borexino made the first measurement of 7Be 862-keV neutrinos in 2007, and by 2010, measured pep and 8B neutrinos.\nAfter a campaign of background reduction, Borexino made the first direct spectroscopic measurement of solar pp neutrinos produced in the primary proton-proton fusion reaction that powers the Sun, p + p &rarr; d + e+ + n. The measurements of pp, pep, 7Be, and 8B solar neutrinos, confirm for the first time, by direct measurements of the solar neutrino energy spectrum, that the Sun?s energy is derived mainly, from the proton-proton chain of nuclear fusion reactions. \nBorexino also set an upper limit on CNO solar neutrinos that confirms that the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen cycle contributes only a small fraction (~1%) of the Sun?s energy.  The first measurement of the small rate of CNO solar neutrinos, never observed so far, may be possible with Borexino if backgrounds can be reduced to a lower level.  Efforts to reduce backgrounds are underway, and a successful measurement of CNO neutrinos will help shed light on an important anomaly, the \"solar metallicity problem\".  \nThe measurements of solar neutrinos also provide confirmation for neutrino oscillations, and the prediction of the Mikheyev-Sminov-Wolfenstein (MSW) for the transition from vacuum oscillations for low energy pp and 7Be neutrinos to MSW matter-effect oscillations for high energy 8B neutrinos. \nBorexino?s results include the first measurement of geo-neutrinos with a 5&sigma; statistical significance, with very low background.  \n\n\nDarkside:\n\nDarkside-50 is a liquid argon detector with technical innovations that resulted in a \"background-free\" detector that is unique for searching for dark matter WIMP particles.  The new technologies that were supported partly with funds from this grant include the following:\n\nDevelopment of high efficiency detection of 128 nm argon scintillation photons that led to efficient scintillator pulse shape discrimination for rejection of background events due to beta rays and Compton scattered electrons.\nDevelopment of a high efficiency liquid scintillator veto to tag as background and reject nuclear recoils from scattering of neutrons that originate from radioactivity in the construction materials of the detector.  The combination of the liquid scintillator neutron veto surrounded by an active water shield also assures a low background from cosmogenic neutrons produced inside the detector and in the rocks surrounding the detector. \nDiscovery of deep underground sources of argon that was demonstrated by direct counting to have a much lower level of 39Ar radioactivity than normal atmospheric argon, which is under constant activation by cosmic rays.  The low-radioactivity underground argon is essential for achieving a \"background-free\" liquid argon dark matter detectors with fiducial mass of 1 ton, or greater.\n\n\nThe construction and successful background-free data from Darkside-50 with these and other innovations led to a proposal for a large 20-ton detector, Darkside-20, with high sensitivity to dark matter WIMPs. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/22/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frank P Calaprice"
