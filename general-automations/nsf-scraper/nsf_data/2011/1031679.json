 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ITEST strategies project titled Classroom Student Investigations, uses the popularity of the Crime Scene Investigation television show, involving forensic science investigation, as a metaphor to train teachers in forensic science topics and use that training in their science classrooms to stimulate and encourage middle and upper school students in science topics generally. The project is expected to lead to increased student interest in STEM topics using students interest in the culturally popular portrayal of forensic science to convey many basic STEM principles.  \r\n\r\nThe project has two research objectives: 1. to examine the impact on students interest in STEM careers in classrooms of participating teachers and 2. examine how participation in the program affects participating teacher implementation of reform based pedagogy and technology in their classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe project involves development of materials in a variety of forensic science topics and applied in a two week summer institute for participating teachers to convey content knowledge and develop laboratory skills using forensic science as an integrating theme.  The program expects to target 30 teachers a year and 120 students in one-day summer teacher workshops.  Teachers will then integrate the forensic topic curricula into their science classroom studies during the regular school year. The approach and the teacher training is expected to influence students in the science classes of the participating teachers and schools in the target area of the mid-South states.   \r\n\r\nBased on the success of the prior effort this project expands the training and development assistance and extends the training to schools in neighboring states of Tennessee, Missouri, and Mississippi.  Recruitment of teachers will focus on high-needs school districts.  This project will expand the amount of material available for teacher training; increase the teacher institute to 2 weeks; have teachers provide a workshop for students during the summer institute; provide on-going support for development of lesson plans and implementation of the new curricula during the school year for participating teachers and evaluate the progress of the expanded project towards its goals.",

Forensic sciences allow teachers to integrate a hands-on approach to teaching requiring critical thinking through a wide assortment of activities. Teachers then brought back these experiences to their own schools.</p>\n<p>Summer workshops were held for 7<sup>th</sup>- 12<sup>th</sup> grade teachers and attracted approximately 80 teachers representing over ten different states, ranging from California to Connecticut, with the majority being from the mid-South Delta region (Arkansas, Tennessee, and Missouri). Teachers were evenly split between junior high/middle school and high school, and most were female. University faculty taught content in a variety of domains including principles of radar, bacterial analysis, robotics, and entomology.</p>\n<p>During the academic year, teachers developed lessons to use in their classrooms. Teachers also conducted Family Science Nights, where attendees engaged in a fun, informal science education experience. Teachers developed many different variations of these events, including having them as part of a larger school experience, having students teach parents, or having students run the experience for younger students.</p>\n<p>In addition to the teacher institute, as part of the summer workshop, over 200 students from primarily rural areas came to a forensic science camp. Students went through a selection of the same modules as the teachers experienced, and were able to solve &ldquo;crimes&rdquo; with the help of the teachers in the program. The students also learned about STEM careers from grant personnel. Students were able to use a variety of scientific equipment, and learned about the nature of scientific investigations, the value of observation and data analysis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Intellectual merit</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>Teachers</em>: Many teachers implemented forensic science activities with their own classes during the academic year, using principles covered in the institute. Teachers reported the institute supported their activities, and they changed the way they taught as a result of participation. For instance, one teacher commented &ldquo;I changed some of my general approach to teaching to having more hands-on activities, and I was able to connect my state standards to CSI activities which made my science classes more engaging to my science students. I even started a school wide science CSI club.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>Students</em>: The camp had a positive and continuing influence on participants. Students&rsquo; feelings they could successfully &ldquo;do&rdquo; science increased immediately after attending the camp and remained higher than pre-camp levels a one year later. Students were able to articulate why they believed the camp had a long-term impact on their lives. Furthermore, participants attributed a higher level of engaging in additional informal STEM related activities during the academic year as a result of attending the camp. A year after the experience students made comments such as &ldquo;CSI camp was a great experience I will forever hold these memories close.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>Family science night</em>: Attending a family science night was highly beneficial and enjoyable for both adults and students. The adults indicated they had gained new information regarding children&rsquo;s interest in science. Furthermore, results revealed that virtually 100% of the adults were more interested in attending other science events with the children after their participation.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impact</strong></p>\n<p>The need to promote engagement in STEM is especially great in rural areas. Rural communities often face unique challenges in terms of STEM education, including high levels of poverty and students from a rural background are often under-represented in STEM careers.

Furthermore, several teachers used their experience to develop workshops that have been presented at state-wide conferences or assisted grant personnel in presentations given at national conferences.</p>\n<p>Our teachers have also continued to implement family science nights far past their original participation, which provides more access and exposure to STEM for these communities. For instance one teacher who participated in Year 1 sent us the following &ldquo;We just completed the Career Academies CSI Project for 2016. It just keeps getting better and better. It includes 166 high school students and 300+ 6th graders. We teach the high school students the labs then at CSI they do the teaching to the 6th graders.&nbsp; This year we had 21 lab stations (we started doing this with 12 stations).&rdquo; Another teacher, who is now an assistant principal, introduced a forensic science day into her school&rsquo;s curriculum. The entire school engaged in forensic-based activities, incorporating literacy, social studies, etc. into an applied curriculum, and helping students see the connections between different domains and the importance of STEM in everyday life. We believe these types of activities will continue to impact the students of our participating teachers, long after their formal participation in the project is concluded.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/07/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Karen&nbsp;L&nbsp;Yanowitz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1031679/1031679_10094587_1510075593315_DSC06219--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1031679/1031679_10094587_1510075593315_DSC06219--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"gel electrophoresis\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1031679/1031679_10094587_1510075593315_DSC06219--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"gel electrophoresis\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student loading a gel as part of CSI crime solving activity</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">gel</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Karen&nbsp;L&nbsp;Yanowitz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">gel electrophoresis</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1031679/1031679_10094587_1510075271616_DSC06152--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1031679/1031679_10094587_1510075271616_DSC06152--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"looking through a microscope\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1031679/1031679_10094587_1510075271616_DSC06152--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"looking through a microscope\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CSI students looking through microscopes</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Microscope</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Karen&nbsp;L&nbsp;Yanowitz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">looking through a microscope</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1031679/1031679_10094587_1510075792718_DSC06121--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1031679/1031679_10094587_1510075792718_DSC06121--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"field survey\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1031679/1031679_10094587_1510075792718_DSC06121--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"field survey\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students conducting soil analysis as part of CSI activity</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">field survey</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Karen&nbsp;L&nbsp;Yanowitz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">field survey</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
