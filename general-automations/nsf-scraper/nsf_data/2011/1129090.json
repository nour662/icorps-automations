 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: One of the largest outstanding and ongoing research problems in the physical and biogeochemical oceanographic community concerns the fate of organic carbon generated from primary production in the surface ocean. Though carbon export exerts a profound control on CO2 concentrations in the world?s atmosphere, in-situ measurements of production rates are not fully reconciled with those inferred from the global annual average, and the spectrum of variability of carbon export in a variety of oceanic environments has yet to be fully determined. A popular method for evaluating ocean metabolism is the formulation of an oxygen mass balance, in which an oxygen budget is constructed in the mixed layer or euphotic zone, the effects of physical processes are removed, and the residual oxygen production is stoichiometrically related to the export of carbon to depth. While ship-based oxygen mass balance studies are hindered largely by expense and the availability of resources, recent efforts using remote measurement of oxygen from moored sensors display considerable potential for cost-effective and geographically widespread diagnostics of the biological pump. These techniques have been expanded to mobile autonomous platforms such as profiling Argo floats  and ocean gliders, which offer an enhanced, highly-resolved vertical and horizontal picture of major physical processes controlling primary production.\r\n\r\nContinuing the evolution of studies of net biological oxygen production from autonomous platforms, the project will apply a comprehensive physical and oxygen mass balance assessment to a remote-sensing time series of unprecedented duration and resolution: the University of Washington Seaglider Ocean Station P time series in the southern Gulf of Alaska. Three separate Seaglider deployments orbited the well-instrumented National Oceanic and Atmospheric administration Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (NOAA/PMEL) Station P mooring from June 2008 to January 2010, collecting detailed vertical and horizontal profiles of basic physical properties, bio-optical variables, and dissolved oxygen. During extended portions of this time, the Station P mooring observed atmospheric variables and corresponding physical parameters within the near surface ocean; taken together these datasets represent a powerful tool for adding to the established picture of physical variability and net oxygen production in the central subarctic Pacific Ocean. In the course of our proposed analysis, we hope to: 1) better constrain horizontal advection, vertical advection, and diapycnal mixing processes, as they apply to the budget of an active tracer; 2) obtain a robust estimate of net oxygen production in the mixed layer during the course of the time series; 3) evaluate respiration (oxygen consumption) below the mixed layer and above the permanent halocline; and 4) estimate the dependence with depth of respiration below the pycnocline. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will expand the knowledge base of the physical dynamics controlling the biological pump in the Gulf of Alaska as well as add to the length of the time series which has been analyzed in a carbon export context. A better understanding of advection in the surface layer would allow comparison to previous residual estimates of this term and its relative importance at each phase of the seasonal cycle. Exploring the dependence in time and depth of diapycnal diffusivity would improve and clarify our knowledge of its role in vertical transport of oxygen at Station P. Additionally, analysis of a combined moored and autonomous vehicle time series should provide a foundation of techniques to be used in similar future deployments in difficult-to-observe regions of the world ocean.",

This project concerns the analysis of data from a combined array of sensors on both a fixed platform (a mooring) and an autonomous underwater vehicle to describe conditions at Ocean Station P in the central Gulf of Alaska from summer 2008 to winter 2010. \n\nStation P is an important place in studying the oceanography of the North Pacific Ocean because it is one of the few locations in the world where measurements of ocean properties that go back several decades.

Seagliders are small, human-sized robotic vehicles that use changes in buoyancy to alternately dive and climb from the surface to a thousand meters depth, several times per day, collecting measurements of temperature, salinity, and a few other basic properties as they go.  Since these vehicles are equipped with wings, their buoyancy-controlled vertical movements induce horizontal motion as well, so they glide along slanting paths through the ocean as they dive and climb, enabling them to navigate independently.  Provided that currents are not too strong, gliders can move around 20 km horizontally over the course of each day.\n\nFor the period they were deployed at Station P, these Seagliders recorded changes in the vertical and horizontal structure of heat and freshwater surrounding the NOAA mooring\u00c6s sensors and also flow structure and water properties somewhat deeper than the surface layer (where the mooring instruments were concentrated).
