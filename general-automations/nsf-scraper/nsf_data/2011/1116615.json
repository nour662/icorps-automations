 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project's main objective is devising a means to meet the challenge of excessive alcohol use by college students. The transition to the first year of college, in particular, is a critical age and life period when health and wellbeing are put to the test by the convergence of opportunity and peer pressure to drink heavily. Specifically, the project hypothesizes that adding the opportunity for role play in a web-based required online alcohol prevention program will improve the results compared to the web-based program only in a secondary prevention trial. All participants receive the standard alcohol prevention program required at the University of Central Florida (UCF), AlcoholEdu. Half of the randomly assigned participants have the opportunity to practice cognitive-behavioral skills through role plays. These immersive practice sessions are realistic in presenting situations that college students face in the real world. Armed with these skills and practice it is expected they will engage in less excessive alcohol use than those participants lacking this experience.\r\n\r\nA unique aspect of the proposed treatment is the use of a state-of-the-art interactive role play experience based on digital puppetry of virtual characters. Here, digital puppetry refers to the use of a human to control the actions of animated characters in real-time. Such artistry has been employed for several decades in a number of venues including television and location-based entertainment. Digital puppetry is currently employed by one of the PIs in education and peer-pressure resistance programs. By affording natural and highly versatile behaviors, puppetry greatly increases interactivity and immersion while affording flexibility in the appearance and traits of the characters and choices for the interactive scenes.\r\n\r\nAn evaluation of this type of alcohol secondary prevention technique with college students is an advance in the field. Specifically, it allows the investigation of whether one-on-one virtual role-plays (e.g., a party scene in which college students can practice refusing to join a drinking game) can help students avoid difficult peer pressure situations. It could provide a new method to enhance and complement the programs currently used for alcohol secondary prevention.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project \"Reducing Alcohol Use Among College Students Using Virtual Role Playing\" was a collaboration between a computer science virtual reality team and a public health researcher specializing in the causes and prevention of alcohol use.   In particular, we chose to focus on excessive drinking and its consequences (e.g., drinking and driving) among college students who are at great risk of engaging in these behaviors.  The major goal of the project was to develop and conduct a preliminary test of a virtual role playing scenario with an online alcohol prevention program.  Specifically, this was done to help college students develop protective strategies against excessive alcohol consumption and its consequences.   Another major goal was to provide the opportunity for students to practice these strategies in realistic but safe scenarios that involve peer pressure in a realistic virtual off-campus party setting.   College students found the scenario believable, helpful and a great exposure to peer pressure experiences with alcohol.  In a preliminary test of outcomes, comparing students who role played using virtual reality with an online required university alcohol prevention program  to those only receiving the online required alcohol program no differences were found  (e.g., protective strategies like \"How many times did you alternate alcoholic and non&shy;alcoholic drinks?\"; \"How many times did you set a limit on the number of drinks you consumed?\"; \"How many times did you keep track of how many drinks you consumed?\"; \"How many times did you eat before and during the time you were drinking?\"; \"How many times did you pace and space drinks?\").  All the analyses controlled for age of participants, as age has been associated with greater drinking and risker behavior.  Virtual reality participants were significantly more likely to (1) try to stop somebody they knew from deciding to drive after drinking and (2) use a designated driver than students in the control condition.  The findings involving greater likelihood to engage in behaviors related to drinking and driving advance our knowledge in this area by showing that virtual role playing offers promise in influencing college students stopping others they know from driving after drinking and using a designated driver.   Future research needs to refine the scenario further, use a larger number of participants and determine if other alcohol-related behaviors or protective strategies can be impacted.  This research offers the promise of benefiting society by potentially influencing college students' behaviors and consequences of drinking alcohol to excess.   This is a major public health problem preventing drunk driving.   Moreover, this benefits not only the students from being victims of car accidents but also the rest of the public who come in contact with them.   Again, this is very promising but more research needs to be done to prove the effectiveness of these techniques with a larger group of college students in affecting excessive alcohol consumption and/or drunkenness, as well as its consequences.   Moreover, strategies that work in helping prevent these behaviors and consequences also need to be identified.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/23/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles E Hughes"
