The conference will provide a venue for presenting the science, novel technologies and advances of in vitro biology for both plants and animals.  As such, the meeting provides an outstanding opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers. Funding provided by NSF will broaden participation by defraying the costs of participation for students and postdoctoral associates with specific emphasis on women and those from underrepresented groups.",
