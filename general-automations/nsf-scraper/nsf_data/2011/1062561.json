 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho. The objectives for the students participating in this REU site are:  1) Introduction to the excitement of physics research through active participation in research, 2) Training in the scientific method and the ethical dimensions of scientific research, 3) Development of team-building skills, 4) Scientific career awareness development, and 5) Diversity awareness development by recruitment of students from traditionally underrepresented groups. The Idaho physics faculty will design research projects that are challenging yet viable. Both theoretical and experimental projects will be made available. The students will be encouraged to work in small groups to foster teamwork skills. Weekly meetings will be held to allow the students to interact and to keep each other posted on their progress. The REU students will interact with Idaho faculty, research staff personnel, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduates. Supplementary activities will include weekly lunch together with faculty and weekend activities that revolve around the tremendous outdoor experiences available in Idaho. The program will conclude with REU student research presentations.  The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
