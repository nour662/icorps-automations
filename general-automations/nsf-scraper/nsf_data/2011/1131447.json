 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ongoing technological revolutions continually bring forth new research challenges and myriad research communities within Computer Science usually respond to them on their own. It has been generally recognized that we need tighter collaboration across these communities: researchers from different communities working jointly \"in the field,\" constantly informing each other, inventing in their respective areas in response to their experience in the field, and forging systems and solutions that are simultaneously validated by both algorithmic and systems communities. Such an experience will produce algorithms that are practical as well as powerful, and systems and applications that are efficient and effective, without working to make independent research threads meet ex post.  We believe that the time is appropriate for \"Algorithms in the Field.\" We propose to initiate discussions and collaborations on understanding the challenges and promises of algorithmic foundations in various CS fields, and further establish the vision of algorithmic foundations forged in these fields in practice. The development of successful examples will increase awareness that collaborations across the subdisciplines should be customary, and not exceptional. The main goal of the workshop is to provide a working vision for such examples of Algorithms in the Field, and a prioritization of near term goals and directions for scientific investigation.",
