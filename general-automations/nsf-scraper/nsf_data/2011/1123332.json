 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite widespread development and dissemination of research-based practices that can reverse the gender imbalance in computer science, typical teaching practices make computing less inviting to women than to men and lead to women's greater attrition.  Women's participation in computing is lower than it is in nearly every other STEM discipline and unique in its downward trend.\r\n\r\nThis project is a triangulated study to identify the conditions that influence computer science (CS) faculty members' adoption of practices that improve gender diversity in CS.  Data are being collected using observation, interview, and survey methods. The analysis includes qualitative data interpretation and statistical regression methods.  After piloting, the national survey is planning over three hundred responses. Findings are expected to advance knowledge about faculty adoption of effective teaching practices, faculty adoption of gender inclusive practices, and diffusion of innovative teaching practices.  The PIs and consultants are contributors to the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT).  An advisory board of scientists with extensive experience will ensure that all facets of the research are of the highest quality. Active dissemination of results is designed to inform scholars, policy makers and practitioners.",
