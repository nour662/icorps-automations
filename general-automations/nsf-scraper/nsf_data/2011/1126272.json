 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's request funding to develop an autonomously, deployable, deep-ocean seismic system to provide long-term and near-real-time seismographic observations from sites far offshore. Building upon two proven technologies, autonomous wave-powered surface boats and ocean bottom seismometers, the proposed new generation instrument will, if successful, provide a means of increasing global coverage not only of seismic observations, but also of a variety of ocean bottom observables in an affordable, practical, and sustainable way. Real-time data from stations in oceanic areas will significantly increase the accuracy of earthquake parameters such as location and moment. Such global seismographic data are critical for both national and international agencies in monitoring and characterizing earthquakes, tsunamis, and nuclear explosions. This is particularly critical for tsunami warning systems. This new generation instrument will provide a means of increasing access to not only seismic data, but also to a variety of other ocean bottom observables over the global oceans.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThis new capability would make it realistic to consider the deployment of seafloor observatories in any remote areas of the oceans. In addition to addressing fundamental questions of Earth structure and tectonics, providing real-time data from stations in oceanic areas will significantly increase the accuracy of earthquake parameters such as location and moment. Such global seismographic data are critical for both national and international agencies in monitoring and characterizing earthquakes, tsunamis, and nuclear explosions. This is particularly critical for tsunami warning systems.",
