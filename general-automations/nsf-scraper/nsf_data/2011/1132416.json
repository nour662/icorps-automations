 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this CAREER research and education plan is to study a novel ceramic ZnO nanowire interface recently identified by the PI to study the role of a nanowire interphase on the mechanical and multifunctional properties of a fiber reinforced composite.  This fundamental study will develop a theory defining the translation of the properties from the nanowire interface to the macroscopic response and characterize the failure mechanism of the interface.  Both experimental and theoretical analyses will be employed to study the structure-property relationships of the interface and their influence on the material?s mechanical and functional response.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research extends beyond carbon fiber composites with potential scientific findings that can be applied to continuous and discontinuous fiber reinforced metal and ceramic matrix composites.  The effort may also lead to new methods for functionally grading other interfaces such as those found in prosthetics and biological implants leading to new biologically inspired interfaces which rarely exhibit discrete boundaries between two materials of vastly different mechanical properties.  Fundamental advances in the modeling of composite systems with active nanoscale inclusions in the interphase will be accomplished, resulting in future applications of this technology, ranging from self-monitoring biological implants to energy harvesting structures.\r\n\r\nThe educational component of this CAREER plan is designed to transfer state-of-the-art research to the classroom and enhance engineering recruitment and retention by targeting students from middle school to graduate level. A Family Engineering Night (FEN) has been planned which will incorporate ASU undergraduates from four minority student groups, a research-driven course in nano and multi-scale composites, and the continuation of a strong undergraduate research program. The purpose is to enhance recruitment and retention of engineers, including minorities and underrepresented groups, and motivate students to commit to a life-long process of learning and sustained involvement in science and engineering fields.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the most important factors in the design of a fiber reinforced composite is the quality of the fiber/matrix interface.  Carbon nanotubes and silicon carbide whiskers have been used to enhance the interfacial properties of composites; however, both have led to the significantly reduced in-plane strength of the composite.  This CAREER effort has studied a novel ceramic ZnO nanowire interface on the mechanical and multifunctional properties of a fiber reinforced composite.  The over-arching objective has been to gain a fundamental understanding of how the properties of nanoscale features at the interface of fiber reinforced composites translate to those of the bulk material. The research demonstrated that the growth of ZnO nanowires on the surface of carbon fiber could lead to as high as 327% improved interfacial strength without any loss in fiber strength.  This research program has studied both the mechanics of this interface and the bonding mechanism, which has lead to the strong adhesion as well as the multifunctional behavior endowed to the composite by the piezoelectricity of the ZnO.  It was hypothesized that the presence of oxygen functional groups on the fiber surface generated strong interaction with the ZnO and a range of surface functionalization processes and molecular dynamics simulations were developed to evaluate this. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated that the strong bonding resulted from the presence of oxygen functional groups on the surface of the fiber. Additionally, AFM liftoff studies were performed to validate the MD models and showed excellent agreement, which is to the best of the PIs knowledge the first validation of an MD simulation of a solid-state interface.  The results and MD models can now be used to redesign the interface such the optimal properties can be provided to the composite.  With the interfacial strength being a critical parameter in the design of composite materials, this work has undoubtedly provided the fundamental science required to improve composite materials and potentially achieve unprecedented properties.  The effort has also developed a multi-inclusion modeling process for the prediction of the electromechanical constitutive properties of composites with a nanowires interphase.  FEA results were used to validate the accuracy of the approach and it was applied to a ZnO nanowire interphase showing a significant variation in the mechanical properties as a function of the nanowire length.  Furthermore, we have demonstrated for the first time a multifunctional composite which can provide piezoelectric behavior for embedded sensing while simultaneously increasing strength by 35% and increasing damping by more than 200%.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Henry Sodano"
