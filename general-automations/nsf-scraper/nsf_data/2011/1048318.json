 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, the proposing team will investigate the evolution and decay of active regions in the solar atmosphere. This effort will focus on the physics of active region decay because of its importance to the solar cycle dynamo and for determining the detailed magnetic structure of both small-scale and global phenomena in the solar corona. \r\n\r\nThis effort is motivated by the fact that solar active regions (seen as sunspot groups in the photosphere and bright knots of X-ray emission in full disk coronal images) are the largest and most important contributors to solar activity. Solar eruptive phenomena (such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, or CMEs) and nearly all of the observed X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation that reaches the Earth are linked to active region magnetic fields, but the life cycle of these active regions is not yet well understood.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Inverstigar (PI) notes that active regions are an important driver of space weather and that this work will therefore have an impact on operational forecasts, especially of the global magnetic properties of the Sun and large-scale CMEs. The PI's team will provide their numerical codes and datasets to the community for testing and validation, and they expect that their numerical techniques will have many additional applications. The proposing team's tools will be made available under an open source license for use in a wide range of studies in which radiative MHD models are needed.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major outcomes from this funded project can be summarized in terms of three accomplishments:\n\n(1) Funding from this grant enabled the development of a new computer code, called RADMHD2, which will allow for a more complete ability to quantitatively describe how magnetic fields on the Sun evolve over time.  The code includes the Sun's spherical geometry, and can model the Sun's magnetic field from below its visible surface into the outer corona, the part of the Sun's atmosphere one can see during a solar eclipse.  The computer code was developed by Bill Abbett and Dave Bercik at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory.\n\n(2) We derived and published a technique for evaluating the magnetic forces over large volumes of the solar atmosphere that make use of measurements of magnetic fields on the Sun's photosphere, its visible surface.  Our results have been used extensively by observational solar scientists in their analysis of the dynamic evolution of the Sun's atmosphere during large, eruptive solar flares.\n\n(3) With partial support from this grant, we have developed the ability to compute electric fields in the solar photosphere, by observing the time evolution of magnetic fields in the photosphere.  This ability is important because it enables the ability to measure the flux of energy leaving the photosphere and entering the solar corona, and because electric fields are needed to drive dynamic models of the Sun's atmosphere.  This would be a required ingredient in future models that might be able to forecast dynamic solar events.\n\nWe are very grateful to the US taxpayers for making this research possible.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/23/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George H Fisher"
