 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NRAO Summer Research Experience in Astronomy for Undergraduates [REU] and Teachers [RET] program provides stimulating internships to students interested in research in astronomy and exposure for K-12 teachers to the process of scientific investigation. During their appointments, the participants will work with NRAO scientific staff advisers on a project in the advisor's area of expertise: astronomy and astrophysics, research engineering, or computer science.  Students and teachers alike will also take part in a summer lecture series introducing them to the fundamentals of astronomy and to current topics in astronomical research. Teachers may additionally take part in workshops, and participate in educational sessions to develop classroom activities that make use of their research experience at the NRAO. All REU and RET activities are intellectually focused on providing the environment and infrastructure within which students and teachers can learn and master the tools of basic research.\r\n\r\nThe NRAO REU/RET project will provide research experiences to fifteen undergraduate students and four K-12 teachers per year.  This, combined with the additional summer interns funded from NRAO operational funds, will bring the total number of summer student interns to 25 to 30 per year.  Over the 53 years during which NRAO has supported a summer internship program, the majority of the student participants ultimately choose to pursue careers in science and engineering.  Some students forge continuing collaborations with NRAO scientists, forming links between NRAO and their home institutions.  Additionally, some students participate in important public outreach activities.  Teachers take part in workshops and sessions on curriculum development.  They are also directly exposed to research which enhances their teaching, fosters enthusiasm for science in their students, and influences some of their students to pursue scientific careers.",
