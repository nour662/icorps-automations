 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tropical Ocean tRoposphere Exchange of Reactive halogen species and Oxygenated VOCs (TORERO) field campaign will deploy the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V research aircraft over the tropical and subtropical Eastern Pacific Ocean in early 2012 to investigate the release of reactive halogen species (RHS) from biologically active coastal waters and open ocean upwelling regions (termed oxygen minimum zones, OMZs). Observations and modeling studies corroborate the global presence of RHS and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOC) in the free troposphere (FT), yet important gaps remain in our understanding of remote ocean sources, and the effects on atmospheric chemistry, and potentially climate. TORERO will investigate three hypotheses: (1) OVOC and RHS released from the remote ocean impact atmospheric composition in the FT as a result of deep convective transport; (2) the ocean sources of VOC precursors, and the abundance of OVOC and halogen oxide radicals varies between open ocean areas with biologic activity, coastal upwelling and the ocean deserts, and (3) reactive gases released from the ocean are relevant to chemistry and potentially climate through ozone destruction, methane oxidation, and aerosol formation.\r\n\r\nTORERO research will support two graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar in an environment where interaction with Hispanic culture is part of the daily routine during the field phase in Ecuador and Chile. University researchers will be provided with access to a unique aircraft facility, several unique instruments, and a network of scientists from federal laboratories (NCAR, NOAA). TORERO results will be made available for use by the scientific community. The project will benefit society by advancing understanding of ocean-atmosphere interactions to improve predictive capabilities and better prepare for climate change.",
