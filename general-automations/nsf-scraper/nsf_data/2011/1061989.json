 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECONOMICS OF A LIGHT BULB: EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE ON CFLS AND END-USER BEHAVIOR \r\n\r\nEliana Carranza and Robyn Meeks \r\n\r\nAbstract \r\n\r\nResidential access to modern energy and lighting is considered to be important for development as \r\nit improves living standards and productivity. However, developing countries can face severe \r\nconstraints on available electricity. As a consequence, residential electricity use is limited and \r\nhouseholds pay prices that can be as high as those observed in wealthier nations. In the developing \r\nworld, where lighting is a major component of residential electricity consumption, energy efficient \r\ntechnologies such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) can offer electricity savings and allow more \r\nenergy services. Still, where CFLs have been introduced in developing countries through mass \r\nreplacement programs at a zero or subsidized price, their use is often discontinued once the \r\nconsumer is required to pay the full price. This represents a major constraint to realizing the \r\npotential impacts of energy efficient lighting. \r\n\r\nTo better understand the adoption, continued use, and diffusion process of the CFL technology, this \r\nstudy uses randomized experiments to inspect two major mechanisms: (1) the ?rebound? effect, \r\nwhich is the result of behavioral responses that boost consumption and offset CFLs? technologically \r\nfeasible electricity savings, and (2) the role of ?peer? networks in spreading information on a new \r\ntechnology. Although the initial adoption of CFLs may be limited because the willingness to pay \r\n(WTP) is lower than the market price, their diffusion may be restricted if information is too noisy or \r\nif a greater importance is put on negative rather than positive information. \r\n\r\nThe study furthers knowledge on the behavioral barriers that arise from end-user interactions with \r\nenergy-efficient technologies. The findings are relevant to several aspects of energy conservation \r\npolicy. Examination of the rebound will inform the optimal combination of innovation and price \r\npolicies and the trade-off between welfare and electricity conservation. Examination of peer-\r\nnetworks will discern between different learning mechanisms and tell how best to advance CFLs? \r\ndiffusion. Lastly, WTP studies assist in developing strategies for optimal pricing and subsidies. \r\nBeyond the policy relevance for CFL programs deployed recently in developing countries, lessons \r\nlearned regarding responses to energy efficient technologies have behavioral implications that are \r\nalso relevant to developed countries.",
