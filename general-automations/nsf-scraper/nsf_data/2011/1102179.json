 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to establish the technology for electrical control of droplet-ejection direction for coalescence of multiple directionally-ejected droplets (up to 21) in air. Coalescence of such a large number of nanoliter droplets midair is unprecedented, and is transformative as it enables midair micromixing, synthesis, analysis, etc. Fundamental studies will be performed to elucidate the underlying physics of directional droplet ejections by a focused acoustic beam, to eject nanoliter droplets with electrically controllable directions, and to merge a large number of ejected droplets in air. \r\nThe intellectual merit is in the electrical controllability of the direction in which the droplets are ejected, its usage in merging simultaneously-ejected droplets in air, and the novel applications of the midair coalescence. The electrical controllability of the droplet direction will allow fine control of the direction, droplet-coalescence, and ensuing event after the coalescence. Array of multi-directional droplet ejectors capable of varying their ejection direction over a wide angle will be developed and used for automated screening of protein crystallization.\r\nThe broader impacts are on cell separation and/or lysis, protein synthesis and/or crystallization, complex combinatory analyses at high throughput and great precision, etc. The results of the proposed fundamental studies will be incorporated into the interdisciplinary curriculum at the investigators' institution. Also, several undergraduate students, particularly from underrepresented groups, will be included in the research. Moreover, local inner-city high schools in south Los Angeles will be offered some droplet ejectors with which the high school students can experiment in their science labs.",

The experiment results on the protein synthesis showed that SFATs were ideally suited for synthesizing proteins on a glass slide with SFAT-ejected peptide droplets. Since SFAT does not use a d..."
