 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) is an evanescent wave refractive index measurement made at a metal-coated surface and has been demonstrated to be a quantitative, sensitive, and label-free technique for measuring the binding kinetics of proteins, DNA, cells, and small molecules to surface-immobilized capture agents. The combination of imaging with SPR (SPRI) allows sensitive and accurate quantification of cell areas and dynamic changes in cell-substrate interactions such as membrane ruffling. SPRI also affords quantification of secretion of proteins from cells, and changes in surface protein density as a function of time and location. The custom-designed SPRI will aid researchers in studying adsorption of peptides, nanoparticles, proteins and other bioconjugates on polymers, self assembled monolayers and even live cells in culture.  The fluorescence microscopy configuration will enable the capture of cell morphology information, spatial distributions of ligands and receptors and competitive molecular uptake studies which when coupled to the adsorption and kinetic data from SPRi will provide opportunities for quantitative and statistical measurements of cell material interactions.  In 2009, Dr. Becker initiated a long-term outreach effort with St. Vincent / St. Mary High School (STVM).  It has grown to include 10 additional faculty members at UA. Uniquely, EVERY year, at each grade level, EVERY student is required to complete a year-long, inquiry-based science project as part of the science curriculum.  The science inquiry method encourages students to ask in depth questions and then to apply themselves, including conducting experiments, to find the answers, rather than merely memorize facts.  The students research and identify a problem that they proceed to solve or answer by carefully and methodically performing experiments, conducting research and consulting with the teams of faculty, graduate students, high school teachers and students.  Results are formulated into ACS POLYMER PREPRINT style manuscripts. Collectively the efforts of 11 teams (student, faculty, teacher) led to STVM in winning the Harold C. Shaw Outstanding School Award and named as the outstanding high school science program in the State of Ohio in both 2010 and 2011. We aim to use real data collected by the students in the science inquiry program to demonstrate physical phenomena of refractive index, optical adsorption and protein adsorption which will be incorporated into new modules in the high school physics curriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe interactions of molecules with surfaces play an important role in many biological and physical processes. The adsorption of these biomolecules are important for designing materials that have antimicrobial properties, developing scaffolds for tissue engineering, bone growth, and drug delivery. The acquisition of Imaging Surface Plasmon Resonance Instrumentation (SPR) will provide information on adsorption of proteins, peptides and nanometer-size particles on surfaces. This new capability at the University of Akron (UA) will provide opportunities for students and faculty members in twelve research groups to investigate fundamental and applied problems in the area of biomaterials. This additional capability will accelerate the development of new biomaterials and provide important training to graduate and undergraduate students.  In addition local high school students participating in a year-long science inquiry program at UA will use the instrumentation to study kinetics of adsorption.  We aim to use real data collected by the students to demonstrate physical phenomena of refractive index, optical adsorption and protein adsorption which will be incorporated into new modules in the high school physics curriculum.",
