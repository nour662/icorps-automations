 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tufts University Noyce capacity building project aims to bolster Tufts' newly instituted Master of Arts in Teaching Engineering program that prepares engineers as grades 5-12 engineering teachers. \r\n\r\nThe project team composed of faculty from Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, and Education recognizes the need for a multi-faceted approach:\r\n1. Attract and recruit engineering undergraduates and practicing professionals to become engineering teachers, \r\n2. Build partnerships with local schools and engineering teachers to serve as M.A.T. in Engineering candidates cooperating teachers, and \r\n3. Effectively prepare M.A.T. in Engineering candidates through innovative coursework, engineering faculty advisors, and other programmatic supports.\r\n\r\nThe approach includes new course development where engineering faculty work with education faculty to incorporate education themes and ideas in graduate level engineering content courses and year-round programming with all stakeholders (undergraduate engineering students, M.A.T. candidates and graduates, cooperating in-service teachers, and engineering and education faculty).   \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project rests upon the pioneering endeavor of preparing engineers and K-12 engineering teachers. Integrating engineering into the K-12 classroom has become a popular notion and the Prepare Engineers to Educate Now project looks to address one of the major hurdles in making this happen more broadly creating highly qualified engineering teachers. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts rest on the communities served by Tufts and its graduates, but the goal is to inform other institutions through the evaluation of the project includes  measuring the effectiveness of  recruiting strategies, partnership strategies, and courses in developing teachers' knowledge and practices.",

Starting in the spring 2012 semester with eleven students (and expanding to 17 the following year), the students worked in small groups (often pairs) on some self-chosen, personally-meaningful educational initiative. Established through discussions under the supervision of Danahy and Hynes, these ranged from curriculum development, supporting engineering design, and new software or hardware development (and often, a combination of multiple). From this experience, new technologies, activities, and curriculum emerged as developed and tested by the interns. To support the process, the students attended bi-weekly meetings where undergraduate students, along with Hynes and Danahy, reviewed education literature, collaboratively discussed their projects, and provided each other insights and structure to support the progression of their work. The projects enabled the students to leverage their engineering expertise while engaged in the development of solutions that required considering the students and teachers as the clients and formal education classrooms as context. The main goal behind this experience, beyond developing new educational tools, was to expose these undergraduate interns to issues within education and tap into any passion or interest they may have related to that context, and possibly inspire them to consider becoming teachers themselves.\n\n \nEd MAKER Intern Program Continuing to explore ways of engaging engineering students in teaching activities, we developed the MAKER Ed Interns program in the summer of 2014. In this program, we developed a relationship with the Cambridge Friends School. They hosted engineering undergraduate students from Tufts designed and constructed a makerspace at their K-8 school, and then ran summer workshops for kids ages 5-15 in the space around various making and engineering activities. These included robotics work, designing digital instruments, making stop-motion animations, and doing other technical challenges that taught youth skills of engineering, computation, and design. MAKER Ed Interns were mentored by a teacher from the school, and they engaged in professional development workshops to discuss: issues of teaching, ways of assessing learning, considering relationships between school curriculum and makerspaces, and the de..."
