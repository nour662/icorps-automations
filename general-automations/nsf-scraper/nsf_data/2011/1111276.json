 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer networks, in particular the Internet, represent critical infrastructure for business, government, military, and personal communication. Several recent trends in technology and network use have pushed the capabilities required of the Internet beyond what can be provided by the currently deployed infrastructure. This project develops a new architectural design for the Internet of the near future that represents a transformative shift to enable sustained innovation in the core of the network, using economic principles. The core idea of this new network architecture is to support choice as the central aspect of the architecture. A network built on these principles will be able to adapt to emerging solutions for current and future challenges. The network architecture designed and prototyped in this work aims to (1) encourage alternatives to allow users to choose from a range of services, (2) let users vote with their wallet to reward superior and innovative services, (3) provide the mechanisms to stay informed on available alternatives and their performances. Solutions are approached from different directions, reflecting the team's multidisciplinary expertise in computer networking, network systems, management science, and network economics.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project contributes to enhancing the functionality and usability of the next-generation Internet, which is expected to become an important piece of infrastructure. The project also integrates research and education of graduate and undergraduate students at the participating organizations, where current efforts to integrate underrepresented minorities are continued. Results from this work are disseminated in the form of an open-source prototype and publications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe ChoiceNet project has been exploring ways in which economics can be integrated into the design of future internet architectures.  Historically, functionality has been added to the Internet by deploying new services at the edges of the network.  This has been a highly successful approach.  However, the heart of the network---the network layer that provides connectivity between end systems---has changed little over the years, limiting our ability to offer new services inside the network.  In other words, the current Internet architecture does not lend itself to improvements at the network layer.  One of the reasons is the lack of economic incentives for internet service providers to invent and deploy new services inside the network.\n \n To address this problem, the ChoiceNet project has been exploring ways for innovative providers to be compensated for deploying enhanced functionality inside the network.  To support this type of innovation, we designed and integrated an economy plane into the network architecture, which enables customers to compensate any internet service provider for offering new services---as opposed to the current Internet where customers pay their local internet service provider. We also developed a marketplace where providers can advertise (sell) their new services and customers can discover (shop for) services that meet their needs.\n \n When customers communicate with service providers, customers include some form of consideration (payment) to compensate providers for performing the service.  We showed that various types of consideration are possible depending on the customer-provider relationship. For example, we demonstrated a sender using a credit card number as the consideration to pay for the right to use a particular forwarding path across the internet.  We support credit card payments by integrating PayPal into the ChoiceNet economy plane and marketplace.  Having paid for use of a forwarding path, packets that flow across the path carry consideration in the form of a receipt (i.e., proof of purchase) that the forwarding service can quickly verify. In other cases the consideration may contain proof of group membership, where being a member of the group is sufficient payment for the provider to perform the service.  In cases where the service is offered for free, the consideration may be empty or be a value representing no payment.\n \n To demonstrate the utility of ChoiceNet, we designed and implemented (together with our ChoiceNet colleagues at the University of Kentucky, NC State University, and RENCI) a ChoiceNet prototype running on the GENI testbed.  Our prototype demonstrated the basic features of ChoiceNet through example services, including two new network layer packet forwarding services.  In one case, payment for the service was verified at the time the path was established.  In the other case, payment was verified at every hop along the path.  The prototype also supported a path selection service capable of finding suitable paths across the network.  Network providers could compete with one another, offering different paths at different price points.  To demonstrate competition, we created two different path selection services, each using a different algorithm to select the best set of paths so that customers could switch to (and pay for) a different path selection service if they are unhappy with the service they receive (i.e., vote with their wallet).\n\n \n\nWe also showed that centralized path computation services can be scaled to support Internet-sized topologies by pre-computing paths and pruning non-Pareto-optimal path choices right away. At connection setup time, a limited number of optimal choices are presented to the customer for selection. We also presented mechanisms that enable fast verification of traffic in the data plane to ensure that a valid economy plane contract is in place before providing service. We have developed several network economic models that consider price and ..."
