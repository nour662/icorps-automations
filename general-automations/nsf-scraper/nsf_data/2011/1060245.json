The program recruits transfer students from nearby Grand Rapids Community College. Scholarship students are selected based on a personal statement, letters of recommendation, a plan of study, and academic accomplishments. The program provides 30 scholarships per year. The disciplines supported are: biology, cell & molecular biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, geology, integrated science, information systems, mathematics, physics, and statistics. Students selected to participate in this program progress through the program as a cohort, both as a collective group and as smaller discipline-specific groups. Each student is matched with a faculty mentor who is an advocate throughout his or her academic career. Scholars are supported from admission through graduation.",
