The proposed program will send students from Southern University and Louisiana State University to China to conduct collaborative research with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Institute of Applied Ecology and Southern China Botanical Garden, and the Beijing Forestry Institute,  The research will be directed at four general topics: Modeling the impact of global warming and urbanization on natural resources; Combined effects of elevated levels of carbon dioxide and ozone on urban forests; Carbon storage and sequestration by urban forests; and Response of soil carbon dynamics to long-term nitrogen deposition in a tropical forest at the urban-rural interface. \r\n\r\nEach year four undergraduates and four graduate students will participate in the research activities in China. The project focuses on a very topical area of interest (i.e. sustainability), which has growing importance considering the world's current dependence on fossil fuels and the concomitant rise in greenhouse-gas levels. It involves a unique collaboration between the U.S. universities and the institutions in China. The substance of the research efforts should lead to better understanding of complex environmental dynamics in urban settings, which should have application in the U.S. and China as in other parts of the world and promote effective mitigation strategies. Also, the involvement of an HBCU in the IRES program should make a positive contribution to human-resource development in this field.",

The multidisciplinary and multi-institutional partnerships have resulted in a total of 33 students who have gained international research experiences at Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Institute for Applied Ecology (IAE), CAS Northeast Research Institute of Geography and Agro-Ecology (NERIGA), CAS China Forest Biodiversity Monitoring Network (CForBio), Beijing Forestry University, Gui Zhou University (GZU), Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University (NWAFU), and Shenyang Academy of Landscaping and Urban Forestry. The SU IRES project utilized the expertise of the Chinese senior scientists ranging from director of the CAS NERIGA, Vice President of GZU, to the research unit leaders at CAS IAE and CAS CForBio. Through the US-China faculty mentored research engagement, the SU IRES students&rsquo; research training and technical focus reflected the U.S.- China team&rsquo;s complementary strengths and mutual interests in three areas: 1. Impacts of climate change on natural resources, urban ecosystem responses, and coping strategies, 2. Climate change mitigation through urban forestry, and 3. GIS and remote sensing technology. The project provided opportunities for training and professional development through three phases: 1. Study in China pre-departure research, cultural, and workplace protocol training. 2. On-site in China research involvement, and 3. Post China trip research and result dissemination training.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To enhance scientific exchange, professional development, and professional network, we have organized students to participate in two US-China international symposia, one hosted in Baton Rouge, USA in 2012, the other in Shengyang, China. The symposia provided a platform for SU students to exchange research information with scientists and practitioners from China, USA, Australia, Czech Republic, and more. Through symposia participation, students gained knowledge in current and emerging issues, cutting edge research methodologies, and strategies and techniques in disseminating research results. The symposia also provided opportunities for students to meet and to interact with the top scientists in the field, and to develop professional network and collaboration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The SU IRES project enhanced students' capabilities in disseminating their international findings to peers and stakeholders so that people who do not travel to China can benefit from the project. The project helped to increase the number of publications and presentations. The project team of faculty and students have published 22 publications in journals, proceedings, and abstracts books, and presented a total of 23 papers at international, national and regional conferences/symposia.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The project enabled students and faculty to gain access to research projects, data and research technologies of our partners in Chinese institutions. After returned from China, SU students stated that their research skills were enhanced and their professional network were expanded. They felt more prepared and confident to enter an international research arena. The project provided excellent opportunities for SU students in acquiring the fundamental methodologies and hands - on experiences of executing a research agenda, learning technologies in ecosystem responses, climate change mitigation, and natural resource conservation, collecting data on various research topics, and applying ecological models. According to students&rsquo; post China trip reports, they believe that the experiential learning in China have enhanced their understating on climate change impacts. The students expressed that learn from the Chinese professionals who are extremely knowledgeable on forests and the science behind climate change and sustainability, access to some of the world&rsquo;s most high tech research equipment, ultimately puts them ahead of the game. They indicated that study in China enabled them to view Urban Forestry in a global perspective, and they are further convinced that opportunities extend far beyond USA. Students expressed that study in China is a life changing opportunity, made them excited about applying for research projects, without these opportunities, their matriculation and mindset would be completely different. They have been using their experiences to become a proponent for studies abroad.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through experiential learning and research participation, students have acquired the fundamental methodologies and hands-on experiences of executing a research agenda; and learned technologies in terrestrial ecosystems responses, climate change mitigation, and natural resource conservation.<strong> </strong>The broader impacts include 1. Enhanced student international experience and research skills that translate into application of learned knowledge and skills in their career; 2. Ensured that students work beyond the United States and bring lessons learned back home to their peers, stakeholders, and companies in hope of enhancing their competitiveness in the global market; 3. Strengthened international research partnerships and professional networks; 4. Enhanced application of foreign technologies in the United States; and 5. Strengthened the role that SU plays in enhancing the research competitiveness and workplace preparedness of the students from underrepresented groups. Being implemented at SU, the largest Historic Black University (HBCU) System in the United States, this project has made significant contributions in promoting the participation of underserved groups in STEM.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/11/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zhu&nbsp;H&nbsp;Ning</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1131281/1131281_10118638_1475694236478_IMG_5474--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1131281/1131281_10118638_1475694236478_IMG_5474--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2012 Student research experience in China\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1131281/1131281_10118638_1475694236478_IMG_5474--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2012 Student research experience in China\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Brittany Benjamin, Southern University student, participating in research at Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Institute for Applied Ecology (IAE).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Photo taken by Zhu Ning</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zhu&nbsp;H&nbsp;Ning</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2012 Student research experience in China</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1131281/1131281_10118638_1475694421308_IMG_3741--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1131281/1131281_10118638_1475694421308_IMG_3741--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"IMG 3741 2013 Student research experience in China\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1131281/1131281_10118638_1475694421308_IMG_3741--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 3741 2013 Student research experience in China\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Donovan Stone, Chris Smith, and Miesha Jefferson, Southern University students, at the research site while studying at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Northeast Research Institute of Geography and Agro-Ecology (NERIGA).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Photo taken by Zhu Ning</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zhu&nbsp;H&nbsp;Ning</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">IMG 3741 2013 Student research experience in China</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1131281/1131281_10118638_1475695097395_IMGCAS(2)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1131281/1131281_10118638_1475695097395_IMGCAS(2)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"IMG CAS2 2014 Student research experience in China\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1131281/1131281_10118638_1475695097395_IMGCAS(2)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"IMG CAS2 2014 Student research experience in China\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">S.P.
