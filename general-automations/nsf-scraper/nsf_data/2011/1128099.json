 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tunable Plasmonic Devices Enabled by Holographically-Formed Polymer Dispersed\r\nLiquid Crystals\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nObjective: The goal of this project is to address the challenge for the design and fabrication of\r\ntunable plasmonic devices through the electrical tuning of refractive index in holographicallyformed\r\npolymer dispersed liquid-crystals (H-PDLCs). Both tunable plasmonic nano-antennas\r\nand reconfigurable surface plasmon polariton (SPP) devices will be investigated using\r\ntransformation optics and cellular liquid crystals. The resulting tunable plasmonic devices will\r\nfeature fast tuning speed and flexible function for practical applications.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed tunable plasmonic devices rely on the H-PDLCs, which\r\nfeature electrical tuning capability and can be fabricated by the nano-fabrication technique. This\r\nis in contrast to the conventional plasmonic devices that are usually non-tunable, which has\r\nlimited their applications in optical systems. Moreover, the proposed uniform and gradient index\r\nH-PDLCs provide us with large flexibility in designing different tuning structures. Combining\r\nthese structures with device design techniques will lead to many new tunable plasmonic devices.\r\nBroader Impact: The successful design and fabrication of proposed H-PDLC based tunable\r\nplasmonic devices will have a large impact on future optical systems for uses in both civilian and\r\nmilitary sectors. Especially, they will find applications in the areas of sensing, imaging, energy\r\nharvesting, and communication systems. Other areas of impact include the following: (1)\r\nenhancement of optical devices research and education experiences for student researchers; (2)\r\nincreased participation of high school students, and underrepresented groups in science and\r\ntechnology; (3) rapid dissemination of research results through workshops, seminars, and\r\npublications.",
