 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose to analyze experimentally the processes of initiation, acceleration and self-healing of seismic slip at a patch on the surface of a fault. The experiments will be conducted on a new rotary shear apparatus that allows testing frictional sliding along rock blocks for large slip (a few meters), slip-velocity of ~1 m/s, and normal stress up to 30 MPa. Further, the design of this apparatus allows application of a finite amount of stored energy on a fault surface (up to 107 J/m2) for a short period of time (up to 5 s). Their preliminary results show that these conditions can generate an Earthquake-Like  lip Event (ELSE) along the rock sample with rise time <0.1 s, slip velocity up to 1 m/s, slip-distance up to 3 m, and self-healing (strength recovery and rupture arrest). They propose to use the unique capabilities of this apparatus for an extensive series of ELSE experiments that are analogous to earthquake processes at a fault patch under in-situ loading conditions. These experiments will allow analyzing fundamental earthquake parameters, such as rise-time, weakening, self-healing, slip velocity, slip distance, heat generation and energy dissipation under laboratory-controlled conditions.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project is to improve the apparatus capabilities in two main aspects:\r\n1. Stiffening of the loading frame to eliminate (or significantly reduce) the unstable shattering at\r\nhigh velocities.\r\n2. Develop and implement the torque control system that will allow us to simulate a wide range of\r\nearthquake scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\nA typical earthquake starts at a small nucleus and propagates as a fast moving\r\nrupture front along a fault surface. Every patch on the fault surface is at rest before the earthquake, it is\r\naccelerated to slip velocity of about 1 m/s by the rupture front and it stops slipping when the elastic\r\nenergy that was stored prior to the earthquake has been dissipated. Thus, the patch experiences abrupt\r\nacceleration and deceleration over periods from a fraction of a second to a few seconds. During this\r\nperiod of intense acceleration/deceleration, the patch friction changes dramatically without steady-state\r\nvelocity. On the other hand, typical experimental studies of fault friction are designed to determine the\r\nsteady-state friction that probably does not realized during earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research eliminates this fundamental experimental limitation by utilizing the unique\r\ncapabilities of an apparatus that was built recently in University of Oklahoma. The\r\napparatus is suitable to simulate earthquake-like events as it can load a laboratory rock patch by energy\r\nstored in a massive flywheel (225 kg). This unique, advanced design of the our experimental system\r\nallows simulating earthquake rupture processes under in-situ conditions of (1) high stress and high\r\nvelocity; (2) finite energy supply; and (3) stress and velocity control. The proposed experiments will\r\nprovide better links between experiments, theory and seismic concepts, and, by doing so, will\r\nsignificantly advance the understanding of earthquake rupture processes, earthquake energy balance,\r\nphysics of fault weakening, and the scaling of slip rates, slip magnitude, and radiated energy.",
