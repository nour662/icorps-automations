 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will support an international workshop on the mathematics at the\r\nintersection of convex geometry, topology, and combinatorics, or convex\r\ntopological combinatorics, for short. This is an important topic because\r\nconvex geometric and topological techniques have become a main tool in\r\ndiscrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. In fact, convex\r\ntopological combinatorics has had a impact in application areas such as\r\nalgorithm design, computer graphics, mathematical programming, solid\r\nmodeling, and computational biology. At the same time, topology and\r\ngeometry have benefited from the study of combinatorial structures such as\r\nconvex bodies, polyhedra, simplicial complexes, geometric graphs, etc.,\r\nbecause they appear naturally in relation to important algebraic and\r\ntopological spaces such as Grassmanians, toric varieties, configuration\r\nspaces, and others.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will be the first large international conference in\r\nNorth-America on the topic of convex topological combinatorics. The event\r\nintends to bring together top international researchers to discuss\r\ndevelopments in these intersecting fields. Besides specific mathematical\r\nresearch, the meeting will increase the cooperation between mathematical\r\nschools in the USA and Mexico, both of which have many strong researchers\r\nin convex topological combinatorics and a good number of Ph.D students\r\ndoing research in these topics. Both groups will benefit from the\r\ninteraction that the conference will bring.",
