 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award continues support for the University of California Species Stock\r\nCenter, a collection of living stocks of Drosophila species. The living\r\ncollection consists of over 1000 strains representing approximately 250\r\nspecies of the small insect commonly referred to as the fruit fly. Project goals\r\nare to provide live flies to researchers and educators at a charge that helps\r\ndefray operating costs. The whole genomes of 14 Drosophila species have\r\nbeen sequenced which has driven the use of these species by the biological\r\ncommunity including researchers in behavior, neurobiology, development,\r\ngenomics, ecology, physiology, immunology, and systems biology. Growth in\r\nthe collection includes addition of newly collected wild type strains and\r\naddition of transgenic strains for those species whose genomes have been\r\nsequenced.\r\n\r\nThese species provide unprecedented opportunities to study basic biological\r\nprocesses common to many species, including humans. In addition to\r\nenabling research, the Stock Center provides samples for educational uses in\r\nhigh schools, colleges and museums. The Stock Center also conducts an\r\nannual workshop for students and researchers wishing to learn more about\r\nthe varied species in the collection and to acquire the special knowledge\r\nneeded to work with them.",
