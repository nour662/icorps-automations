 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to computationally investigate i) how efficiency droop and color degradation in III-nitride solid-state lighting (SSL) devices are governed by an intricate interplay of crystal atomicity, built-in structural fields, and charge and phonon transport processes, and ii) how tuning the basic physical properties at nanoscale can create transformative solution paths. The multiscale numerical approach is built primarily upon i) a massively parallel molecular dynamics code for obtaining structural relaxation and phonon modes, ii) atomistic tight-binding models to calculate exciton and optical spectra, and iii) a quantum-corrected 3-D Monte Carlo transport solver. ab initio methods and available experimental data will be used for parameterization and model bandstructure calculations.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The research bridges the gap between continuum system and ab initio material modeling paradigms and will suggest design optimization routes by simulating realistically-sized devices containing >100 million atoms, which can subsequently be used by experimentalists to manufacture the device. The simulator will exploit computing capability and assess reliability of petascale clusters, use novel, memory-miserly, and fast algorithms, and incorporate state-of-the-art software design approaches.\r\nBroader Impact: SSL has the potential, by 2025, to decrease electricity consumed by lighting by >50%, cut ~28 million metric tons of carbon emission annually, and benefit general illumination, transportation, communication, automobiles, imaging, agriculture, and medicine. SSL will revolutionize semiconductor market and can reestablish U.S. manufacturing leadership. A free version of the simulator and tutorials will be deployed on nanoHUB.org. Findings of the research will be integrated into both undergraduate and graduate courses.",

To illustrate, solid-state lighting (SSL) devices, that mainly utilize semiconductor light-emitting diodes, show great promise to replace conventional light sources, with impressive economic and environmental benefits. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), it is estimated that, by 2035, switching to SSL could reduce national lighting electricity consumption by nearly 75%, the equivalent to 5.1 quadrillion BTUs, as well as spare the atmosphere 180 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. SSL devices could, theoretically, be over 90% efficient, vibration and shock resistant, have exceptionally long-life (over 50,000 hours), and offer a wide-range of tunability of the emission characteristics. SSL has the potential to revolutionize semiconductor market and reestablish U.S. manufacturing leadership.</p>\n<p>The overall conversion efficacy of SSL devices is given by a combination of <em>feeding</em>, <em>carrier injection</em>, <em>quantum</em>, and <em>optical </em>efficiencies. <em>Droop</em> in SSL devices is the loss of efficiency at high operating current density causing them to burn more energy per lumen. This is the <em>most pressing</em> problem in solid-state lighting technology today. It is known that, compared to conventional bulk and quantum well structures, nanostructured SSL devices offer several benefits such as: a) strain relaxation at the free surfaces; b) greater freedom in bandgap engineering; and c) stronger carrier con&shy;finement resulting in higher stability. However, experiments on emerging <em>nanoscale</em> SSL devices have been scarce (due mainly to complicated and expensive growth and characterization methods), which makes theoretical studies particularly demanding. To address these needs, in this project, we have: i) developed a multiscale-multiphysics simulator (using a coupled molecular mechanics/dynamics-atomistic tight binding-Monte Carlo transport framework) for modeling <em>nanoscale</em> (quantum dot and nanowire based) solid-state lighting devices with the capability of handling millions of atoms; ii) investigated how <em>droop</em> and degradation in SSL devices are governed by an intricate interplay of crystal atomicity, built-in structural fields, and charge and phonon transport processes at different length and time scales; and iii) explored new design space for boosting SSL efficiency. Listed below are some of the key outcomes of this project.</p>\n<p>1) An educational version of the <em>Nanoscale Solid-State Lighting Device Simulator</em> (<em>nanoSSL</em>) is published on NSF&rsquo;s nanoHUB.org on June 24, 2015. To date, this software has served 37 users across the globe.</p>\n<p>2) InN/GaN nanostructures exhibit atomically inhomo&shy;geneous and <em>long-range</em> internal electromechanical fields origi&shy;nating mainly from: a) the fundamental atomicity and interface discontinuity, b) epitaxial strain, c) piezoelectricity, and d) spontaneous (pyroelectric) polarization.</p>\n<p>3) The internal fields, magnitude of which can be several MV/cm, affect the electronic and optical properties of the devices significantly. First, such fields spatially separate the electrons and holes that leads to a reduction in the optical transition rate and an enhanced ra&shy;diative lifetime. Second, the en&shy;ergy of the optical transition may lie well below the <em>bulk</em> bandgap (so called quantum confined Stark effect). Third, in <em>thin</em> nanowires, in addition to the out-of-plane anisotropy, pronounced <em>in-plane</em> anisotropy was observed that arises from <em>quantization</em> of states and alteration of selection rules for optical transitions.</p>\n<p>4) <em>Nonlinear</em> (2<sup>nd</sup>-order) polarization tends to oppose the linear (1<sup>st</sup>-order) counterpart and renders a non-van&shy;ishing effect in retaining the symmetry of the system. Also, pyroelectric polarization is quite strong in GaN/AlN system and (in contrast to InN/GaN) the effects of piezo&shy;electric and pyroelectric fields <em>add up</em>.</p>\n<p>5) In nanostructures, the polarization coefficients exhibit a <em>strong size-dependence</em>. It is found that the first-principles inspired <em>diameter-dependent</em> polarization model results in a large piezoelectric potential that tends to <em>oppose</em> the pyroelectric counterpart leading to a much smaller net internal potential and improved efficiency and optical emission characteristics.</p>\n<p>6) Compared to the polar <em>c</em>-plane structures, the semi-polar <em>m</em>-plane and <em>a</em>-plane structures exhibit somewhat reduced internal fields. This, in effect, results in a higher <em>average</em> interband transition rate, a greater degree of isotropy, and higher conversion efficiency.</p>\n<p>7) Thermal conductivity in nanostructures is small compared to its bulk counter&shy;part. Study on thermal effect revealed a degradation in quantum efficiency on the order of ~7% for a 30K increase in the lattice temperature.</p>\n<p>8) Nitride nanostructures are potential candidate for single and entangled photon generation. As the size of the active region in these devices is reduced below 10 nm, quantum confinement significantly affects both the single-particle energy gap and the electron-hole Coulomb and exchange interactions. Both Coulomb and exchange interaction energies are found to be smaller in <em>m</em>-plane and <em>c-</em>plane structures.</p>\n<p>The project has produced 2 book chapters, 8 journal articles, 3 conference papers, 10 technical presentations, 1 online simulator, and several tutorials on high-performance computing. In total, 8 PhD (4 of whom already graduated), 2 MS, and 1 REU students have been involved (partially/fully) and trained in this project.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shaikh&nbsp;S&nbsp;Ahmed</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1102192/1102192_10111591_1477786865583_1_nanoSSL_simulator_on_nanoHUB--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1102192/1102192_10111591_1477786865583_1_nanoSSL_simulator_on_nanoHUB--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The nanoSSL Simulator on nanoHUB.org\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1102192/1102192_10111591_1477786865583_1_nanoSSL_simulator_on_nanoHUB--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The nanoSSL Simulator on nanoHUB.org\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The nanoSSL simulator on nanoHUB.org.
