 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a mobile distributed vehicular testbed equipped with sensory and communication devices for experimentation with emerging networking and application development challenges in the domain of vehicular participatory sensing. The project is motivated by the emergence of a new type of computing and social applications enabled by the proliferation of sensors of everyday use, such as GPS devices and car speedometers. These applications rely on self-selected communities of volunteers to perform data collection and sharing for purposes of mutual interest. Of particular interest to this project are applications that help reduce transportation energy cost and carbon footprint. For example, by sharing data on speed, fuel efficiency, and location of vehicles, better real-time navigation services can be developed that guide drivers to routes that are maximally fuel-efficient for their cars, hence reducing transportation carbon footprint. The testbed facilitates the investigation of several research challenges towards enabling such applications including the investigation of data privacy, energy-efficiency, disruption-tolerant communication, social networking, and management of interactive complexity. No common testbed is currently available that allows researchers to experiment with a live vehicular data collection system of non-trivial size for the purposes of investigating such challenges. By building such a testbed, this project helps usher in a new era of sensing applications with more integration of humans, networks, and the physical world, which may have a significant impact on the economy, energy, and the environment by reducing transportation energy cost and carbon footprint.",

The  project focused on supporting applications that help reduce  transportation energy cost and carbon footprint. The grant was used to outfit participating vehicles with sensors and radios to  enable research on energy-saving and environmental applications. The project was  conducted in collaboration with the University of Illinois Facilities  and Services (F&amp;S) Department and resulted in two different testbeds. The first testbed exploits part of the F&amp;S vehicle fleet for sensor   installation purposes in projects that do not have access to a   sufficient number of vehicles of their own. The primary asset offered by   this testbed is the ability to test vehicular network software on an   existing car fleet, as well as access to data (e.g., vehicle mobility)   traces collected from deployment. A second, portable multi-node \"rent-a-testbed\" was developed and kept on hand to support projects that use their own   vehicle fleets, such as vehicles of human subjects recruited for specific related studies. This rent-a-testbed allows researchers to outfit such vehicles with sensors and radios to support various vehicular   networking applications. Examples include (i) projects that  investigate  specific vehicular mobility, encounter, or parking patterns  not  exhibited by F&amp;S vehicles, as well as (ii) projects that  require  active driver participation (such as following specific routes  for  research purposes), which is not part of our agreement with  F&amp;S. Experiments on the above testbeds resulted in a better understanding of green navigation services, producing navigation software that offers energy-efficient routes for vehicles as opposed to the fastest or shortest routes. It was shown that up to 20% fuel savings could be achieved by following the green routes. The US transporation section today is responsible for about 30% of the total energy consumption in the nation. Reducing that by 20% would save an amount of energy that is three times larger than the total energy consumed by all data centers, or equivalently an amount comparable to the total consumption of the entire US aviation industry, which suggests a high potential for social, economic, and environmental impact. &nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<em></em></div><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/07/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Tarek&nbsp;F&nbsp;Abdelzaher</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
