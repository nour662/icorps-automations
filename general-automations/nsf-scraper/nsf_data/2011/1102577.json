The topics include fiscal and monetary policy, asset pricing, labor markets, consumptions and saving behavior, business investment, housing, wage and price setting, business cycles, long-run economic grown, the distribution of income and wealth, intermational capital flows and exchange rates, international trade and development, the macroeconomic implications of health costs, energy supply and demand, environmental issues, and the education system.\r\n\r\nThe papers presented develop empirical evidence, include real world institutions, and focus on relevance to policy.   A wide range of methodological approaches are included.  Papers are available online to the general public, and the series has been praised as a key forum for discussion of economic research and policy.",
