 "awd_abstract_narration": "Young, fast-growing forests can sequester huge amounts of carbon, but this potential is expected to be limited eventually by the nutrients required for biomass growth. Some forests are more productive than expected, given their age and available soil nutrients. In lowland Costa Rica, for example, experimental plantations were still highly productive and cycling large amounts of nitrogen after 22 years of growth. The broad aim of this research is to understand why these tropical forests remain productive. Specifically, this project will address the hypothesis that highly productive forests supply more carbon belowground to fine roots and soil microbes. Increased belowground allocation is expected to promote nutrient cycling largely through greater exploitation of soil resources by fine-root growth and microbial processes, which feed back to stimulate aboveground forest growth. A combination of large-scale and small-scale experimental approaches will be used to evaluate how carbon allocation to roots, symbiotic root microbes, and free-living soil microbes influence carbon and nitrogen cycling.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will provide an improved understanding of the belowground pathways underlying tropical forest biogeochemistry, thereby advancing our ability to model and predict the role of forests in current and future global carbon and nitrogen cycling. This new information will inform planning and development of potential mitigation strategies in response to increasing atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, the project will facilitate student mentoring, field based student education, and international collaboration. To increase participation by underrepresented groups, an inquiry-based special short course in Tropical Field Biology will be offered; undergraduate students will be identified and recruited by the Directors of NSF Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation Programs for Wisconsin and Illinois. The goal is to introduce these students to ecology and instill confidence and inspiration that will encourage them to apply for future research fellowships, and ultimately to graduate school.",

Nutrients are expected to become progressively more limiting for productivity however, and thus limit carbon sequestration. In previous studies in lowland Costa Rica however, experimental plantations were still highly productive and cycling large amounts of nitrogen after 22 years. The proposed mechanism was that highly productive forests supply more carbon belowground, especially to fine roots and soil micro-organisms. This would promote nutrient cycling which feeds back to stimulate aboveground forest growth. The goals of this project were to: 1) quantify and characterize the belowground partitioning of carbon to fine roots, soil fungi, and bacteria; and 2) determine the consequences for soil organic matter decay, nutrient uptake, and productivity. The experimental design contained six contrasting vegetation types, which allowed for evaluation of these mechanisms in forests that differ in cycling of carbon and nitrogen, but not in climatic and prior soil conditions. The four tree species grown in monodominant plantations had near zero biomass at the beginning of the experiment in 1988, but accumulated up to 1560, 540, 307, 53, 950, and 82 kg/ha of aluminum, calcium, magnesium, manganese, potassium, and&nbsp;phosphorus respectively in total biomass over the course of 25 years. Given that exchangeable nutrient concentrations are extremely low in this tropical soil, these rates of accrual of elements overturn the typical textbook stance that tropical soils that are low in nutrients cannot be remediated after deforestation. To the contrary, these data suggest that tropical trees are equipped with powerful mechanisms for mobilizing and taking up soil nutrients. Indeed, fine-root growth was highly correlated with the accumulation of&nbsp;soil-mineral-bound nutrients&nbsp;into the vegetation. There was evidence of pumping of nutrients from deeper depths, but the data also indicated that other mechanisms involving dynamics of organo-mineral complexes play an important role, especially given the enhanced cation uptake in the one aluminum-accumulating species.
