 "awd_abstract_narration": "The West Virginia State University (WVSU) Planning Grant for STEM Program Evaluation and Improvement is an 18-month, two phase planning process designed to 1) identify critical areas for improvement within the institution's undergraduate STEM programs and 2) develop an institutional plan for addressing those needs. The planning project represents the most comprehensive review of WVSU's STEM programs in recent years and presents an opportunity to develop a plan to transform the institution's offerings to better prepare students for work and further study in STEM fields. The evaluation phase of the project includes several data gathering activities designed to characterize student and faculty perception of program strengths and weaknesses, characterize program successes and challenges as demonstrated from historical student outcomes, identify previously unrecognized barriers to student retention and success, and compare current programs against benchmarks of success observed in STEM programs at other HBCUs. In addition, the evaluation phase includes an extensive review of regional STEM workforce needs that will inform the planning phase. A report on regional STEM workforce needs and a report on evidence-based approaches for improving STEM programs will be made available to HBCUs, other institutions, and the public.",
