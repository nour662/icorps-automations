 "awd_abstract_narration": "1132446\r\nHurt\r\nThis NSF award by the Environmental Health and Safety of Nanotechnology program supports work by Professors Robert Hurt and Agnes Kane to characterize the biological interactions of graphene-based nanomaterials. Most research in nanomaterial safety focuses on a select group of high-volume materials for which significant human and environmental exposures are possible.  Recently a new nanomaterial must be added to this list: graphene, the single-atom-thick sheet of graphite, which has attracted intense scientific and commercial interest since its discovery in 2004.  Graphene and related materials with small numbers of layers (few-layer graphene) and chemical modified surfaces (graphene oxide), are now being manufactured at increasing volumes to meet research and development needs for a wide range of applications in electronics, structural materials, chemical sensors, inks and papers.   \r\n\r\nIn this project a multidisciplinary team of engineers and toxicologists will investigate the interactions of graphene-family nanomaterials with biological molecules and with cells. A panel of commercial and developmental graphene-family materials has been assembled with variations in layer number (1 ? 30), lateral dimension (500 nm ? 25 um), and surface chemistry (pristine vs. graphene oxide) and will be thoroughly characterized for their relevant material properties as a first task.  A second task will use high-throughput media profiling techniques to determine if graphene-family nanomaterials with very high surface areas will deplete vitamins and amino acids, or will interfere with dye-based measurement techniques used in toxicity testing.  In a third task, the panel of graphene-family materials will be incubated with macrophages, a type of immune system cell that forms the first line of defense against microorganisms and foreign particulates inhaled into the lungs. These experiments will provide information on cell uptake, cell structure, oxidant production, cell viability, and production of inflammatory signaling agents as a function of mass does and surface area dose and using well-established, commercial, non-graphene, carbons as reference materials.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts -- This project will aid in risk assessment for graphene materials by providing data at doses relevant to occupational exposures.  The results will also provide an early screening of the potential of these materials to pose risks to diverse biological systems, both human and environmental. Comparisons across the graphene material family suggest rationale grouping of graphene-based nanomaterials into regulatory or risk categories and can suggest safe design strategies. Additional broader impacts will arise through the investigators? continued commitment to public engagement on the regulatory and societal issues surrounding nanosafety. Broader impacts on human resources for U.S. science will be made through the support of young female and Hispanic researchers in the project and the investigators? participation in summer enrichment programs with Rhode Island high-school science teachers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Title: \n\nCellular and Biomolecular Interactions with Graphene-Family Nanomaterials\n\n \n\nGraphene is new sheet-like material that is only one-atom thick.  Because of its unique properties it is being explored as a component in a wide of new technology concepts.  As scientists and developers learn make and use graphene in larger quantities, workers and consumers may be exposed to the material and it may also be released to the natural environment at the end of product life.   This project seeks to understand how this new ultrathin material, when produced and handled as a bulk powder, will interact with the human body and the natural environment upon release and exposure.  Being ultrathin, it may be possible to inhale the material into the deep lung, where its behavior is not currently well understood.\n\nThis project brought together a materials engineer and a biologist to study graphene behavior with cells, biological molecules and tissues.   The team first worked on methods to study graphene effect on cells in culture, and found that some of the standard biological tests do not work properly in the presence of this new material, which has a very high surface area and can capture and remove molecules needed to carry out the standard tests.  A scientific paper was published that describes how to avoid the artifacts that one may get when adding graphene into standard cell culture based test methods.  The project then studied how graphene sheets will behavior when they encounter the membrane that surrounds the cell and protects and isolates its contents.  We found that graphene sheets can spontaneously penetrate the cell membrane by inserting their atomically-thin corners or irregular edges into the membrane, leading to cell entry.  The ability to enter cells may lead to cell damage and toxicity in some situations, but is also useful for drug delivery applications and useful for the cells that take up and clear foreign objects from the lung.  The team also found that graphene can act as an antioxidant under some conditions, which may be useful in some of its applications.  Finally, another property of ultrathin sheet materials is their ability to fold and wrinkle.  The team discovered that graphene can be systematically wrinkled in a way that can usefully align cells on surfaces and manipulate their shapes, which may be of interest in tissue engineering applications.   Similar to folding is the process of crumpling, which can be used to form graphene shells around groups of other nanoparticles, to isolate those particles from the human body and possibly enable their safer use. Together, these findings were reported in seven different scientific journal articles.\n\n \n\nThis project has had broader impacts that extend beyond these basic science findings.   The principle investigators were engaged in outreach activities for health and environmental professionals that included workshop presentations for continuing education of occupational physicians and nurses interested in learning about nanotechnology, and presentations at government / industry workshops focused on nanotechnology policy, regulation, and commercialization.  One investigator served on a 2014 World Health Organization panel considering whether some natural minerals and carbon nanomaterials should be classified as possible or likely human carcinogens.      Another investigator led a team of carbon materials experts in the drafting of a new nomenclature for graphene-based materials that was published in 2013 and is now being used as a primary reference document for an official standard being developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO).  The project investigators also contributed to a chapter on nanotechnology in a standard reference work and textbook on toxicology that is widely used in graduate schools around the U.S. The project trained students at multiple levels (bachelors, masters, and PhD), who have graduated and taken positions in U.S. industr..."
