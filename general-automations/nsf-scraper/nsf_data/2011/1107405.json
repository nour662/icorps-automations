 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop non-destructive, or lossless, quantum state detection methods for single trapped neutral atoms in order to realize robust neutral atom qubits. This work will directly address an important limitation in neutral atom qubit experiments, which is that quantum state detection of single atoms results in the loss of the qubit from the trap. This research will lead to increases in experimental efficiency for neutral atom systems and enable exciting new developments in the field of quantum information.\r\n\r\nThis research will advance the broader field of quantum information science, which represents a new information paradigm at the cross-roads of information science and physics that may lead to revolutionary new computing technologies benefiting all of society.  Ultra-cold atoms and molecules provide one of the most promising experimental platforms for advancing the state of the art in quantum information science.  The results from this research may also impact other technologically important applications of cold atom research, including precision sensors for navigation and magnetometry, atomic clocks and emerging quantum technologies.",
