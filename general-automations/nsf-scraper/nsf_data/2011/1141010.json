 "awd_abstract_narration": "This joint program reviews the state-of-the-art of the field of model-based assistive robotic technologies for medicine and rehabilitation in the USA and Japan, outlines the fundamental science and technologies in this area, and proposes models for future collaborative research between Japan and USA by building on the mutual strengths. In particular, gait training for stroke patients using exoskeletons is studied.\r\n\r\nThe field of medical and rehabilitation robotics offers much in terms of broad societal impact.  In addition, the project exposes graduate students and faculty to the culture of research in Japan, and more broadly, Asia. Today, Japan leads in many areas of robotics and automation. The students in the NSF-JST program interact with researchers in Japan and visit prominent universities and research laboratories. This exposure provides excellent training for the students and prepares them for careers in industry and academia globally.",
