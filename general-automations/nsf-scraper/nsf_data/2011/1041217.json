Kirby\r\n\r\nThis award will provide funding for a conference \"Low-dimensional\r\nmanifolds and high-dimensional categories\". The title is somewhat\r\nironic, in that the low and high dimensions are in fact the same:\r\n3 and especially 4. The conference celebrates the occasion of\r\nMichael Freedman's 60th birthday and some of the current\r\nmathematical achievements and challenges influenced by Freedman's\r\nwork. For manifolds of dimension 5 and higher, there is a\r\nwell-established classification scheme, the so called surgery\r\ntheory which includes the celebrated s-cobordism theorem that\r\nproduces diffeomorphisms between manifolds from homotopy\r\ntheoretic data.  Dimensions below 5 are more difficult because\r\nthere is less room to maneuver and, as a consequence, the\r\ns-cobordism theorem fails.  For n-categories, dimensions n\r\ngreater than 2 are difficult because of the complexity of the\r\ncombinatorial relations which describe the various ways n-balls\r\ncan be cut, glued and rotated. Thus dimensions 3 and 4 represent\r\na shared frontier of the two subjects, though this frontier is\r\napproached from different directions. One of the main goals of\r\nthis conference is to promote cross-fertilization between experts\r\non 4-manifolds and experts on higher categories and quantum field\r\ntheories.\r\n\r\nMichael Freedman made groundbreaking contributions to the study\r\nand classification of 4-dimensional spaces (manifolds), which are\r\na central topic in the study of topology, and have connections\r\nwith algebra, geometry and physics.  Ideas from physics, in\r\nparticular quantum field theory, imply that there ought to be\r\ncertain constructions which describe the topology of\r\n4-dimensional spaces, that is, intrinsic properties which do not\r\ndepend on the measure of length or angles on the space.\r\nMathematically, these theories are formulated in the algebraic\r\nlanguage of category theory and require substantial new\r\ndevelopments in that area. The object of the conference is to\r\nbring together experts on 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds together\r\nwith experts in category theory and quantum field theory to\r\nexplore the interactions between these topics. Additional\r\ngeometric structures, such as broken Lefschetz fibrations,\r\ncontact and symplectic structures, smooth structures, and gauge\r\ntheories will also be explored at the conference.",
