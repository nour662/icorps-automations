 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) of the National Science Foundation, with additional support from the National Institutes of Health (National Institute of General Medical Sciences) supports Terri Taylor and colleagues at the American Chemical Society in their development of educational materials to teach members of the public about chemistry, and its ubiquity in everyday life.  The award activities will include engagement with the public at Science Festivals as well as through more formal interaction with teachers.  The work includes the development of Challenge Kits for distribution to upper elementary and middle schools, clubs, and other interested members of the general public.  The award coincides with the International Year of Chemistry.\r\n\r\nWork like that of Terri Taylor and her colleagues is aimed at introducing a broad cross-section of American society to this exciting area of research.  In addition, connecting young people with current areas of science enables the Foundation to more effectively encourage young people to pursue careers in the science and technology sectors.",
