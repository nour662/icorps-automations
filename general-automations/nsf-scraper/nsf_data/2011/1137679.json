 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to the 11th International workshop on the Interrelationship between Plasma Experiments in the Laboratory and in Space (IPELS), to be held at Whistler, British Columbia, Canada on July 10 to 15, 2011. The IPELS Workshop is a leading international meeting that began in 1991, and in the past 20 years the research topics covered at the meeting have expanded to include almost all plasma phenomena common in space and laboratory. At the heart of the workshop is the close interaction and cross-fertilization between international working groups from laboratory, space and astrophysics that occurs at the meetings. The Workshop has been held alternately in Europe and the US every two years for most of its history. However, the last three workshops were held either in Europe (Tromso, Norway in 2005 and Djuronaset, Sweden in 2009) or in Australia (Palm Cove in 2007). The 2011 meeting will mark the first return of the meeting to North America since 2003, eight years ago. The award will provide support for defraying travel and conference expenses for (1) U.S. students and young researchers with priorities for women and minorities and (2) attendees from developing countries.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of topics to be covered: Collisionless shock and particle acceleration; Magnetic dynamo and angular momentum transport; Reconnection and explosive phenomena; Plasma waves and wave-particle interactions; Instabilities and turbulence; Physics of dusty plasmas and sheaths; Jets and winds.\r\n\r\nThe workshop organizers are Hantao Ji of PPPL, Tai Phan of UC Berkeley, and Ellen Zweibel of U.\r\nWisconsin Madison.",
