 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Texas at Austin (UT-A) is planning to join the existing multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled \"The Wireless Internet Center for Advanced Technology\" (WICAT) which is currently comprised of four member institutions: the Polytechnic Institute of NYU as the lead institution, Auburn University, the University of Virginia, and Virginia Tech. \r\n\r\nThe UT-A WICAT site will focus on massively broadband wireless RF Integrated circuits and signal processing. This includes the theory and practice of on-chip antennas, receiver and transmitter design and scalable signal and system approaches. The UT-A Site will bring capability in new communication circuits, system architectures, and antenna and propagation knowledge for 60 GHz and above needed for emerging generations of wireless systems. \r\n\r\nA new site of WICAT at UT-A will enable chip and circuit and signal processing co-design capability in a new frequency range enabling research insights at both the physical and functional network levels. There is good integration of outreach and diversity with site plans drawing on existing university programs and leveraging research of the site.",
