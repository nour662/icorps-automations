 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nCrocodylia (alligators, gharials, and crocodiles) is one of the major extant reptilian groups.  As such, a basic grasp of the structure and function of crocodilian genomes is essential to developing a comprehensive understanding of genome evolution, structure, and function in amniotes.  Furthermore, because they are the closest living relatives of birds, their genomes represent the best group through which investigators can gain an outside perspective on avian genome evolution and function.  The aim of this project is to advance understanding of crocodilian genomes and gain insight into the evolution of nodal amniote lineages by producing a draft genome sequence for the Indian gharial (Gavialis gangeticus; Family Gavialidae). This single aim is one component of a larger coordinated effort by the International Crocodilian Genomes Working Group (ICGWG) to generate draft genome sequences for three representative crocodilians.  The information generated by the combined projects will expand opportunities for understanding the evolution of amniotes, especially reptiles and birds, fill a large gap in our sample of vertebrate genome space, and provide resources for researchers interested in amniote biology across the globe.  The overall project will generate substantial genomic resources for representatives of all three extant lineages of an entire Order.  As the project concerns charismatic megafauna of great interest to the general public, the project has the potential to be very high profile.  More importantly, this rare opportunity to build critical resources for all extant lineages of an ancient (200+ my) and important vertebrate Order occupying a critical position in amniote phylogeny has substantial scientific merit.  The project will allow Dr. Ray and other researchers to generate hypotheses and to develop and answer questions important to understanding of the evolution of genome structure and function of not only crocodilians, but also of other amniotes including birds, mammals and other reptiles.\r\n  \r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe research will serve as a focal point for local high school teachers to experience current research in molecular biology and evolution through integration into a functional research laboratory.  The teachers will then be aided in incorporating the knowledge and experiences gained into their teaching practices for the benefit of their students.  Furthermore, the data will be shared by all members of the ICGWG, all of whom are educators at their respective institutions.  The data from this and the other two genomes will be the basis for educational materials introduced into high school and undergraduate classes by the various PIs.  In addition, the ICGWG has developed a plan to share all analyses of the data with the public through a links to the popular Crocodilia.com website that is run by Kent Vliet of the Crocodilian Advisory Group.  These efforts will inform general aspects of evolution and genomics and highlight crocodilians, organisms of broad public interest.  Public understanding of evolution and genome biology will be enhanced through the use of these charismatic megafauna.",

However, the effect of these funds did not end there.  Given that this was part of a larger project with participants in six countries, the data have been used extensively.  For example,  Amanda Chong is a graduate student in Sydney Australia.
