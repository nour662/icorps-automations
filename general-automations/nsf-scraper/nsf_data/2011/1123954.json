Although many of the research advances made by the research investigators funded by NSF's CNS Division have been critical to the success of cloud computing, the intent of this event was to help NSF and other funding agencies to develop a coherent vision of cloud computing from a scientific perspective. \n\n\nWith this goal in mind, funding was requested and approved to organize a workshop style meeting of approximately 50-60 NSF principal investigators to develop a coherent research vision and agenda for the future research in cloud computing.\n\n\nActivities &amp; Outcomes\n\n\n1.
