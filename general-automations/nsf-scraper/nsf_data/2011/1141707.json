The final phase envisioned but not funded by this proposal request would be the creation of complex economic and social models for the future long-term sustainability of Alaska Native and rural communities in Alaska.",

This is the Think Tank phase (Phase I) of a three phase project aimed at helping Alaskansunderstand the implications of a post-oil economy in the state and its impact on Alaska Native villages and people.\n\nTo date, one of two sessions for the think tank has been hosted.  Fourteen emerging and renowned leaders, economists, students, FAI Board of Trustee members and staff participated  An interactive dialogue process was used to engage each participant as a resource to the\ndiscussion and a graphic harvester visually captured group sessions to create\nan immediate map of topics that is being used to formulate the second session\nand inform the final report.  Dialogue topics included what a post-oil economy in Alaska would and could look like, including the affects, impact, and assessment of declining oil revenue, current community understanding and knowledge building needs, and most importantly, the need for Native community and leadership to be involved now in discussing the larger\nconsequences and opportunities of the sustainability question.\n\n\nThe questions posed and discussed during the\nfirst think tank session were:\n\nIn a \u00e6post-oil economy\u00c6, what impacts\ncan we anticipate on Alaska Native communities?  \nWhat knowledge do Alaska Natives have\nto help Alaska prepare for a new phase of its societal development?\nWhat information do policy makers need\nto help prepare Alaska for this new phase?\nWhat are the negatives and positives\nof what may arise for Alaska due to decreased oil production?\nIn moving from this think tank into\nthe next stage of the project, what should we make sure not to forget to address?\n\n\nThe think tank sessions serve as the starting point and provide a foundation to build Phase II of the project,\"Strengthening the Sustainability of Alaska Native Communities in a Post-OilEconomy Summit.\"   When asked about moving to the next phase - the Summit - the sentimentshared was: \"We need to harness these emotions to try to create atransformative structure where anything and everything that\u00c6s valuable is atthe table with Native Leadership involved.
