Collier (The New School) and Andrew Lakoff (University of Southern California)\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nIn the last two decades a series of events in the United States has focused public attention on the government?s role in anticipating and managing catastrophic events. In the wake of terrorist attacks, major natural disasters, pandemic influenza, and financial crises, planners and policy-makers have been criticized for their failure to prepare adequately for potential catastrophes. The problem of catastrophic risk has become a critical arena in which government is expected to manage risks to collective wellbeing.  This project approaches the government of catastrophic risk from the vantage of science and technology studies: it asks how the category of catastrophic risk is constituted as an object of knowledge and intervention at the interface of potentially disruptive events, on the one hand, and the agencies and experts charged with managing them, on the other. \r\n\r\nThe project investigates the historical emergence of distinctive ?styles of reasoning? about catastrophic risk, and associated knowledge practices such as catastrophe modeling, vulnerability assessment, and simulation exercises. Many of these practices were initially developed in the context of the Cold War military confrontation, and then migrated to other areas, including natural disaster response, public health, and terrorism preparedness. The project traces critical moments when experts developed tools to manage events whose catastrophic potential outstripped the capacities of government agencies charged with protecting wellbeing. \r\n\r\nFindings from the investigation will be significant for several areas of scholarship and policy. These findings indicate that contemporary controversies over risk governance can be understood in terms of conflicting styles of reasoning that cannot be adjudicated by reference to common standards for validating truths. For policy-makers and risk analysts, the project?s findings will be of interest in that they shed new light on the sources of conflict among experts and officials over how to understand and mitigate the risk of potentially catastrophic events.",

In the wake of terrorist attacks, major natural disasters, pandemic influenza, and financial crises, planners and policy-makers have been criticized for their failure to prepare adequately for potential catastrophes. They face intense pressure to improve preparedness, to reduce vulnerabilities, and to increase response capacity. The problem of emergency has thus become a critical arena in which government is expected to manage risks to collective wellbeing. Our project on \"Technocratic Expertise and the Politics of Emergency\" examined how expert communities have shaped understandings of emergencies, and the political contexts in which they have worked. \nNSF funds were used to support a number of activities that were critical to this project, including:\n\n \n\nArchival research in the National Archives and Records Administration\nArchival research at the Air Force Historical Research Agency\n\nCollaborative work among the co-PIs and with MA and PhD students at Columbia University, The New School, and the University of Southern California\nOrganization of a collaborative issue of a scholarly magazine on \"systemic risk\"\nResearch in secondary sources on specific topics that were relevant to the project, including New Deal economics, strategic bombing theory, and Cold War non-military preparedness\n\n\n\n \nThis research traced current institutions for governing emergencies in the United States to the Cold War. Over the course of the decades following World War II, experts in think tanks and government agencies shaped the knowledge practices and institutional mechanisms of a \"political technology of emergency.\" We examined how these tools were then extended to non-military emergencies such as natural disasters in the 1960s and the 1970s and, more recently, to the development of \"critical infrastructure protection\" in response to the threat of terrorism or technological accidents, and the rise of \"public health preparedness\" as a response to the specter of catastrophic infectious disease. \nThe project has resulted in a number of publications that are either in preparation, in production, or already published. Among these are:\n\n \n\nThe Government of Emergency (with co-PI Andrew Lakoff) &ndash; a major academic press publication, currently in preparation.\n\"Neoliberalism and Natural Disaster\" &ndash; an article submitted for review at the Journal of Cultural Economy.\n\"Vital Systems Security\" (with co-PI Andrew Lakoff) &ndash; an article accepted for publication in Theory, Culture, and Society\n\"Limn 1: Systemic Risk,\" an issue of the scholarly magazine Limn devoted to \"systemic risk\" &ndash; a concept that has recently become central to many domains of emergency management, including finance and Critical Infrastructure Protection (http://limn.it/issue/01/). The co-PIs contributed an article titled \"System Vulnerability and the Problem of National Survival.\"\n\nResults from the project have also been presented at at numerous universities in the United States and in other countries, including the University of California, San Diego; The New School; Durham University (U.K.); the University of Helsinki; the Goethe University of Frankfurt; and the University of Hamburg.\n\n \nTNSCollier13\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/04/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen J Collier"
