 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided to examine the impact of sea ice on the distribution and abundance of zooplankton, and how they are partitioned among top predators. To this end, new and historical data will be used to test a series of hypotheses and answer questions relating to bottom-up and top-down control of large crustacean zooplankton and their impact on the flow of carbon and energy in the ecosystem. From the examination of these hypotheses, new mechanisms will be derived and old ones re-evaluated. Existing numerical models will be used to assess the relative importance of these mechanisms. Existing conceptual models will be tested, and new conceptual models of carbon and energy flow will be developed. Such a study of the eastern Bering Sea shelf ecosystem is timely. Some of the most direct effects of changing climate will be on sea-ice - its extent, duration, timing of retreat, and inter-annual variability. Sea ice in turn controls ocean temperature/salinity, timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom and thus the extent of export/remineralization of fixed carbon. Crustacean zooplankton can be a choke-point in the flow of carbon and energy through the food chain.\r\n\r\nThe Bering Sea ecosystem provides roughly half the commercial seafood landings in the United States, as well as significant resources for subsistence fishermen.  Major fluctuations in these stocks have occurred in the past and been associated with climate variations.  Improved management of these important fisheries should be enabled by the understanding derived from this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Bering Sea and other sub-Arctic and Arctic seas are predicted to be among those regions most severely affected by global warming, as relatively small changes in the heat content of the water can have a disproportionately large effect on the presence of seasonal sea ice.  Over the last decade, a wealth of data has become available for the eastern Bering Sea from continued monitoring and multiple large-scale, comprehensive research programs. From these efforts, it is becoming increasingly evident that the presence or absence of sea-ice in spring is perhaps the single most important component determining the physical and biological structure of this critically important ecosystem, not only in spring, but for the remainder of the warm season.  The Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) project, was designed to not only build upon previous research, but also to expand the research effort up to and including the human dimension. \n\nThe Bering Sea shelf ecosystem is one of the most productive, in terms of fisheries yield, in the world.  These high levels of fisheries production are supported by even higher levels of productivity at lower trophic levels, namely the zooplankton (animal plankton) that are fed upon by fish, and the phytoplankton (plant plankton) that are fed upon by the zooplankton.  Our specific component of the BEST project focused on how the presence or absence of spring sea ice impacted both the total productivity by phytoplankton as well as the phytoplankton assemblage composition.  In addition, our project focused on how changes in phytoplankton productivity and composition may alter the fate of that productivity between the water column fisheries (e.g., Pollock) and bottom dwelling fisheries (e.g., king crab).\n\nWe observed that as water temperatures increased, there was in general, a decrease in the total amount of phytoplankton present and that their productivity decreased as well.  In addition, as water temperatures increased there was a substantial shift in phytoplankton assemblage composition from larger phytoplankton cells, such as diatoms, to smaller, flagellated phytoplankton.  This shift in cell size was also associated with a decrease in the fraction of phytoplankton productivity that was channeled to the bottom-dwelling communities.  These observed changes in phytoplankton productivity, abundance and composition that co-vary with increasing water temperatures are very similar to results observed in temperate latitude systems throughout the northern hemisphere.  These coordinated changes in phytoplankton will likely shunt a larger proportion production and energy to smaller zooplankton, resulting in potentially lower overall fisheries harvests as energy entering the system via phytoplankton takes a more circuitous path to higher trophic levels and more energy is lost to respiration.  \n\nIn addition to the flow of particulate matter from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels, our data show that as water temperatures increase, a larger fraction of phytoplankton production also is entering the dissolved organic carbon pool.  Detrimental to the highly productive fisheries, the release of dissolved organic carbon likely represents a \u00e6dead end\u00c6 for the flow of carbon and energy through the ecosystem.  These changes in phytoplankton productivity and its fate, linked to increasing temperature, will undoubtedly be associated with reductions in carbon and energy available to higher trophic level fisheries. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward G Durbin"
