 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Hierarchical Manufacturing (CHM) is a leading research and education center for the development of precision and cost efficient process platforms and tools for the manufacturing of next generation, nanotechnology-enabled devices for electronics, energy conversion, resource conservation and human health.  The Center's approach involves the integration of components and systems across multiple length scales using novel nanofabrication processes for sub-30 nm elements based on directed self-assembly, additive-driven assembly, nanoimprint lithography, and conformal deposition at the nanoscale in combination with either Si wafer-based technologies or high-rate roll-to-roll based production tools.  The CHM effort is made comprehensive by research on device design, modeling and prototype testing in functional architectures that take advantage of the specific hierarchical nanomanufacturing capabilities developed by the Center.  The research structure consists of three Technical Research Groups (TRGs) and system-level test beds in which the key science, engineering and process barriers to the manufacturing of device nanostructures using the CHM platform tools are identified, systematically addressed and resolved. TRG 1, Nanoscale Materials and Processes, addresses the materials systems and processes necessary for high reliability nanofabrication and supports fundamental research on the CHM's core technologies. TRG 2, Nanoscale Devices, Systems, and Metrology, supports fundamental studies in magnetics, photonics and device design to generate proof-of-concept prototypes that can be assembled using advances from TRG 1 and the CHM's process platforms. TRG 3, Sensors and Environmental Monitoring, is creating new systems for on-chip separations, diagnostics and environmental monitoring. This includes new strategies for tracking nanomaterials in the environment and assessing their toxicity and biodistribution in plant and animal species. The test beds are the heart of process and platform development where promising concepts transition from laboratory results into reliable, rapid, high-yield and transferable methodologies.  CHM test beds include a unique a roll-to-roll process facility for self-assembled materials and devices, including custom coating lines for nanohybrid materials and roll-to-roll nanoimprint tools. Test bed demonstration projects include polymer batteries, flexible photovoltaics and nanoporous films for separations.  The CHM's fundamental science and test bed efforts incorporate faculty and research professionals at UMass Amherst, Binghamton University, MIT, The University of Michigan, Mount Holyoke College, NIST, The University of Puerto Rico, and Rice University and benefit from collaborations with leading groups in Europe and Asia.\r\n \r\nIn terms of broader impacts, the implementation of efficient nanomanufacturing strategies that are compatible with Si wafer processing or high-volume roll-to-roll processing will enable the production of high performance computing, memory, sensing and photonic/optically active media and devices as well as nano-enabled products in energy conversion, organic electronics and displays at acceptable cost.  Such advances will help to transform our nation?s substantial investment in basic research into products that provide substantial social and economic benefits.  In addition, the CHM is the administrative hub of the National Nanomanufacturing Network (NNN).  The NNN is a catalyst for U.S. nanomanufacturing-based economic development and research collaboration.  It comprises a network of manufacturing facilities and expertise, a dynamic web-based information resource, and a pathway for university-industry-government partnerships.  The NNN efforts include InterNano, a freely accessible digital library and information resource on nanomanufacturing.  The NNN coordinates, hosts and distributes the outcome of workshops on emerging areas in nanotechnology research, implementation and societal implications.  The CHM further serves a broad educational audience, including those in K-12, community college, undergraduate and graduate schools, and the public.  The CHM's strategy focuses on training K-12 teachers in nanoscience curriculum, developing re-purposeable educational materials for various audiences and levels, piloting and disseminating nanomanufacturing and nanoscience educational content to community colleges, and enhancing undergraduate and graduate training in nanotechnology. The CHM champions the principle of diverse participation in all of its activities: research, education, outreach and management.  A Diversity Team coordinates CHM-wide team efforts to ensure efficient implementation of the Center?s Diversity Strategic Plan.",
