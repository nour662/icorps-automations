 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical:\r\n\r\nNanoparticle magnetism is a subject of much fundamental and technological interest, with many unresolved questions about the nature of intraparticle and interparticle interactions.  This project will probe these issues through novel polarized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments of magnetic oxide nanoparticles.  The nanoparticles will be synthesized using solution chemistry methods that have sensitive control of particle size, separation, and composition.  The PI and her undergraduate students will use polarized SANS and related methods to determine core and shell spin arrangements, interparticle magnetic correlation lengths, and connections between these and the more macroscopic behavior evident in applications.  The work will yield quantitative data on nanoparticle structures, information difficult to obtain through other approaches.  A broader impact of this research centers on its emphasis on helping develop advanced techniques, particularly significant given recent improvements in US neutron scattering facilities.  This award will support research at an undergraduate institution and as such, will lead to the training of undergraduate students in these important methods.\r\n\r\nNon-technical:\r\n\r\nMagnetic nanoparticles are tiny magnets which can be used for computer data storage, targeted drug delivery, and a host of other applications.  For these different uses, it is important to characterize the way in which the individual magnetic components align and interact.  This award will support the study of magnetic oxide nanoparticles using advanced neutron scattering techniques that the PI and her undergraduate students are helping to develop in collaboration with researchers at the NIST Center for Neutron Research.  The nanoparticles will be synthesized using solution chemistry methods that allow for sensitive control of particle size, separation, and composition.  The samples will be investigated with polarized small-angle neutron scattering to yield quantitative data on nanoparticle structures that are difficult to obtain through other methods.  A broader impact of this research involves its emphasis on helping develop advanced techniques, particularly significant given recent improvements in US neutron scattering facilities.  In addition, this award will support research at an undergraduate institution and as such, will lead to the training of undergraduate students in these important methods.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMagnetic nanoparticles are tiny magnets which can be used for computer data storage, targeted drug delivery, and a host of other applications.  For these different uses, it is important to characterize the way in which the individual magnetic components align and interact, but it is often difficult to find out this information from standard measurement approaches. \n\nIn this project, we used advanced neutron scattering techniques in collaboration with researchers at the NIST Center for Neutron Research and from Carnegie Mellon University in order to determine the magnetic structure of a series of different oxide nanoparticles.  We found that for magnetite (Fe3O4), the nanoparticles adopt an unusual arrangement in which the moments in the center of the particle line up with an applied magnet direction, but an outer shell points at an angle (Fig. 1).  The size of the core and shell depends on temperature and applied magnetic field.  For cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4), the entire nanoparticle has the same structure but tilts in an applied magnetic field, with the tilting varying from nanoparticle to nanoparticle (Fig. 2).  In manganese ferrite (MnFe2O4), an unusual coupling from one nanoparticle to another has been observed.  These observations provide new insights into the range of possible magnetic structures that are present in magnetic nanoparticle systems, thereby affecting their use in different applications.  The data provide benchmarks for theoretical efforts to predict the magnetic structure of other nanoparticles.  In collaboration with researchers at the Cleveland Clinic and at Case Western Reserve University, we have also developed a new device to assist in purifying magnetic nanoparticles with variable magnetic moments.\n\nBesides these technical accomplishments and the work in promoting novel measurement techniques, this project has made significant contributions from an educational standpoint.  Ten different undergraduate students have been associated with this award. For seven, this research represented their first research lab experience.  Three are co-authors on peer-reviewed journal articles associated with this project, and all five of the now graduated students are pursuing STEM-related careers with two in Ph.D. materials science graduate programs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yumi Ijiri"
