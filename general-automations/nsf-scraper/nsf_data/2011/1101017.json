 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the heart of algebraic combinatorics is the philosophy that every aspect of mathematics can be made more precise, more concrete and more computationally feasible by identifying key combinatorial structures.  This proposal addresses several specific problems that span a wide range of mathematics including topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory, statistics, computer science and combinatorics.  The central theme is to facilitate computation and understanding in these areas.  The four areas of research include varieties with combinatorial structures, k-Schur functions, branched polymers, and combinatorial/statistical algorithms for analyzing ordered data.\r\n\r\nThe work proposed will have a broad impact in several areas of pure math, theoretical physics, computer science and statistics.  All of the proposed work will have a computational focus which will further develop algorithms and proof techniques.  All of the proposed work will have a human impact component through teaching and mentoring of undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs doing research.  In terms of education, the PI has initiated a service learning course to address problems in non-profit organizations and small businesses in our community through mathematics.",

Progress was made on characterizing  rational smoothness in affine Schubert varieties and generalized  Richardson varieties.  Dual equivalence was extended both to the  affine permutations and to signed permutations.  Enumerative  formulas were given for permutations with a given peak set, and  these results were used to study new probabilistic processes and given  theorems on convergence.  Enumerative formulas for tanglegrams were  given connecting combinatorics with computational biology.  Several  long standing open problems related to conjectures of Macdonald,  Stanley, Fomin and Kirilov were answered positively.  Some of these  conjectures had been open for approximately 25 years.  Finally, a  general enumerative approach to studying parabolic double cosets of  Coxeter groups was studied.\n\n\n  Nineteen papers were co-written by the PI and collaborators.  These  have all been posted on the arXiv and all are either published or  submitted at this time.  In addition, this grant supported 7  Ph.D. students and 2 master's students through a portion of their  research.  They have submitted and/or published nine additional  papers on which the PI was mentor but not a coauthor.\n\n  Over the period of the grant, the PI was research advisor to 8  Ph.d. students and 3 master's students.
