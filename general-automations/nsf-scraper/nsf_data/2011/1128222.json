 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to engineer nanostructures to control the thermal properties of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. Specific objectives are: engineer the electro-thermal response of the detectors to improve the speed of these devices; and, model the microscopic mechanism of photodetection to shed light on the physical origin of the detector jitter and minimize it. To achieve the first objective, an improved electro-thermal model of the superconducting nanowire will be developed. Nanostructures will be designed to directly control the thermal behaviour of the nanowires at the nanoscale, which will in turn allow validating the predictions the theoretical model. Achieving the second objective will require the development of a detailed model of the excitation and expansion of the hot-spot. \r\nThe intellectual merit of this program is to advance the speed and timing precision of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors by first clarifying their fundamental physics of operation, and then engineering a new device architecture based on this understanding. \r\nThe broader impacts of this program are: (1) the introduction of a new generation of diverse undergraduate and graduate students to the fields of superconductivity, thermal processes in condensed matter, and nano- and quantum-optics; (2) the integration of the scientific results as case studies into the curriculum of two courses (one for graduate students and advanced undergraduates, and another targeted at post-graduate professionals), which focus on the practical role of nanofabrication in advanced research; and (3) the development of technological applications in industrial and scientific areas ranging from communications to astrophysical observations.",

Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors beat the competition in all of these areas, detecting photons more efficiently, faster, with fewer false positives.

It made a lot of assumptions, but we were able to make some predictions about how to make sure the devices would always be able to reset themselves to be ready to detect again after firing. However, the model did not allow us to take into account many important effects, such as the geometry of the device. Additionally it made a lot of simplifying assumptions. We needed to expand it to try to incorporate more phenomenon so that we could try to tackle some of the remaining questions about these detectors. Our NSF funding allowed us to create and test a more complex model that allows us to predict the behavior of superconducting nanostructures with complex geometries. It also includes some of the subtle issues related to whether the heating goes into moving electrons or sound waves in the material..\n\n \nOur improved simulation can run on a desktop computer and allowed us predict how our detectors respond to various influences that can suppress superconductivity in our nanocircuits. In particular, modeling the heating in the detection event lead to a better understanding of how localized heating could suppress superconductivity in larger sections. Our improved understanding of local heating\u00c6s effect allowed us to predict and then create a new superconducting three terminal device, which functions similarly to a transistor but is capable of operation at cryogenic temperatures. We\u00c6ve used this new device to implement a variety of superconducting circuits, similar to many circuits that are implemented with standard semiconductors but with the promise of combining speed and lower power dissipation. Our simulation is also helping us improve standard SNSPDs, and further explore how they ..."
