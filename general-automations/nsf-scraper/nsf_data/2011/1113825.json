 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop an Aromatic Thermosetting Copolyester (ATSP) system and process it into highly-effective wear resistant coatings. Surface treatments and coatings are key to improving wear performance and durability in a wide array of applications. In this project, different ATSP powder blends will be studied.  Coatings of ATSP/PTFE blends on metal substrates (using sintering) will be produced.  Tribological tests of these coatings under industrially-relevant conditions will be performed.  Preliminary spray coatings from the ATSP powder blends will also be explored. \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide ultra-low wear coatings for mechanical devices, such as air-conditioning and refrigeration compressors, to replace the liquid lubricants. Recent preliminary research on air-conditioning and refrigeration compressor surfaces has shown that high-performance and recyclable ATSP system exhibit low friction coefficient and at least one order of magnitude reduction in wear rate compared to the state-of-art polymeric coatings. Blends of ATSP with other polymers and additives have the potential to offer low-cost and versatile wear resistant coatings for applications in engines, pumps and compressors.",

The problems associated with use of liquid lubricants, hard/soft coatings are well known but only modest progress has been achieved partly due to lack of research on new material systems. ATSP Innovations, with team partners the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and the State University of New York at Stony Brook, produced and tested highly effective wear resistant coatings by blending ATSP with Teflon&reg; and other tribologically beneficial additives in the Phase I program.  The main advantages of these polymeric-based coatings are their relatively low cost and simple substrate surface conditioning (i.e., no need for expensive surface preparation before coating).  Key features are:\n\n1) Thermally stable at temperatures required to process Teflon&reg; (350-450&deg;C).\n\n2) Selected compositions (e.g., 5% Teflon&reg; blended with ATSP) exhibited excellent tribological properties with several samples evidencing \"zero\" wear and low friction coefficient values (COF) that remained stable during testing.  Both are important attributes for a long-term wear coating.\n\n3) The ability to undergo interchain transesterification reactions at temperatures in excess of 325&deg;C permitting reincorporation of wear debris into the wear coating.\n\n4) Good adhesion of ATSP to metals such as stainless steel and cast iron.\n\nATSP coatings produced in Phase I were shown to perform similar or better than industrially optimized state-of-the-art polymeric-based coatings.  Preliminary thermal spray coatings of neat ATSP were prepared at Stony Brook using multiple parameters and initial results are promising for this industrial relevant process.\n\nBroader Impacts/Commercial Potential\n\nDevelopment of the recently discovered ATSP family heralds a major advance for the field of wear and lubrication.
