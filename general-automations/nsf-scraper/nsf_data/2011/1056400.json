 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program, Professor Jacob W. Ciszek of Loyola University Chicago and his students will engage in three areas of exploration, all\r\nunified through the use of photochromic (switching) molecules, whose unique properties allow stimuli controlled and reversible changes to be induced in the underlying substrate. The areas of focus will be: 1) The effect of photochromic switching molecules on the work function and core binding energy of the substrate metal surface; 2) Determination of the distance dependence of metal surface-induced quenching of molecular\r\nadsorbate excited states, and 3) Exploration of the effect of self-assembled monolayers on the carrier density and conductivity within a semiconducting organic crystal substrate. The principal tools will be\r\norganic synthesis, infrared reflection spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Kelvin probe (for work function determination). \r\n\r\nThe aforementioned research topics have implications for the technology used in everyday life. For example, project one is relevant to organic light emitting diodes and solar cells. Projects 2 and 3 are relevant to\r\nthe emerging field of molecular electronics. Project 2 also has implications for luminescence-based biosensing technologies. The research activity in the Ciszek laboratory will also have educational\r\nimplications, through the training of graduate and undergraduate students, the on-going development of a semester-long course in nanoscience, and the participation of Ciszek research group members in\r\nannual workshops on scientific research targeted at high school audiences. Professor Ciszek and his students will also participate in a series of science seminars for the general public. Future innovations in\r\nthis area include the adaptation of selected topics in the nanoscience course for the general public seminars.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report - CAREER: Control of Substrate Electronic States via Photochromic (Switching) Molecular Adsorbates\n\n \n\nThis grant supported studies on the adsorption of photochromophore (switching) molecules onto the surface of metals, and onto organic semiconductors.  The interface of these two materials is at the heart of modern electronic devices, and often the majority of inefficiency exists at the interface as well. When studying the adsorption on metals, we examined whether the molecules could be used to move the metal?s energy level (work function) into alignment with the semiconductor eliminating contact resistance.  An increase in the contact potential demonstrated the validity of this approach.  By using a molecular switch, this interface can be designed to be stimuli responsive leading to smart lighting, or other technologies.  When studying the surface adsorption on semiconductors, we have focused on development of surface chemistry for accomplishing this.  Here we have applied the classic Diels-Alder chemistry to afford change to the surface of the organic semiconductor.  The surface reaction varies dramatically from those on standard inorganic surfaces as the chemistry is highly dependent on the orientation of the molecules which make up the surface (inorganic surfaces are nominally isotropic) and is challenging due to the weak forces which hold the semiconductor surface together.  This work represents the first rationally designed chemistry for modifying organic semiconductor surfaces. \n\n \n\nIn addition to the scientific studies (and the societal benefit felt via modern electronics) this grant also supported outreach to high school teachers and students.  Specifically to the teachers, this consisted of information how students? electronic devices (i.e. cell phones) could be used to both engage students, and illustrate chemistry concepts such as discrete energy levels and light emission.  Topic also included the students? transition from high school chemistry to collegiate chemistry.  The grant also supported our emerging scientists workshop where 30-40 high school students are brought to college for a day of modern experiments.  The experiments that the students perform consists of real research that occurs daily at Loyola University, and through the course of a day the high school students gain an understanding of what a career in science entails.  Participant schools included suburban public, urban public, and urban private and covered all ranges of socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/18/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jacob W Ciszek"
