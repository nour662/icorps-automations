 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project covers travel and lodging support for graduate students to attend the workshop on Future Internet Architectures.  The Future Internet Workshop (FIW) is focused on presentations from students on their new work on questions of Future Internet Architecture, providing an opportunity for students to interact with both other students and with senior people from the telecommunications industry (e.g., Cisco, Deutsche Telekom, Comcast, etc.). The workshop to be held on June 9th and 10th at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA hosts 22 students.\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT: Twelve of the students attending are presenting talks exploring various technical approaches to architecture of a future internet, including fault&#1049458;tolerance, malware detection, new forms of multicast, and new approaches to debugging distributed software systems. \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT: The Internet has impacts far beyond the technologies, and the values inherent in the design of a Future Internet will strongly affect the uses and applications of that Internet. An example would be healthcare data, a kind of information that many people are uncomfortable putting on the Internet today, and may be even less comfortable with in a cloud-based future Internet. Approaches to security and availability and other technical issues must be consistent with societal, governing and economic issues. The workshop has technology leaders from the Internet service providers as invited speakers and provides students (a population from which future technology leaders will be drawn) with an opportunity to hear these speakers and interact with them to understand issues beyond the technology.",
