This is a classic question, and a significant amount of research has identified biographic and contextual factors that shape movement participation.  However, we know little about the degree to which the substance of issues problematized by social movements affects their ability to recruit participants and resources. This dissertation research seeks to address this gap by assessing whether some issues are inherently more powerful or appealing than others in attracting public support -- and if so, why. To address this question, the project is grounded in social psychological theory (specifically, Affect Control Theory), which helps gauge cultural meanings associated with identities and behaviors and thus helps identify enduring, systematic trends in the way people evaluate and perceive events that go beyond personal histories. Central hypotheses derived from this theory are tested by means of a vignette-based experiment. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe findings from this research have broader implications for society, such as providing information to the non-profit sector or to policy makers. Findings from his study could help to explain the popular appeal of some issues, and indicate why other issues that may be important to address for the well-being of society may not have found sizeable public support.",
