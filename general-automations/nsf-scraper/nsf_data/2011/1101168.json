 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports two one-day workshops for US and European non-marine ostracode specialists, with a focus on northern hemisphere Quaternary and modern taxa, to develop collaborative research initiatives relevant to urgent societal questions concerning climate change impacts, changes in biodiversity, changes in water quality and supply in aquifers and surface waters. The first workshop, organized by Dr. Alison Smith (Kent State University), Dr. David Horne (University of London) and Dr. Martin Gross (Universal Museum Joanneum in Austria), will be held immediately following the European Ostracodologists Meeting (EOM) in Graz, Austria in July 2011. The second workshop will take place immediately following the Geological Society of America meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina in November 2012. Approximately 45 scientists and students are expected to attend each of these workshops, with approximately 15 U.S. scientists and students funded by this grant.\r\n\r\nNon-marine ostracodes are microscopic crustaceans commonly found in almost all non-marine aquatic habitats and are important proxies of climatic and environmental change.  These organisms produce easily fossilized calcite shells, and are an abundant record used for ecological, geochemical, and molecular phylogenetic research. Previous results suggest that analyses at larger spatial scales should enable researchers to ask fundamental questions, test hypotheses, and gain new insights in the fields of ecology, molecular genetics, paleoclimatology, and hydrology. These workshops will 1) establish an international dialogue for collaborative research; 2) explore the development of linked datasets, cross-training of graduate students, and establishment of taxonomic harmonization procedures; and 3) produce a research agenda and results dissemination plan.\r\n\r\nThis award is jointly supported by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering and Division of Earth Sciences.",

The study of these micro-crustaceans has many applications to real world problems, including water quality analysis, petroleum and gas exploration, and changing environmental conditions. Biologists, chemists and geologists use the information provided by the distribution and environmental tolerances of these organisms to better understand the natural and human-induced changes occurring in the world around us.\nThe goal of these workshops was to bring interested researchers and their graduate students together to identify significant research targets in Northern Hemisphere Quaternary non-marine ostracode research, and to suggest solutions to common impediments to international collaborative research.  This was the first time such a planning scheme was presented in the ostracode research group, as the traditional purpose of meetings is to discuss completed research rather than future initiatives.  We planned two workshops, one in July 2011 in Graz, Austria at the European Ostracodologists Meeting, and one at the National Geological Society of America meeting in November, 2012 in Charlotte, North Carolina.  We included pre-organized discussion groups in order to make the most of our limited time, following best practices of international scientific workshops of a similar nature in other fields.\n   This project was very successful. Forty scientists and their graduate students from 9 countries attended these workshops.  Of the 40, 10 were graduate students, 2 were new faculty, and the remainder were mid-career with a few senior scientists.  The two workshops were held as originally planned.  Also, we were able to hold an additional workshop at no cost to the grant, as a half-day session  at a third venue, the International German Ostracodologists Meeting (IGOM) in K&ouml;ln in October of 2012.  This allowed us to meet with colleagues who could not attend the other two workshops.  We accomplished all this within budget.  U.S. students attending these workshops benefited from meeting and discussing scientific issues with international scientists and students.  Such workshops provide needed platforms for the development of innovative ideas and new approaches to research.\nThe workshops developed 20 recommendations, ranging from the need to develop protocols for DNA and sample data recording, to ways to enable student exchanges across international boundaries.  We found common research interests that allowed us to elaborate on future research initiatives that will make use of the ostracode record in tracking process dynamics in past and present environmental and climate changes.  \n\nIntellectual Merit:    The results of this project are likely to make a considerable impact on information resources that form infrastructure, particularly in adding data to large databases such as Neotoma.org, BioFresh.org, and Paleodb.org.  The outcomes of these workshops feed directly into the NSF Earthcube mission, which is to use cyberinfrastructure to connect scientists and databases in efficient and useful ways to advance research applications.\nBroader Impacts:  These workshops directly impacted scientists and students, who in turn impact society through better communication using web services and linked databases.  Ostracode data are used for society's benefit to understand and develop water supplies, oil and gas deposits, biodiversity changes, and climate changes.  By improving the connectivity among international scientists and students, faster and more efficient result..."
