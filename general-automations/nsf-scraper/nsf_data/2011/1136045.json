 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harnessing wind energy is one of the pressing challenges of our time. The scale, complexity, and robustness of wind power systems present compelling cyber-physical system design issues. Leveraging the physical infrastructure at Purdue, this project aims to develop comprehensive computational infrastructure for distributed real-time control. In contrast to traditional efforts that focus on programming-in-the-small, this project emphasizes programmability, robustness, longevity, and assurance of integrated wind farms. The design of the proposed computational infrastructure is motivated by, and validated on, complex cyber-physical interactions underlying Wind Power Engineering. There are currently no high-level tools for expressing coordinated behavior of wind farms. Using the proposed cyber-physical system, the project aims to validate the thesis that integrated control techniques can significantly improve performance, reduce downtime, improve predictability of maintenance, and enhance safety in operational environments.\r\n\r\nThe project has significant broader impact. Wind energy in the US is the fastest growing source of clean, renewable domestically produced energy. Improvements in productivity and longevity of this clean energy source, even by a few percentage points will have significant impact on the overall energy landscape and decision-making. Mitigating failures and enhancing safety will go a long way towards shaping popular perceptions of wind farms -- accelerating broader acceptance within local communities. Given the relative infancy of \"smart\" wind farms, the potential of the project cannot be overstated.",
