 "awd_abstract_narration": "1110876, Akay\r\n\r\nThe biological sciences have become more quantitative and information-driven science since emerging computational and mathematical tools facilitate collection and analysis of vast amounts of biological data. Complexity analysis of biological systems provides biological knowledge for the organization, management and mining of biological data by using advanced computational tools. The biological data are inherently complex and non-uniform and collected at multiple temporal and spatial scales. The investigations of complex biological systems and processes require an extensive collaboration between biologists, mathematicians, computer scientists and engineering to improve our understanding of complex biological process from gene to system.\r\n\t\r\nThe main objective of this summer school is to train undergraduate, graduate biological science students and post-doctoral fellows in Bionano Science, Engineering and Technology (BNSET). The system level understanding of biology will be derived using mathematical and engineering methods to understand complex biological processes. It will expose the attendees with biology background to the latest technological developments. It will also be helpful to students in computer science and mathematics who are interested in doing research in BNSET, since the summer school provides exceptional insights into the fundamental challenges in science, medicine and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe summer schools are excellent learning, teaching and brain storming opportunities\r\nfor students, post-docs and young researchers as well as the summer school faculty.  The summer school will stimulate further interdisciplinary research and collaborations among engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, and medical researchers, and will help in identifying new, challenging directions in complex biological science and bioengineering research with focus on bionano science, engineering and technology. This project will support the travel of 10 people (7 graduate students and 3 post-doctoral fellows) the 10th International Summer School on Biocomplexity from System to Gene to be held in Istanbul, Turkey on July 1-7, 2011; these students and faculty will interact with the participants from Turkey and other countries.",
