 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is aimed at: (i) demonstrating a novel THz emitter/source device consisting of orientation patterned (OP) Quasi Phase-matching (QPM) optically nonlinear GaN structures that would be optically pumped by a commercially available high power ultrafast fiber laser, and (ii) establishing a strong foundation at the University of Alabama to enable translation of this THz technology to the marketplace.   The proposed approach and device structure consists of designing and implementing a prototype device that yields THz radiation at room temperature when excited by short optical pulses and/or high power CW lasers, with the added benefit of being easily tunable at THz frequencies and able produce coherent THz radiation with narrow bandwidth.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impact of the proposed activity stems from the potential of the developed THz source to generate useful non-ionizing Terahertz radiation for medical imaging and, thus, provide an alternative to dangerous x-rays. With the support of the University's Alabama Innovation and Mentoring of Entrepreneur Center, this project will also train and engage students and a postdoctoral researcher in both entrepreneurial thinking and practice. This project will provide a platform for students and the postdoctoral fellow to establish a start-up company to translate the developed THz source technology to the marketplace.",
