Mathematical research of general relativity is a significant and active part of mathematics. In fact it becomes increasingly a major source of inspirations for mathematical researches in the fields of differential geometry and differential equations.\r\n\r\nThe proposed summer program will host one week research conference and invite four experts in the field to teach mini-courses in the rest two weeks. The proposed program is inviting many graduate students and young people in the field both from China and US. The proposed program will provide international travel to the participants, particularly, students or young researchers, from US.",
