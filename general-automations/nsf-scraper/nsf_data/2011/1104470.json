This is currently the most\r\ngeneral and most comprehensive theory of symplectic\r\ninvariants. There are three ingredients to this project, namely\r\nthe polyfold Fredholm theory, the scale-smooth analysis and the\r\nformulation of SFT as an algebraic presentation of the solution\r\ncount of a polyfold Fredholm problem with operations.  The second\r\nsubproject, a by-product of the polyfold Fredholm theory,\r\nattempts to construct a homology theory based on equivalence\r\nclasses of Fredholm problems. The resulting advantage would be\r\nthat transversality issues in studying nonlinear partial\r\ndifferential equations would actually not occur explicitly. They\r\nwould be hidden in the (one-time) proof that the new homology\r\ntheory of a space would be naturally isomorphic to the rational\r\nsingular homology.  A third subproject is concerned with finite\r\nenergy foliations, either in the context of area-preserving\r\ndisk-maps or the restricted planar three-body problem. Finite\r\nenergy foliations were introduced by the PI and his collaborators\r\nand are an important tool in the study of the dynamics of\r\nlow-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. The restricted circular\r\nplanar three-body problem is not only interesting from a purely\r\nacademic viewpoint, but is also used in the orbit design for\r\nscientific space missions. In certain regimes of the Jacobi\r\nenergy, finite energy foliations allow to reduce the dynamics of\r\nthe restricted three-body problem to that of the dynamics of an\r\narea-preserving disk-map.  Then again the same theory facilitates\r\nthe understanding of the long-term behavior of iterated\r\narea-preserving disk maps. The project will study the\r\nrelationship between the theory of finite energy foliations, a\r\nsymplectic construction, and core dynamical systems notions like\r\nentropy.\r\n\r\nIt is a surprising fact that many physical systems evolving in\r\ntime, allow a description as a Hamiltonian system. Systems of\r\nthis kind describe the flow of an incompressible ideal fluid, the\r\nmovement of a satellite under the gravitational forces of\r\ncelestial bodies, or the movement of charged particles in a\r\nmagnetic field. Hamiltonian systems are a very particular class\r\nof dynamical systems, which can be studied not only by the\r\nmethods from dynamical systems theory, but also by a more exotic\r\nkind of geometry called symplectic geometry. This is a geometry\r\nbased on the notion of area, in contrast to usual geometries,\r\nwhich have length and distance as their fundamental\r\nnotions. Recent advances in this field already found some\r\npractical uses.  For example, this novel point of view has been\r\nused in accelerator physics in algorithms controlling and\r\ninsuring stability of a beam of particles and called symplectic\r\ntracking.  It is the explicit purpose of this research to\r\nintegrate the approaches to Hamiltonian systems coming from these\r\ntwo different perspectives. This should result in new methods,\r\nwhich should make it possible to attack problems, which so far\r\nseemed unreachable. For example it seems long term be feasible to\r\nuse the new methods to develop algorithms, which would find\r\nfuel-efficient orbits for scientific space missions. Current\r\ntechnology can verify the properties of proposed orbits extremely\r\nfast. However, currently there is no good method for finding such\r\norbits. It rather compares to finding a needle in a haystack,\r\nusing very large amounts of computing time.",
