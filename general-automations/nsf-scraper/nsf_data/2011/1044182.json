 "awd_abstract_narration": "The POET (Purdue Optimization modeling Education Tool) Project is creating, evaluating, and disseminating a web-based interactive learning environment for teaching students how to formulate valid and tractable optimization models. Optimization is a key component of an industrial engineering curriculum and an essential part of other areas of engineering, the natural sciences, and business administration; however, many students find it difficult to build effective optimization models. The project is gaining insights into how students learn mathematical optimization modeling in order to show that novice students can better formulate valid optimization models when provided with visualization tools for guiding self-assessment and enhancing conceptual understanding. The project is evaluating the effectiveness of visualization in learning optimization modeling skills through measures of student performance. The team is establishing a web-based platform to raise awareness of POET and is growing a network of students and instructors around the world who use and evaluate POET.  The project brings together researchers and educators in operations research, mathematics education, and human-computer interaction. The educational insights produced by this work represent a significant step in helping instructors improve the teaching of optimization modeling.",

We next developed POETIC (Purdue Optimization modeling Education Tool - Interactive Component), an interactive visualization tool, to help students overcome one of these errors, the \"reversal error.\" This involves the reversal of natural referents for symbols (e.g., writing 6S=P when told that there are six times as many professors as students).

POET includes additional feedback mechanisms where students can send their linear programs directly to a linear programming solver and automatically include the solver\u00c6s optimal solutions in their list of test cases. \n\n \nTo evaluate the POET tool, we gave three online assignments to a class of 156 engineering students enrolled in an Optimization course.

Our results show that POET did not drastically improve students\u00c6 modeling skills, but did help them avoid particular types of errors. Additionally, through tracking students\u00c6 behaviors on the tool, we were able to capture details on the ways in which students worked through these assignments.  We have used this data to better understand both their problem solving strategies and how POET serves their needs.  Using the data gathered, we have refined the tool and added new suggested features or deleted features that have not proven useful.\n\n \nThe final POET tool is accessible to instructors and students through a web-based homework assignment system: https://engineering.purdue.edu/POET/wiki/pmwiki.p..."
