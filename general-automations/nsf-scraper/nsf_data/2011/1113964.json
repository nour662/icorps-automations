 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the effort to design and\r\nprototype a new high-performance but low-cost integrated robotic manipulator comprising of the tight\r\nintegration of mechanical, electrical, and computational subsystems. A significant part of the effort is to\r\naddress the computational challenges involved in developing a new generation of intelligent robotic\r\nmanipulators. Real-time general vision processing and dexterous planning, for example, are not\r\nfeasible using conventional embedded processors. The consequence is that advanced robotic\r\napplications are only possible in environments where the robotic arm can outsource computationally\r\nexpensive processes to more powerful computers. Low-power, High-Performance Computing (HPC)\r\nclusters will be used to extend what is currently possible in autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic\r\nmanipulator systems. Therefore a research effort is to develop a scalable high-level intelligence\r\nframework applied to robotic manipulators, and to implement robust and real-time algorithms that take\r\nadvantage of highly parallel computing environments. Application computations will integrate\r\nseamlessly across wireless and wired networks of heterogeneous robotic and computer systems. The\r\ngoal is a highly capable, computationally scalable, low-cost intelligent robotic arm platform for\r\nresearch and light industry, which can easily be adapted to a variety of complex applications.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to fill a market niche between the low-end\r\nrobotic manipulators that have little commercial potential and the high-end robotic arms that are\r\nexpensive and have high operating costs for setup and operation. High-performance computation\r\nintegrated with advanced robotic manipulator systems are applicable for agile light industry and other\r\ndesktop manipulator applications in unstructured environments. This will have a tremendous impact on\r\nthe future of commercial robotics and make capable robotic systems affordable to small manufacturing\r\nbusinesses. Highly parallel computing power will greatly increase the range of applications and\r\nenvironments to which robots are suited. For example, an intelligent robotic manipulator can be used in\r\nagricultural applications or autonomously caring for plants in highly unstructured environments. The\r\nsame manipulator could easily be adapted for use in a classroom setting; with a simple scripting\r\ninterface students can experiment with advanced robotic control, allowing them to concentrate on\r\ndiscovering exciting new applications. This creates a broad market in academic and industrial settings,\r\nboth for highly-capable, low-cost intelligent robotic manipulators for agile manufacturing and for lowpower\r\nHPC clusters applied to sensor network integration solutions in general.",

RoadNarrows leveraged the company's current research into low-power HPC clusters and General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GP/GPUs) to extend what is currently possible in autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic manipulator systems. \n\nRoadNarrows conceived a high-level software interface for a set of advanced control and sensing algorithms implemented in Message Passing Interface (MPI) and CUDA, NVIDIA's parallel computing architecture.  The high-level software framework was partially implemented during Phase I as a set of proxy-server control modules which may be distributed over a network.  Further work remains in developing robust parallel algorithms for sensing and control. \n\nIn conjunction with the software effort, RoadNarrows continued the research and development of a family of low-cost commercial robot arms, known as HekaterosTM  (see Figure 1), ideal for integrating low-power HPC clusters.
