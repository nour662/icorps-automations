The 2011 Photosynthesis GRS and GRC will present cutting-edge research focusing on topics of emerging importance in photosynthesis research that urgently need to be addressed.  Photosynthesis is the biological process that converts solar energy into chemical energy, providing the raw materials for growth, development, and reproduction of photosynthetic microbes and plants, which are sources of food, fiber, and fuel for humans.  The goal is to inspire the photosynthesis research community to address these pressing scientific and societal problems. The specific objectives of the 2011 Photosynthesis GRS/GRC are: (1) to provide a forum for presentation and in-depth discussion of the latest, cutting-edge research on photosynthesis, (2) to promote interdisciplinary interactions and collaboration in photosynthesis research, and (3) to advance the careers of junior scientists and to inspire the next generation of photosynthesis researchers.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe 2011 Photosynthesis Gordon Research Seminar and Conference anticipates significant participation by graduate students and postdocs from underrepresented groups.  The Chair of the Gordon Research Seminar is a female graduate student who is a member of an underrepresented group, and she will actively recruit participants from universities that serve diverse populations.   In addition, approximately 10 junior investigators will be selected as GRS speakers from submitted abstracts, and eight of the 33 invited GRC speakers and discussion leaders are graduate students, postdocs, or Assistant Professors. The representation of female speakers and discussion leaders at the GRC exceeds the typical percentage of Photosynthesis GRC attendees, and one of the GRC speakers has a major physical disability.",
