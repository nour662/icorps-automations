 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gregory Beran of the University of California at Riverside is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to develop a computational method that enables the efficient and reliable prediction of molecular crystal structures and properties.  The model will combine a quantum mechanical treatment of individual molecules and their dominant interactions with a classical treatment, while weaker interactions are being approximated using a computationally inexpensive classical polarizable force field.  This project has three principle objectives: to develop the model into a practical computational tool, to benchmark the performance of the model on a set of well-studied molecular crystals, and to apply this model to several challenging crystal structure prediction problems. \r\n\r\nThis research will help make it possible to predict, before any experiments are performed, how molecules pack together in solid-state crystals.  Crystal packing affects useful properties such as the solubility of pharmaceuticals in the body, the charge-carrier performance of organic semi-conductor materials, the detonation of energetic materials, and efficiency of solid-state chemical reactions. The research will provide new insights into the physical interactions that govern crystal packing and into how these can be controlled to design new high-performance molecular materials.\r\n",

For example, the majority of pharmaceuticals are delivered in crystalline form, and surveys indicate that 1 in 2 drugs exhibits multiple crystal packing forms, or polymorphs. Crystal packing can affect how readily a drug tablet dissolves in the body, and an insoluble crystal polymorph will prevent the drug molecules from having their intended effect in the patient.  Indeed, drug recalls of ritonavir (HIV), rotigotine (Parkinson's disease) and carbamazepine (seizures) have been linked to unexpected occurrences of insoluble crystal polymorphs.  To understand polymorphism in existing drugs and to ward off potential problems in new drugs, there is a considerable need to understand which polymorphs might form and to predict the properties of those polymorphs.  Crystal polymorphism also affects many other practical branches of chemistry, ranging from foods to organic semiconductor materials.\n\nModeling molecular crystals requires a careful treatment of the variety of interactions that occur between atoms within a molecule and between different molecules.  Brute force calculations which would be sufficiently accurate to describe these interactions reliably are computationally intractable.  Through this project, we developed a new practical and accurate method for predicting structures and properties of molecular crystals using high-performance computing.\n\nThe new model relies on viewing the entire crystal in terms of overlapping fragments, each containing a small number of molecules.  Performing accurate calculations on each fragment proves much more managable, and the results from the different fragment calculations can be combined to predict the properties of the crystal as a whole.  This method has provided benchmark results for predicting the overall stability of the crystal and the stability differences between different crystal polymorphs.  The results predicted using this model have served as benchmarks which other researchers have sought to reproduce using their own models.\n\nWhile much of the research focused on fundamental model development, several applications to chemically interesting systems were also performed during the project.  Most notably, we investigated the polymorphism of aspirin and the hydrogen ordering in ice XV.  In aspirin, the second polymorph was discovered only in the past decade, and our calculations demonstrated that the two forms exhibit nearly identical thermodynamic stabilities.  We provided an explanation for how the different crystal packing affects the nature of the interactions and how those interactions drive the overall stabilities.  \n\nThe complex behavior of ice under pressure continues to amaze scientists, and ice XV is the fifteenth and most recent phase of ice to be discovered. There has been considerable confusion regarding the manner in which the water molecules orient themselves in this phase, and our theoretical predictions provided new insights into their potential arrangements.\n\nIn the end, studies like these on aspirin and ice provide deeper insights into the nature of crystal packing.  Better understanding of these forces will facilitate efforts to engineer new crystal forms with desirable properties for applications in the pharmaceutical industry and elsewhere.\n\nThis funding resulted in 15 publications, 14 of which were peer reviewed.  Six PhD graduate students, one postdoctoral scholar, and three undergraduates received training through the project.  Four of the students were women, and two come from traditionally underrepresented demographic groups. The project supported the participation of the principal investigator and graduate students at multiple scientific conferences in the United States and abroad. The software tools developed here are being made available to the public free of charge with open-source licensing.                                             \n\n\t\t..."
