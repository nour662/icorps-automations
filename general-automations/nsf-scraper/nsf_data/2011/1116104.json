 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims at developing  new theories and techniques to\r\nbetter understand and manage shared memory cache in multi-core architectures. \r\nThe core concept is program footprint, which is the amount of memory access in a period of\r\nexecution.  Complete measurement requires counting data access in all\r\nexecution windows, which is too costly.  This\r\nresearch develops computational methods to first make all-window\r\nanalysis feasible through a set of new profiling algorithms and then\r\nmake this analysis cost-effective by reducing the cost through statistical\r\ninference, sampling, and parallel profiling and effectively obtaining\r\nthis information in real time as a program executes.  Footprint\r\ninformation is essential in analyzing cache sharing between programs\r\nand program tasks.  It enables the second part of the project, a set\r\nof tools that predict the performance of parallel workloads without\r\nparallel testing.  In addition, the footprint information enables a\r\nfundamentally different approach to common techniques.  In the third\r\npart, the project develops a new cache-hint insertion tool to\r\napproximate optimal caching  and a\r\nmemory-performance tuning tool to be  used by software developer.\r\n\r\nAs multi-core processors become commonplace and cloud computing is\r\ngaining acceptance, more applications are run in a shared environment.\r\nThe outcome of this research will fundamentally alter the way\r\nprogrammers understand and improve memory performance on multi-core\r\nsystems.  Software developers and hardware engineers will have a new\r\ntool set to tackle the complex problem of managing on-chip memory for\r\nnot just sequential but also parallel code and for not just achieving\r\ngood performance but also for ensuring stable performance in a dynamic\r\nenvironment.  The broader impacts of this research will include\r\ndeeper understanding and more precise characterization of locality\r\nin computational processes, which has implications in other\r\ncomputing-related disciplines, and memory efficient software and\r\nhardware design, which saves energy and cost and has broad economical\r\nand social benefits.",
