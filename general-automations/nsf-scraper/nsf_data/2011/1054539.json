 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project integrates a vigorous research program to understand the evolution of plants restricted to unusual soils with an equally vigorous effort to improve high school and college student understanding of core concepts in evolutionary biology.  Plant species that grow only on unusual soils, such as serpentine soils (high concentration of metals), bogs (low pH), or evaporites (high salinity), comprise a substantial proportion of plant biodiversity worldwide, but surprisingly little is known about their evolutionary history. For example, do plant lineages restricted to these unusual soils persist over long periods of evolutionary time? Likewise, how have such lineages responded to past climate changes?  This project will answer such questions using a large but poorly studied group of plants that grow only in gypsum-rich soils within the Chihuahuan Desert of the US and Mexico.  By generating and analyzing large DNA sequence data sets, the detailed evolutionary histories of 12 diverse gypsum-restricted plant groups in the Chihuahuan Desert will be reconstructed and compared.  \r\n\r\nThis international research program represents the first comprehensive effort to understand the origin and evolutionary diversification of a large, soil-restricted group of plant species, and consequently will vastly improve our understanding of how soils influence plant evolution and how soil-restricted plants will respond to ongoing climate change. This project will also provide a novel and engaging framework for improving evolutionary literacy in high school and college students, by employing a combination of high school teacher workshops, innovative undergraduate biology laboratory activities at a liberal arts college, and extensive mentoring of student researchers.",

These unique communities are comprised of resilient and sometimes bizarre plants that thrive on difficult soils such as serpentine and gypsum, which most plant species cannot tolerate. Exploring the ecology and evolution of these communities offers key insights into fundamental biological processes, including adaptation, the formation of new species, and how the physical and biological environments interact to create plant communities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gypsum plant communities represent an excellent opportunity to investigate soils as a driving force in plant evolution and ecology. Outcrops of the mineral gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) occur worldwide in dryland ecosystems and are home to a diversity of plant species that grow only on soils derived from this mineral. Gypsum soils are unique because of their unusual mineral nutrient balance (extremely high in sulfur and calcium, and poor in other key nutrients plants need to survive) and propensity for well-developed surface crusts, both of which are thought to play key roles in controlling the growth of plants on gypsum. Despite their great potential to inform us about the links between soils and plant evolution and ecology, gypsum plant communities have received much less attention compared to the plants that grow only on other unusual soils, such as serpentine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fundamental research goal of this project was to investigate patterns of plant evolution in the gypsum flora of the Chihuahuan Desert of North America using DNA sequence data. This project represents the first integrated investigation of evolution across a gypsum flora anywhere in the world. To accomplish the research goals, evolutionary studies of 20 Chihuahuan Desert plant groups containing gypsum specialist species were undertaken, leading to the publication of seven scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals and 25 presentations at national and international scientific conferences by project personnel. As part of this work, project members undertook numerous field expeditions to collect plant material in both Mexico and the US, including on many gypsum exposures previously unexplored by botanists.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The research funded by this award has led to several fundamental insights into the evolution of gypsum specialization in plants. DNA-based studies conducted for the project have documented diverse evolutionary origins for gypsum specialist plants in the Chihuahuan Desert. More importantly, integrating these evolutionary results with studies of ecology and physiology has revealed that gypsum specialists fall into two basic groups: geographically widespread species that have the ability to accumulate gypsum crystals in their leaves (presumably as a way to deal with the exceptionally high levels of sulfur in the soil), and geographically restricted species that do not. This suggests that similar adaptations to gypsum have evolved independently in diverse plant families. Moreover, the geographically widespread specialists have been shown in almost all cases to be millions of years old, suggesting that adaptations to gypsum appeared early in the evolutionary history of North American deserts. Other DNA-based work supported by this project has demonstrated that seed dispersal among different gypsum outcrops is remarkably limited. Finally, fieldwork funded by this award led to the discovery of at least 14 new plant species. More broadly, this award has provided a firm basis for years of ongoing work in the PI&rsquo;s lab to understand the evolution of this globally important ecosystem. Likewise, the nearly 4,000 botanical collections made during the course of fieldwork for this award now form the nucleus of the new Oberlin College herbarium.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This award also led to numerous broader impacts in education and training. The central educational goal of the project was to develop literacy in &ldquo;tree thinking&rdquo; (understanding and interpreting evolutionary trees) at multiple curricular levels. To accomplish this, the PI instituted an annual Tree Thinking Workshop for high school teachers in northern Ohio. The workshop was offered seven times (and will continue to be offered), leading to the training of 46 area teachers, including teachers from public, private, rural, urban, and suburban districts. In addition, the PI designed and instituted a set of lab exercises centered on tree thinking as part of an introductory Biology course at Oberlin College. These lab exercises are now deeply entrenched within the curriculum, and have led to the training of over 400 Oberlin students during the period of the award.&nbsp; The award also directly trained 44 Oberlin undergraduate students (including 32 women) who have performed mentored research funded by the award, including 14 who presented their work at national botanical conferences. The award also enabled the PI to be trained in new laboratory and field techniques, trained one postdoctoral researcher and three graduate students, and established numerous ongoing collaborations between the PI and researchers around the world. Finally, the project helped produce an educational web video on gypsum plant evolution as part of the free &ldquo;Plants Are Cool, Too!&rdquo; YouTube series:&nbsp; <a href=\"http://youtu.be/a16mBFTkrks\">http://youtu.be/a16mBFTkrks</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/01/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;J&nbsp;Moore</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1054539/1054539_10071529_1515864973689_IMG_9834--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1054539/1054539_10071529_1515864973689_IMG_9834--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"gypsum outcrop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1054539/1054539_10071529_1515864973689_IMG_9834--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"gypsum outcrop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An outcrop (center) of gypsum in northern New Mexico.
