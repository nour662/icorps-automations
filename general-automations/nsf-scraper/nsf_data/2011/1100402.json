 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the formability of viable double-layer cellular spheroids during acoustic excitation-assisted compound jetting can be predicted using scale analysis and a method-of-line numerical approach. The proposed research activities involve: 1) development of an acoustic excitation-based compound jetting apparatus with imaging capability, 2) modeling and validation of the double-layer cellular spheroid fabrication process using scale analysis and numerical simulations, and 3) size and viability evaluation of fabricated cellular spheroids. In this proposed compound jetting system, concentric core fluid (cell suspension), shell fluid (sodium alginate) and carrier stream (air) jets break into double-layer core-shell structure microcapsules under the effect of acoustic excitation.\r\n\r\nThis study will contribute to biofabrication technology. Specifically, controllable fabrication of double-layer cellular spheroids will lead to robust organ printing, enabling on-demand organ manufacturing and other microcapsule-related healthcare technologies such as drug delivery. Broader impacts also include a pipeline of well trained, motivated students ready to undertake careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics disciplines through various summer programs for research interns and promote the biomedical manufacturing curriculum development.",
