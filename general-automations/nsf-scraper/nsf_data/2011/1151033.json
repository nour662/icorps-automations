As human life expectancy increases, the number of Alzheimer\u00c6s disease patients is increasing exponentially because of the deficiency in the early diagnosis and effective treatments for Alzheimer\u00c6s disease. A major hallmark of Alzheimer\u00c6s disease is dementia is believed to be caused by plaque formation in the brain.  Amyloid-beta (A&beta;) is a peptide that is known to be a major constituent of these plaques, so this work sought to find ways to inhibit A&beta; activity with the goal of lessening plaque formation and hopefully dementia in Alzheimer\u00c6s disease patients. \n\nThis study\u00c6s approach was to design biocompatible smart materials that either sequester A&beta; or interfere with A&beta; interaction with/binding to cells. If successful, these biomimetic materials would mimic the cell surface of typical brain cells, effectively baiting A&beta; to adhere to the smart materials rather than actual brain cells.  Such smart materials were synthesized and their effects on A&beta; toxicity were measured.  Certain chemical structures were found to be especially effective in reducing the harmful effects of A&beta;.  This work will contribute to the ultimate therapeutic design of smart materials that will ideally overcome the shortcomings of current Alzheimer\u00c6s disease treatments and reduce the effects of this debilitating disease that is known to harm so many.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael G Benton"
