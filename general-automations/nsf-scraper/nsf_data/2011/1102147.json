 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches:\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to create the first spherical induction motor with unlimited rotation and to characterize its performance, principally for use as a spherical robot wheel.  The outcome offers reduced mechanical complexity and higher performance when compared with traditional mechanical methods. The approach concentrates on the inductance principle, depending heavily on material characterization, 3D magnetic simulation, solid modeling, electronic circuit design, and real-time software development, keeping in mind the primary application to dynamically stable single-wheel robots. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe research develops a spherical induction motor permitting direct torque generation and rotation about arbitrary axes with a minimum of mechanical friction or backlash. The results provide an exemplar for a new class of motor, permitting quantitative comparisons with more traditional solutions. The successful outcome simplifies mechanics, improves performance, and lowers the cost of dynamically stable single-wheel mobile robots.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe research investigates important issues in the technology of direct drive spherical actuation which are likely to be generally applicable. The research enhances what is already a new and different approach to mobile robot locomotion, furthering the strong public interest in dynamically stable mobile robots around the world.  Besides research experiences for students working on the project, course work offered by two different departments at Carnegie Mellon University is enhanced, exposing students to issues of electromagnetic design, manufacturing, and characterization. The outreach activities expose high school students to hands-on research. There is strong international collaboration with Tohoku Gakuin University in Japan.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project develops an electric motor technology having a spherical rotor.  The motor is based on a magnetic induction principle wherein traveling magnetic waves are created in the rotor to produce torques and continuous motion around arbitrary axes.  Further, the motion of the rotor is tracked by optical sensors based on optical computer mice.  The resulting combination of actuation and sensing allows closed-loop operation of the motor.  Thus the velocity (speed and direction) as well as the angular position of the rotor is controlled.  A patent is pending on the developed technology, and a paper was published in the 2015 International Conference on Robotics and Automation.  The main benefit of a closed-loop spherical induction motor (SIM) is that it allows controlled motion in any direction with only a single moving part.  There are several possibilities for industrial use for such a technology.\n\nFurther, beyond the scope of the funded project, initial results were obtained where the developed SIM was incorporated as the prime mover in a ballbot-type mobile robot.  The rotor of the SIM serves as the ball wheel of the robot.  Balancing, yaw motion, and point to point motion is demonstrated with results reported in the 2016 International Conference on Robotics and Automation.  The main benefit of this technology is that it enables mobile robots to be created having only two moving parts; a body and a ball.  Because of this, nearly all of the traditional mechanics associated with mobile robot locomotion is eliminated. A provisional patent is being submitted.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/11/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ralph L Hollis"
