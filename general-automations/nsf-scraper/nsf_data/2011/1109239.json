 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to study how secondary mathematics teacher preparation programs to provide preservice teachers opportunities to develop knowledge for teaching algebra and address algebra expectations in state-level policies and the Common Core State Standards for mathematics (CCSSM). It is designed to answer two important research questions: (1) What opportunities do secondary mathematics teacher preparation programs provide to learn about algebra, algebra teaching, and issues in achieving equity in algebra learning? And (2) In what ways do secondary mathematics teacher preparation programs address the algebra, functions, and modeling standards and mathematical practices described in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM)? \r\n\r\nMixed-methods will be employed in this research project, including developing, piloting, refining, and administering data collection instruments and protocols for a web-based large-scale national program survey, case studies of teacher preparation programs, and focus group interviews with student teachers.  This project focuses on algebra, an important topic in mathematics education that has been described as both the fundamental to learn advanced mathematics and a gatekeeper for success  \r\n\r\nThere is no any national survey about pre-service teachers? opportunities to develop knowledge for teaching algebra in the literature, therefore, this project will fill a gap in the literature.  This project addresses critical issues with national significance about teacher preparation.  In particular, this proposed project is well-positioned and needed to address issues raised in the National Research Council and PCAST Reports about the need for information related to the content of teacher education programs and the need for teachers with strong content and pedagogical knowledge for teaching algebra.  This project will address the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) by examining how closely aligned the current national teacher preparation programs with the CCSSM.  The findings shall have broad policy implications regarding teacher preparation.",
