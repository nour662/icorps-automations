Locomotion offers a unique opportunity to probe issues of neuronal organization because motor circuitry generates a measurable product ? movement. Thus, studies of neural circuits for movement can not only help understand how the nervous system functions in general, but can also help to repair the motor circuitry after it has been disrupted, either by injury or disease. To fully grasp how to address the clinical challenges of overcoming neuronal disease or injury, it is informative to look for solutions in natural processes. This proposal is focused on the fundamental science underlying this transformational vision. The NU team will concentrate on discovering and understanding the function of spinal motor circuitry of a model system: the zebrafish.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: A major drawback of modern computational models is considered to be that the patterns of connectivity among spinal neurons are largely assumed. With a large parameter space, the assumed neural circuitry in the computational models, that mimic natural behavior, may not be the actual circuitry in organisms. The NU team has designed a research approach based on the hypothesis that information about the required muscle forcing for movement can be used to discover the actual neural circuitry. Hence, instead of assuming any neural circuitry, they propose a novel inverse paradigm in which they will first identify the muscle forcing required to produce the observed swimming kinematics. Second, they will construct possible neural circuits that could lead to the predicted muscle forcing. Finally, they will use transgenic zebrafish lines to hunt for classes of neurons predicted by the modeling, but as yet unidentified. \r\nTransformational impact: This project will lead to the discovery of new classes of neurons and the related circuitry, and to a fundamental understanding of how neuronal activation leads to a sequence of events in which the muscle energy is focused and transformed into the translational kinetic energy of movement. These fundamental discoveries and insights will not be restricted to the zebrafish model system but will conceptually apply in general to vertebrates whose movements range from swimming to limbed locomotion.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The PIs will develop new interdisciplinary courses. The work done in this proposal will be a crucial application example that will be introduced in a book on computational methods that the PI is writing. The PI is also developing a novel approach based on computer animation to teach the fundamental principles in his research field. These educational videos will be broadly distributed through the internet by using YouTube.",

The key findings summarized below accomplish these goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impact: </strong>The results are relevant not only from the perspective of understanding a biological system but also to design bio-inspired underwater vehicles. Students trained on this grant acquired interdisciplinary training in biology, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and computational techniques.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary outcome 1:</strong> Examples of animals evolving similar traits despite the absence of that trait in the last common ancestor, such as the wing and camera-type lens eye in vertebrates and invertebrates, are called cases of convergent evolution. Instances of convergent evolution of locomotory patterns that quantitatively agree with the mechanically optimal solution are very rare. We have shown that, with respect to a very diverse group of aquatic animals, a mechanically optimal method of swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrate and invertebrate swimmers across three different phyla (Image 1). Specifically, if we take the length of an undulation along an animal&rsquo;s fin during swimming and divide it by the mean amplitude of undulations along the fin length, the result is consistently around twenty. We call this value the optimal specific wavelength (OSW). We show that the OSW maximizes the force generated by the body, which also maximizes swimming speed. We hypothesize a mechanical basis for this optimality and suggest reasons for its repeated emergence through evolution.</p>\n<p>Building on the above work, we also found that a wide range of body/caudal fin (BCF) swimmers, from larval zebrafish and herring to fully&ndash;grown eels, use specific wavelength (ratio of wavelength to tail amplitude of undulation) values that fall within a relatively narrow range (Image 2). It was found that there is an optimal specific wavelength (OSW) that maximizes the swimming speed and thrust generated by an undulatory swimmer in general. The observed values of specific wavelength for BCF animals are relatively close to this OSW. The mechanisms underlying the maximum propulsive thrust for BCF swimmers are quantified and are found to be consistent with the mechanisms hypothesized in prior work, above. The adherence to an optimal value of specific wavelength in most natural hydrodynamic propulsors gives rise to empirical design criteria for man&ndash;made propulsors.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary outcome 2: </strong>Undulatory motion in aquatic animals is orchestrated by caudally propagating waves of neural activity that stimulate skeletal muscles bringing fourth contraction waves. The resultant muscle bending moments, constitutive forces originating from the animal&rsquo;s viscoelastic body, and hydrodynamic forces determine the deformation kinematics for swimming. Fully resolved fluid flow simulations of neurally controlled locomotion may facilitate experimental neurobiologists in identifying and decoding activation patterns needed for a behavioral outcome in swimming animals. Neurally activated swimming dynamically increases muscle stiffness and consequently the effective body stiffness. Computationally resolving large deformations for a stiff, viscoelastic body immersed in fluid is expensive. In methods that explicitly couple the fluid-body interactions, the large elastic modulus of the body severely limits the timestep size permitted to retain numerical stability. Fully implicit methods generally are no more computationally efficient. When a body is sufficiently stiff, the realized deformation kinematics closely follow the preferred or reference configuration due to the muscle bending moments. Rather than resolving the numerically stiff elastic equations for the body, a fast and efficient, constraint-based self-propulsion formulation is employed to directly impose the swimming kinematics. With this approach, the exploration of neuromechanically driven propulsion using fully resolved computational fluid dynamics becomes feasible (Image 3). The developed method is robust and may be employed to investigate the neuromechanics of motor control and locomotion. Simulations demonstrating the neural activation patterns&rsquo; effect on maneuverability and speed are demonstrated (Image 4). Dynamic adaptations in neural activity influenced by proprioceptive feedback is simulated for the case of a swimmer navigating through an obstructing flow (Image 5).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/31/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Neelesh&nbsp;A&nbsp;Patankar</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1066575/1066575_10107463_1490988327093_SW-Phylogeny-genus-species_vert--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1066575/1066575_10107463_1490988327093_SW-Phylogeny-genus-species_vert--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Undulatory median/paired fin swimmer phylogenetic relationships and SW = ? / a?, where ? and a? are wavelength and mean amplitude of undulations present along the fin, respectively.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1066575/1066575_10107463_1490988327093_SW-Phylogeny-genus-species_vert--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Undulatory median/paired fin swimmer phylogenetic relationships and SW = ? / a?, where ? and a? are wavelength and mean amplitude of undulations present along the fin, respectively.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The eight instances of independent emergence of elongated median/paired fin swimming are highlighted in blue.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hans Dappen, George Burgess, Juan Aguere, Nicolai Johannesen, Sandstein, Clinton & Charles Robertson, Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, Mark Sabaj, Masashi Kawasaki, Rahul Bale, Izaak Neveln, Amneet Bhalla, Malcolm MacIver, Neelesh Patankar.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Neelesh&nbsp;A&nbsp;Patankar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Undulatory median/paired fin swimmer phylogenetic relationships and SW = ? / a?, where ? and a? are wavelength and mean amplitude of undulations present along the fin, respectively.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1066575/1066575_10107463_1490989796068_OSW_BCF--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1066575/1066575_10107463_1490989796068_OSW_BCF--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Observed specific wavelength ranges of body/caudal fin swimmers.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1066575/1066575_10107463_1490989796068_OSW_BCF--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Observed specific wavelength ranges of body/caudal fin swimmers.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The specific wavelength, defined as ratio of wavelength to maximum amplitude, is clustered around 10 for undulatory swimmers.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nishant Nangia, Neelesh Patankar.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Neelesh&nbsp;A&nbsp;Patankar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Observed specific wavelength ranges of body/caudal fin swimmers.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1066575/1066575_10107463_1490990048626_eel3d--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1066575/1066575_10107463_1490990048626_eel3d--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Neuromechanical simulation of a 3D eel.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1066575/1066575_10107463_1490990048626_eel3d--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Neuromechanical simulation of a 3D eel.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Neural signal pattern is specified and coupled with body and fluid dynamics.
