The overall goal of his travel is to solidify the research goals and mentorship structure of a proposal, tentatively entitled Antlers of the Arctic: Landscape bone accumulations as a source of historical ecological and biogeographic data on caribou calving grounds, for submisstion to OPPs Postdoctoral Fellowships in Polar Regions Research program. He will present a seminar, engage in individual and group meetings, tour several laboratory facilities, and also meet with personnel at the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program to discuss ways of incorporating students of native descent into his proposed research program.",
