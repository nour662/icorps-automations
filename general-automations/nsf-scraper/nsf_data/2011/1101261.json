 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to investigate a variety of problems in the\r\nanalytic theory of automorphic forms, especially problems\r\nconcerning higher rank groups such as the general linear\r\ngroup of degree 3 and higher.  In particular, the PI will\r\nstudy some problems concerning the analytic study of\r\nautomorphic forms restricted to small subsets, especially\r\nperiod integrals.  Other components of the research include \r\nthe study of mean values of L-functions including the Riemann \r\nzeta function.\r\n\r\nOne of the goals of analytic number theory is to understand\r\nthe statistical properties of algebraic objects.  For instance,\r\none can ask what is the probability that a randomly chosen\r\nlarge number is a prime.  It is very fortunate for modern\r\ncryptography that it is easy to find large primes.  Cryptography\r\nis a crucial tool in banking, commerce, and of course national \r\nsecurity.  Some of our best knowledge on the prime numbers\r\ncomes from properties of the Riemann zeta function, the\r\nsimplest L-function.  Many other fascinating algebraic\r\nand geometric objects are encoded in other types of L-functions.\r\nThe PI plans to study many of the statistical properties of\r\nthese L-functions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\nThis project was focused on statistical  properties of L-functions, automorphic forms, and the connections between these two different types of objects.  Automorphic forms and L-functions encode  interesting information about the whole numbers 1,2,3, etc.  For  instance, the simplest L-function, the Riemann zeta function, helps mathematicians  to understand how the prime numbers are scattered amongst all the  positive numbers.  Prime numbers are important for modern cryptography which uses them  to encrypt and decrypt messages (such as credit card  numbers) for secure transmissions over the internet.  \n\nL-functions are a unifying force in mathematics, as they appear in many otherwise disparate areas.  For instance, they occur in algebraic number theory, quantum chaos, mathematical physics, geometry, as well as classical analytic number theory (their original point of origin).  Techniques developed to study one of these problems can then be applied to others.  Much of the research undertaken by the PI has been to discover new settings where the theory of L-functions may be successfully applied.\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts\nThe PI was involved in  a summer REU program in 2013 and 2014 at Texas A&amp;M University, which involved mentoring undergraduate students in number theory.  This program allowed undergraduates to participate in research in a meaningful way.  A large proportion of these REU students are members of underrepresented groups in mathematics, and/or come from universities with limited research opportunities.  The REU projects are intertwined with the PI's research program.\n\nThe PI also gave a cryptography mini-course to middle  school students at a summer enrichment program at Texas A&amp;M in 2012.  The PI  furthermore twice ran an activity at the Texas A&amp;M math circle in Spring 2013.  Mathematical Circles are a form of education enrichment and outreach  that bring students into direct contact with mathematical professionals  in an informal setting, to work on interesting problems or topics in  mathematics. The goal is to get the students excited about the  mathematics, giving them a setting that encourages them to become  passionate about mathematics.\n\nThe PI also partcipated at the Bryan Collegiate High School career day in May 2014.  Early college schools, such as Bryan Collegiate, are designed so that low-income youth, first-generation   college students, English language learners, students of color, and   other young people underrepresented in higher education can   simultaneously earn a high school diploma and one to two years of   transferable college credit tuition free.  The career day was an opportunity to connect high school students to some of the exciting aspects of college mathematics, such as cryptography.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew Young"
