 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northwest Indian College, the only accredited tribal college in the Pacific Northwest, has recently established an accredited B.S. in Native Environmental Science.  This S-STEM grant provides scholarship support for students enrolled in the new program, primarily Native Americans, to help these students qualify for graduate study and careers in environmental sciences.  The program is uniquely suited to the cultural norms of the students and the needs of Native American tribes.  It is in partnership with the community, including tribal natural resource departments, high-schools, and businesses, in recruiting and supporting the students.  Provision is made for students transferring from technical training at community colleges as well as for students needing time away from their studies for family or financial reasons.  Students completing this program will be well suited to serve the needs of the technical work force in their community or to seek graduate or professional education.",
