The research activities enabled by this instrument are expected to spotlight the need for adding the capabilities of parallel processing and reconfigurability offered by FPGA and DSP, as well as suggest important applications of the instruments in various areas of science. These areas include mathematics (number theory, fixed point mapping), computer science (data structures, algorithm analysis, computer architectures, and networking), and engineering. The instrument will service the following five projects: \r\n-\tFractal image compression, \r\n-\tCryptosystem with elliptic curve, \r\n-\tExperimental soft-tissue mechanics, \r\n-\tImage processing, and \r\n-\tDSP implementation for measuring ultrasonic waves.\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe acquisition of the platform will provide the faculty members from many disciplines a parallel platform including both DSPs and FPGAs, and expose cutting-edge computing to students. Students will be trained in the use of new and novel technologies that might impact an economically depressed area by providing a trained workforce. SVSU has good outreach to secondary school teachers and K-12.",
