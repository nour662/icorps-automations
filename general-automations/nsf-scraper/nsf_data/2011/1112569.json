 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Sarah Tolbert, Yves Rubin, and Benjamin Schwartz of the University of California at Los Angeles will develop methods for the solution-phase self-assembly of fullerene derivatives and conjugated polymers into films for organic solar cells.  The research has three complementary components.  In the first part, the research will focus on the use of molecular assembly in self-complementary fullerene derivatives to optimize network architecture for increased electron mobility.  In the second part, carrier mobility in the semiconducting polymer will be examined and optimized, this time using self-assembly of amphiphilic semiconducting polymers in aqueous solution. Finally, to facilitate the use of high mobility electron acceptors such as titania, fullerenes with surface binding groups will be prepared and the performance of solar cells incorporating nanostructured titania covered with fullerene monolayers will be studied. The broader impacts involve training graduate and undergraduate students, enhancing research infrastructure by bringing together a collaborative group, conducting high school teacher workshops on solar cells/solar energy, and the potential societal benefits of inexpensive organic photovoltaic devices.\r\n\r\nSolar cells made from electrically conducting plastics show great technological promise but have significant drawbacks in terms of low efficiencies and irreproducibility in processing.  This research seeks to solve some of those problems by enhancing our fundamental understanding of how to integrate various organic compounds to capture light and turn it into electrical energy.  The specific focus is to find robust ways to create nanometer sized structures that can efficiently generate electricity and then transport that electricity out of the solar cell for usage.  Through development of new chemical components and processing strategies, this research could lead to easier to produce and less expensive solar cell technologies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under this award has focused on new ways to create the structures needed for plastic solar cells that are both easier to produce and more robust than current methods.  Plastic solar cells offer the potential for ubiquitous, low cost solar energy harvesting.  The efficiency of these devices, however, depends in detail on the structure of the active material at very small length scales &ndash; all the way down to the nanometer length scale.  Through NSF support, we have developed a range of methods to control the nanometer scale architecture in these materials.  We have focused both on new ways to deposit the conductive plastics used in these devices and on new ways to control structure.  In a plastic (or polymer) solar cell, light is absorbed by a semiconducting polymer.  In order to convert that light energy to electricity, the electrons must be separated from the polymer, and this is usually done by transferring the electron to small molecule electron acceptor.  Derivatives of the 60-carbon ball called buckminsterfullerene or C60 are particularly good at accepting that electron.  The challenge is that the C60 derivatives (or fullerenes) must be close enough to every single polymer chain to efficiently accept electrons, but they also must form a continuous, electrically conductive network to let the electrons get out of the cell and generate current.  The solution is to create two intertwined nanometer scale networks, one made of polymer and one of fullerene (see figure, left).\n\nOur first main effort under NSF support has focused on new ways to create those networks.  In current plastic solar cells, the polymer and fullerene are deposited together and the network forms spontaneously &ndash; sometimes well and sometimes poorly.  In a new process we call sequential processing, we have shown that the polymer can first be deposited, and then the fullerene can be diffused into the network.  This creates very regular, interconnected nanometer scale polymer and fullerene networks that in turn produce very robust and reproducible plastic solar cells, without the need for reactive plasticizers that are used with traditional plastic solar cell fabrication.  In our other main effort, we turn to biology for inspiration and make water soluble semiconducting polymers and fullerenes that can self-assemble into well-defined structures as another way to make the desired nanometer scale networks.  The process of photosynthesis is highly efficiently because biology creates structures where an electron is pulled far away from a light absorbing molecule and then passed the along a string of waiting molecules.  Once the electron is far away, it cannot go back and so the electron can be used by the plant to do useful chemistry.  To mimic this behavior, we use self-assembly to create a polymer core consisting of fairly straight bundles of light absorbing polymer chains.  A few fullerenes nestle between the polymer chains, and then the outside of the bundle is surrounded by more fullerenes.  Electrons hop first from the polymer to the nearby fullerenes, and then in a second hop move to the fullerenes outside the polymer bundle (see figure, right).  In this way, the electron is pulled far away from the polymer, creating free electrons that are stable for day to weeks in a water solution.  Although this work was all done on polymer aggregates in water and is not yet a solar cell device, the insight gained from this work has real potential to improve efficiency in plastic solar cells.  Fundamentally, we have shown practical ways to keep electrons from going back to their polymers so that more electricity can be generated.\n\nThe success of this highly interdisciplinary work hinged on the synergistic combination of the skills that the three principle investigators brought to the effort.  Together our team had the expertise to synthesis novel self-assembling polymers and fullerene derivatives (Prof..."
