 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing and maintaining software is a key challenge in computer science,\r\nwith failures costing up to one half of one percent of the US GDP each\r\nyear. Most code is retained and evolved, rather than created from scratch,\r\nand professional software developers spend over three-fourths of their time\r\ntrying to understand existing code. Understandability and documentation\r\nhave become key components of software quality, yet they remain poorly\r\nunderstood by both researchers and practitioners. In a future where the\r\nsoftware engineering focus shifts from implementation to design and\r\ncomposition concerns, program understandability will become even more\r\nimportant. This research develops tools and techniques for mechanically\r\ngenerating documentation to help make programs easier to understand.\r\n\r\nThe research follows the insight that modern analysis techniques can form\r\nrich descriptive models of programs that are both precise and succinct.\r\nHuman-readable documentation can then be synthesized from such models.\r\nThe approach applies to large programs across multiple application domains.\r\nThe research focuses on documenting how code should be used correctly, a\r\ncritical aspect in an era of components-of-the-shelf development, as well\r\nas documenting how code has changed and evolved over time, a key\r\npart of software maintenance. The research leverages program analysis\r\ntechniques, machine learning, and textual synthesis, with results\r\ndisseminated through academic publication; the education, training and\r\nmentoring of students; as well as freely-available, open-source tools.",
