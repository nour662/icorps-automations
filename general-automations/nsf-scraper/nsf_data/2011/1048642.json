 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Robert Hamers and colleagues from the University of Wisconsin Madison will acquire a a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer.  The acquisition will advance research in areas of study such as (a) synthesis of bioactive substances, (b) synthesis and conformations of peptidic foldamers, (c) chemical synthesis of carbohydrate derivatives, (d) diazaphospholanes and catalytic asymmetric synthesis, (e) catalytic methods for selective aerobic oxidation of organic molecules, and (f) enantioselective C-H bond oxidation.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool used by chemists to identify unknown substances, to follow the progress of chemical reactions, to elucidate molecular structures, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solids and in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential for chemists who are carrying out frontier research and training students in modern research techniques. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry research at the University of Wisconsin.  It will be used to train students in undergraduate laboratory courses.  The instrument will be available to users at other undergraduate institutions in the Wisconsin system.",
