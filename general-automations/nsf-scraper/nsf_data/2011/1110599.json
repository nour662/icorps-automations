 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Matthew Sigman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah will explore the development of techniques to more efficiently optimize diverse enantioselective reactions.  Classically, catalyst optimization has remained mainly empirical, wherein evaluation of a significant number of ligands, often structurally unrelated, is required to develop a mature chiral catalyst.  To overcome this impediment, Professor Sigman will use modular ligands, which permit the introduction of systematic changes to the ligand structure, in combination with physical organic mechanistic tools (i.e., Hammett electronic parameters and Charton/Taft steric parameters) and design of experimental statistical approaches to facilitate catalyst design and optimization.  \r\n\t\t\r\nThis work could lead to both new enantioselective catalysts for challenging, synthetically useful transformations and the development of new approaches for mechanistic analysis and catalyst optimization.   Success in each of these areas will have an impact on any area of activity in which the synthesis of molecules and catalyst optimization is needed, such as the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industries and their biological and chemical research activities.  In addition, this project will provide training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n         A central goal of modern organic chemistry is to develop robust and sustainable catalytic reactions that functionalize a molecule with high levels of selectivity.  The major issue in the development of such processes is the highly empirical nature of the procedure.  Many test reactions are required but only a few are fruitful in improving a reaction.  As chemical processes become more sophisticated (e.g., requiring many ingredients), the desire to streamline the optimization and thus save precious time and resources is significant.  Therefore, our program has sought to develop an alternative strategy by which we describe molecules with various mathematical representations and compare these with the outcomes elicited by the molecule in a given reaction.  Comparing these two quantitative outputs allows one to potentially derive mathematical models. Evaluating the parameters required to achieve statistically stringent mathematical models leads two different but useful consequences: 1) mathematical prediction of entirely new reaction results and 2) a deeper fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism.  By combining the insight from these disparate goals, one can design and develop altogether new combinations of reactants and catalysts to result in a much more robust and beneficial chemical process.  Specifically, in the last granting period, we reported the development of several new molecular descriptor sets, the application of these to the prediction and understanding of a diverse array of reactions, and, maybe of most importance, the initiation of numerous collaborations both in the academic and industrial realms.  While reporting new methods to streamline reaction development is a clear broader impact, the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the expansive areas (organic synthesis, mathematical modeling, and physical organic chemistry) is the defining broader impact of this program.\n\n \n   \n\n \n \n\n \n \n         A central goal of modern organic chemistry is to develop robust and sustainable catalytic reactions that functionalize a molecule with high levels of selectivity.
