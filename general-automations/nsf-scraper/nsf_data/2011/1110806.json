 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rats are arguably the most destructive invasive species on the planet, carrying pathogens that have been responsible some of the most devastating epidemics in human history. Through their close relationship with humans, rats have spread to every continent and can reach high numbers in densely populated urban areas, making them effective vectors for the spread of infectious disease. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections have been detected at a high frequency in humans from urban areas in the US, but the transmission pathways traditionally thought to be responsible for HEV spread (oral-fecal transmission or swine-human contact) are not present. Invasive rats have been shown to have high HEV infection rates in the U.S. (>40%) and are competent hosts of human HEV. In the proposed work, invasive rats collected from across the US will be examined for HEV infection to determine the infection rate and the rate with which rats are spreading HEV.\r\n\r\nThis research has important public health implications. The mortality rate of HEV infection ranges from 1-4% in the general public, but is as high as 20% in pregnant women. In addition, HEV is the only hepatitis virus known to have animal reservoirs. Yet no study has examined invasive rats as reservoirs for spreading HEV to humans. This project will provide the first data concerning the spread of HEV by rats, providing valuable information to manage the spread of HEV infections. Additionally, several undergraduates, including Native American students, will assist in the research.",
