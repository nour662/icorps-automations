 "awd_abstract_narration": "River incision into bedrock sets the pace of landscape evolution in most settings and is the mechanism by which tectonic signals are communicated to the landscape.  Consequently, a mechanistic understanding of river incision is important for many practical problems (e.g., river restoration, habitat stability) as well as for addressing intellectual questions such as how will a landscape respond to an increase in tectonic uplift rate or annual precipitation?  In the past decade, recognition of the importance of bedrock river incision has led to an explosion of research on this topic, and substantial progress has been made in understanding river incision processes.  However, most efforts have treated rivers one-dimensionally.  Hence, how a river erodes laterally in a valley is largely unknown. Consequently, features such as bedrock (strath) terraces, which illustrate the alternating dominance of lateral and vertical incision over geologic time-scales, remain enigmatic.  A deeper understanding of how bedrock terraces form would illuminate lateral erosion mechanics and would help answer a century-old question in Geomorphology, how and why do rivers form terraces in bedrock?  This project, which combines numerical modeling, analysis of high resolution topographic data, and field work focused on the Smith River in Oregon and on the Pescadero Creek watershed in California, will test hypotheses related to how and why rivers move laterally across bedrock, and the consequences of this for where and when terraces form.\r\n\r\nBroader Significance: Through better understanding of processes of lateral bedrock erosion, we can test the plausibility that bedrock rivers might record climatic or tectonic events when they create terraces.  This is of fundamental scientific value because the record rivers leave in the landscape is one of the few direct clues that we have to understand how landscapes respond to shifting climates.  This research will also foster invaluable scientific training for a PhD student, an undergraduate research assistant, and an entire undergraduate geology class that will be involved in field-testing the hypotheses articulated in the proposal.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe origins of meandering bedrock canyons have been debated for over a century among geologists.  Indeed, many introductory geology textbooks contain a familiar diagram explaining how sinuous canyons arise after the cookie-cutter inheritance of a sinuous form from an ancestral meandering river.  This popular idea notwithstanding, there is in fact abundant evidence for active meandering in many bedrock canyons around the world.  However, to date there has been no mechanistic understanding for how a meandering channel can sweep laterally through hard bedrock.  Consequently, we lack a basic framework for interpreting the history etched into river canyons around the world.\n\nIn the first part of this project, we undertook field and laboratory work in order to answer the basic question of how a bedrock channel meanders by comparing erosional processes in two adjacent rivers in coastal California, one of which meanders, the other of which is straight.  We discovered that disintegration of rock from wetting and drying (\"slaking\") allows for bedrock meandering in two fundamental ways. First, by rapidly disaggregating coarse sediment that is deposited in the channel, slaking prevents the buildup of debris in the channel due to steepening of hillslopes adjacent to the meandering channel.  This material would otherwise armor the bank and prevent further lateral erosion. Second, at riverbanks where scour of soil and vegetation exposes bare bedrock to drying, slaking weakens a layer of bank rock to the point where it can be eroded easily by the river. In these ways, slaking enables erosion into bedrock banks in response to meandering, as in alluvial rivers. \n\nIn the second part of this project, we explored the consequences of meandering on river catchment evolution through analysis of digital topographic data for a meandering bedrock channel in the Oregon Coast Range.  Large meander bends can sweep 100\u00c6s or even 1000\u00c6s of meters into adjacent hillslopes.  This process forces constant reorganization of the landscape in sudden and surprising ways.  Specifically, we identify two processes along the Smith River in Oregon that dramatically and instantaneously impact tributary channels: 1) Capture of tributaries by growing meander bends, and 2) Meander bend cutoffs (analogous to an oxbow lake formation in an alluvial river) on the main-stem that leave tributaries disconnected from the trunk stream in a canyon. Topographic constraints from LiDAR data suggest that the timescale of adjustment for tributaries following cutoff events is ~ 105-106 years. The timescale of adjustment of tributary channels following meander cutoff events is therefore comparable to or in excess of the time-scale of Pleistocene climate and sea-level variability. Our results demonstrate that tributaries connected to rivers with active bedrock meanders are likely to be much more influenced by the process of meandering itself than by, for example, tectonic, sea-level or climatic forcing.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nEducational\n\nThis project supported two graduate students, an MS student and a female PhD student, at UC Santa Cruz. \n\nOutreach\n\nThe PhD student supported on this project taught an undergraduate geomorphology class at UC Santa Cruz during the project.
