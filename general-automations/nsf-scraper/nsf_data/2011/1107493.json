For example, wondering about the outcome may be a particular event that occurs and these thoughts may happen more persistently when one tries not to think about their test score. However, being preoccupied with thinking about an event can have effects on one&rsquo;s productivity and well-being. Thus, philosophers and researchers have been long been interested in what happens when one inhibits thoughts and feelings. These ideas have spawned an area of research on the effects of thought and emotional suppression. Thought suppression is the act of deliberately trying not to think about something (Wegner et al., 1987). Common sense may lead one to believe that inhibiting unwanted thoughts regarding a negative event will lessen the effects or help them disappear. However, research has shown that &ldquo;trying not to think about something&rdquo; may be particularly difficult and create paradoxical effects. For example, many theorists have suggested that suppressing thoughts results in a rebound effect, such that suppression will make these thoughts and feelings stronger and more frequent and more accessible. Theorists have agreed that trying to avoid stressful thoughts can lead to intrusions of the thought (Horowitz, 1975) and experimental studies have shown this effect (e.g., Wegner, Schneider, Carter, &amp; White, 1987). Since the seminal study conducted by Wegner and colleagues (1987), many studies have replicated this effect.

In Western or individualistic culture, people are encouraged to promote and maintain their distinctiveness and act according to their own volitions. In contrast, individuals in collectivistic cultures are encouraged to focus on their relationships and maintain harmony in their social relationships. In general, North Americans and Western Europeans follow individualistic culture whereas East Asians have adopted collectivistic culture (Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 1989).
