 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for research that will enable the manufacture of supramolecular synthetic alloys which will actively function as energy absorbent materials. Supramolecular alloys are a co-assembly of two or more functional molecules.  Regulation of the co-assembly can afford the final alloys unique structural and mechanical properties. Planned experiments include the investigation of the intercalation (insertion) of small molecules to reconfigure the supramolecules for the desired properties. The evaluation of the mechanical response of the resulting materials to external energy input (load and heat) will also be performed.  Molecular dynamics modeling will be used to reveal the influence of structure and interface parameters on energy absorption thus enabling material design. The project will focus on the fine-tuning of the 2D structures, regulating the interactions among the building blocks, as well as the accurate probing of the associated microscopic deformation mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will lead to an in-depth understanding of the mechanical properties of highly ordered polymers or supramolecules. These materials could be used either as a stand-alone thin coating for structure/performance protection against dynamic loads or as an interface toughness/strength promoter in conventional polymer composites. In addition, design and manufacturing of a lightweight counterpart to metal alloys is advantageous to aerodynamic structures and polymer composites having stringent weight or processing requirements.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLarge surface to volume ratio from nanostructures provide new opportunities in materials design and processing.  This completed award explored two frontiers in this direction, by designing a nanostructured supramolecular alloy to dissipate dynamic impact or implanting a water-rich medium with nanoparticle-trees to sense a soft impact.  High energy absorption coefficiency from the first application is benefitial to civil and military protections; high efficiency in converting mechanical signal to electric signal from the second application, on the other hand, leads opportunities for underwater acoustic wave detection.\n\nThe first exploration uses a mixed batch of small molecules tethered with silane functional groups.  When the mixture was allowed to assemble in a dilute solution, the molecules organized themselves into two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular alloys (called nanoflakes).  Among the interfaces of these nanoflakes, a slightly roughened surface leads to large sliding barriers that furhter act as the mechanism for energy absorption.  We show performance of resulting material after such a nanostructured design is outstanding, where the specific energy absorption efficiency (energy dissipated per unit mass) is 275 J/g (twice as the best performance from the state-of-the art in Al(001) and 4 times that of nylon composite).\n\nThe second exploration works with hydrogels that are mostly composed of water.  Due to its soft nature (identical bulk modulus and mass density as water), hydrogel is an ideal medium for the reception of sound in water, where negligible reflection occurs at the interface.  However, previously no method exists to convert the mechanical vibrations in hydrogel body into electrical signal and hydrogle acoustic sensor does not exist.  Our work showed, for the first time, made this a reality, by implanting metallic nanoparticle-trees in hydrogel block.  Underwater sound easily penetrated this water-based medium, deformed the trees, and then generated a huge amount of ionic charge / discharge current.  Major promises of this new material system include the following: (1) it shares perfect acoustic impedance with oceanic background, leading to high potentials for deep ocean communications using acoustic waves; (2) it has much higher signal strength toward low frequency acoustic waves than conventional hydrophone; (3) it contains no moveable part and has a small footprint in design; (4) it needs less than 1 V DC bias in operation and draws extensively small amount of power (micro Watts).\n\nThe operation of this award involved 4 graduate students at the Ph.D. level and 2 postdocortal researchers.  Outreach efforts include 8-week education of three underrepresented or minority undergraduate students.
