 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Collaboration and Guided Inquiry in the Organic Chemistry Laboratory (CGIOChem) project is renewing the organic chemistry laboratory by creating, testing, and assessing organic chemistry laboratory investigations that emphasize both structured collaboration and guided inquiry. In these laboratory investigations, partially based upon combinatorial methods used in pharmaceutical research, students work both as individuals and as a team. Individually, students investigate different but related reactions or analyze or synthesize different but related molecules. After participating in guided, small group discussion of their individual results, students work as a team on an inquiry challenge applying their knowledge from individual investigations. The laboratory materials are being developed, micro-tested, revised, and tested in both small organic laboratory courses and large multi-section organic chemistry laboratory sessions, in both four-year university and two-year college environments. The intellectual merit of CGIOChem emerges from ample evidence that student-centered pedagogies such as inquiry and collaboration enhance student achievement in and engagement with science and help them progress from novices to researchers. CGIOChem is evaluating how laboratory materials based on these pedagogies specifically impact organic chemistry students. The materials developed may be applicable to various organic chemistry course settings including the spiral organic course it is initially complementing. Evaluation by an independent organic chemist evaluator assesses student understanding and achievement in organic chemistry and also student engagement with organic chemistry and fellow learners. The broader impacts include how collaboration and guided inquiry enhance Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) retention and STEM degree completion.",
