 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports team of researchers to investigate the hypothesis that aridification in Northern Africa and cooling in the North Atlantic Ocean, associated with Heinrich events, are recorded in the chemical composition of stalagmites from the Bahamas during periods of low sea level.\r\n\r\nThe team's science strategy is to combine geochemical analysis of speleothems with regional modeling in order to gain a better understanding of the signatures and physical mechanisms of rapid climate change in the tropical/sub-tropical Atlantic. The Bahamian stalagmites occur in caves which are now flooded by seawater. The researchers have collected submerged samples from depths up to 35 meters below the present sea level. \r\n\r\nThese stalagmites formed during periods when sea-level was lower than the present time and ceased growing either when sea-level flooded the caves or when climate conditions became arid and there ceased to be sufficient water to support speleothem formation. The speleothems have been preliminarily dated and separated into three age groups of 14,000-80,000 yrs, 200,000-250,000 yrs, and 300,000-350,000 yrs.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include outreach activities in the Bahamas, where the researchers will work with local environmental organizations to raise awareness of the effects of sea-level rise.  The project also includes support for two graduate students and opportunities for undergraduate students and high school interns to obtain laboratory and research experience.",
