 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are utilizing multiple disciplines in the Earth Sciences to better understand processes associated with the subduction of oceanic ridges at convergent plate boundaries. In particular, we are studying a well-preserved example of ancient ridge subduction in the Pacific Northwest, where we have an unprecedented opportunity to document a 20 million year history of ridge subduction phenomena from development of sedimentary basins to magmatism and metamorphism in the middle crust. This ancient example thus offers a critical compliment to studies of modern ridge subduction systems where deeper processes must be evaluated indirectly. We are testing a model of the changing position of the ridge from approximately 60 to 40 million years ago, a period that marks the transition from the Mesozoic North Cascades arc to modern Cascadia.  We are also addressing several central questions for ridge subduction. 1) How do fore-arc sedimentary basins respond to changes in stresses and strains that accompany ridge subduction and jumps in the positions of oceanic ridges? 2) How is deformation, such as faulting, partitioned in space and time across the continental margin during ridge subduction? 3) What are the diagnostic geochemical features of magmas within a convergent margin after ridge subduction. As part of our research, we are using a geographic information system to reconstruct the distribution of geological features during the interval of 60-40 million years. We are making the digital paleotectonic and paleogeographic maps and data derived from this study available to other researchers and educators in order to allow others to build upon and supplement our efforts. In summary, this multidisciplinary collaborative research should provide significant contributions to understanding of processes associated with ridge subduction, a fundamental  plate tectonic process, and the effects of ridge subduction on the Eocene tectonic evolution of the Pacific Northwest. Our project involves a collaboration between several universities of diverse character, including San Jose State University, University of Puget Sound, Northern Arizona University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Involvement of graduate and undergraduate students is a critical component of this project. Several undergraduate students are participating in the research. Their involvement includes participating in the geologic fieldwork, conducting individual research projects, traveling to other universities to use analytical facilities not available at their home institutions, and the preparation of undergraduate theses based on their research. The results are of the research are also being integrated in geologic classroom curricula as part of an advanced undergraduate course at the University of Puget Sound where students are studying the rocks collected during this study as part of a semester-long class project. Results of the research are being disseminated at professional society meetings (including student presentations on their research) and the peer-reviewed scientific literature.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe early Eocene (~52 - 43 Ma) was a time of unusually widespread magmatism and tectonic activity in the Pacifc Northwest.  Compositionally diverse volcanism occurred as far inland as Montana, crustal extension produced dike swarms and subsiding basins, crustal uplift and erosion deposited thick sediment accumulations along the continental margin, and the oceanic Siletzia Terrane was accreted to the edge of the continent.  The goal of this project has been to understand the tectonic process(es) responsible for this activity, and in particular to evaluate the importance of ridge subduction and/or rollback and breakoff of the Farallon slab. \n\nOur approach has been to combine igneous petrology with high precision U-Pb geochronology to identify magma sources and space-time patterns in ignous activity.  Four sites were chosen for study: the 48 Ma Basalt of Summit Creek (BSC, representing magmatism in the Eocene forearc), the 49 Ma Golden Horn batholith (GHB) and 49 Ma Teanaway Basalt (TB, representing magmatism in the Eocene arc), and a suite of 55-46 Ma plutons and dikes in eastern Washington (representing magmatism in the Eocene backarc).\n\nLavas of the BSC are chemically and isotopically indistinguishable from oceanic basalts of the Crescent Formation, located ~100 km to the west.  Eruption of oceanic basalts in an arc setting requires a mechanism for ascending magmas to pass through the subducting plate, and is compatible with either a slab window or a slab breakoff model.\n\nThe GHB is unique among Tertiary granites of the PNW because it displays \"A-type\" chemical affinities and was emplaced is an unusually short span of time (~750 ka).  These features can be explained by intrusion of voluminous mafic magmas that drove melting of intermediate composition plutonic rocks (e.g., tonalites) at mid-crustal depths.  The existence of mafic magmas during batholith formation is documented by coeval mafic dikes and by the nearby Skymo Complex, a mid-crustal layered mafic intrusion. The unusual \"A-type\" chemistry of the GHB thus reflects extensional conditions (allowing basalts to intrude the mid-crust) and high magma production in the mantle.\n\nU-Pb zircon dating of 13 Eocene plutons from eastern Washingon reveals a younger-to-the-southwest age progression between 52 - 45 Ma that is compatible with slab rollback.  Conversely, based on our knowledge of Eoccene plate motions, migration of a slab window should have produced a younger-to-the-northwest age progression.  The beginning of this age progression (52 Ma) corresponds to an increase in igneous activity in eastern Washington and shortly precedes the accretion of Siletzia.  Combining our petrologic and age data, we have developed the following model for Eocene magmatism and tectonism:\n\n(1) As Siletzia approached the continental margin at ~52 Ma subduction slowed, leading to rollback of the shallowly-dipping Farallon slab.  Hot asthenosphere rising around/through the foundering slab caused melting and uplift of the overling crust, resulting in volcanism and extension across eastern and central WA.\n\n(2) Following accretion of Siletzia (~50 Ma) subduction was terminated, leading to breakoff of the Farallon slab.  This produced a belt of igneous activity in western WA (~48 - 44 Ma) above the zone of rupture, which includes the BSC as well as adakites, S-type granites, and bimodal volcanics.\n\n(3) At ~43 Ma subduction resumed, with a new trench west of Siletzia (now the Coast Range mountains), and this marks the inception of the modern Cascade arc.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey H Tepper"
