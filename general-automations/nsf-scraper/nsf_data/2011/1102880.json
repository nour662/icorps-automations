Specifically, the researchers aim to evaluate the relative roles of emissions and atmospheric dynamics in the variability of oxidants on glacial-interglacial timescales as well as any regional variation in sulfate and nitrate isotopes.\r\n\r\nThe award will support two graduate students and a high school science teacher.  Successful completion of the work would improve the understanding of feedbacks between climate and the sources and sinks of methane, which would help improve our understanding of climate.",

Our work has enhanced understanding of the trends in oxidation capacity of the atmosphere over time (Alexander and Mickley, 2015).
