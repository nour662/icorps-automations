The conference will be held in Vienna, Austria, July 17-13, 2011.  The conference will hold thematic sessions for invited presentations, tutorial programs on related subjects, and special interest group workshops.  Biological areas presented at the conference will include bio-imaging and visualization, databases and ontologies, evolution and comparative genomics, gene regulation and transcriptomics, mass spectrometry and proteomics, population genomics, protein interaction, and molecular networks and structure.  \r\n\r\nResults will be disseminated as published proceedings indexed in MEDLINE and Current Contents, and video recordings of selected presentations will be available online. This award will support participation of US students and under-represented minorities in an important forum for presenting research and ideas at the intersection of biology and computer science.",
