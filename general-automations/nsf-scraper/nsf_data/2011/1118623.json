 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to use mathematical models to gain insight into the evolutionary causes and ecological effects of the dispersal of organisms.  The individual behavior of dispersing organisms influences the spatial distribution of their population, which influences their ecological interactions with resources, predators, and members of their own species.  Those interactions in turn influence the survival of individuals and populations, and hence create selective advantages for individuals with superior dispersal strategies.   Selection results in evolutionary pressure on the dispersal behavior of individuals.  Mathematical models are used to understand and describe the complex feedbacks at multiple scales involved in the ecology and evolution of dispersal behavior.  The primary modeling approach is based on systems of reaction-advection-diffusion equations with variable and/or density dependent coefficients.  Such equations can be derived from the movement mechanisms used by individuals, but they also make predictions about species interactions and evolution.  Thus, they provide a framework for addressing complex interactions across different spatial and temporal scales and different levels of organization.  They present significant mathematical challenges but recent advances in bifurcation theory and partial differential equations will facilitate their analysis.  The analysis also employs ideas from the theory of dynamical systems.  Patch models and integrodifferential equations with nonlocal dispersal are used in addition to partial differential equations.  Many of the analytic approaches that work for reaction-diffusion-advection models can be applied to them, leading to conceptual unification.  Traditional dispersal models typically view dispersal as an essentially random process that does not depend on environmental conditions or the internal states of individuals, but there have been numerous studies suggesting that conditional dispersal is common and may be advantageous.  Thus, the research focuses on models where the diffusion and advection rates of individuals depend on environmental conditions and/or the population densities of their species and species with which they interact.   That leads to new mathematical research on questions involving the dynamics and equilibria of nonlinear systems of parabolic partial differential equations with coefficients that vary in space and/or time.\r\n\r\nThe dispersal of organisms influences the persistence and interactions of populations and drives range expansions, biological invasions, and the colonization of empty habitats.   Thus, understanding dispersal is relevant to addressing questions about biological conservation, invasive species, pest control, and other environmental issues, including the response of populations to global change.  The ways that the dispersal patterns of organisms affect their interactions with the environment and with other species are complex and subtle, so it is difficult to assess the effects of variations in dispersal patterns on those interactions.  Also, since dispersal affects survival and thus leads to natural selection, evolution may change the dispersal strategies of organisms inhabiting changing environments. That process involves complex feedback loops which are difficult to understand.  The research addresses those problems by using mathematical models to describe the ecological effects and evolution of dispersal.   The models are based on partial differential equations, which provide a framework for describing how quantities change and influence each other over space and time.  Specifically, the models include terms describing random movements, directed movements, and ecological interactions that may vary in time and space and/or depend on population densities.  The research provides new information about the ways that these processes interact.  Traditional models for dispersal usually describe it as a random process that does not depend on location or environmental conditions, so this research involves the development and analysis of new types of models that may be relevant in studying various phenomena in ecology and related areas.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit : The general goal of this project was to use mathematical models to gain insight into the effects of population dispersal in ecology, and into the types of dispersal that are most likely to evolve in response to given environmental conditions.  A specific focus of the project was the question of what types of dispersal strategies would evolve for a single population inhabiting an environment that varied in space but was static in time.  We believe that our work on this project, together with related work by other researchers, has largely answered that question.  To frame the issue mathematically, we used the idea of evolutionary stability.  That idea, which was originally developed by biologists and motivated by ideas from game theory, is to view dispersal behavior as a strategy, and to ask if there is any strategy a population can use that will allow it to resist invasion by any small population of mutants using any other strategy.  If there is such a strategy, that strategy could be expected to persist under the processes of mutation and selection.  Such strategies are called evolutionarily stable.  In our work, strategies might be described, for example,  by parameters giving the rates of random movement versus directed movement up resource gradients, and the success or failure of invasions would be determined by a pair of equations modeling the dispersal of the resident and invading populations and the competition between them.  What we found was that in a wide range of different types of models, there were strategies that were evolutionarily stable, and those were the ones that allowed populations to exactly match the availability of resources and thus achieve what ecologists call an ideal free distribution, where all individuals have equal fitness and there is no net movement of individuals.  We also found that there are ways that populations can match resource densities globally across a landscape by using only local environmental information in deciding how to move.  Finally, we found that in several modeling contexts the strategies that can produce an ideal free distribution can be characterized by an abstract mathematical property originally defined for square matrices (that is, arrays of numbers with the same number of rows as columns) known as line sum symmetry.  Thus, we were able to give a mathematical characterization of the types of dispersal that could be expected to evolve and persist in certain types of environments, which we believe provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of dispersal .  On the mathematical side, that research involved the use of matrix theory and the theory of ordinary and partial differential equations, among other things, and led us to new mathematical results.\n\n     In a different direction, we collaborated with ecologists in constructing and analyzing models for the effects of phenology, which refers to the timing of events such as the emergence of animals from hibernation, or the opening of flowers or germination of seeds.  It seems clear that a mismatch between, say, the timing of the opening of flowers and the arrival or emergence of pollinators might be problematic for both, but models are needed to quantify the extent and details of such effects.  We think that the modeling approach we and our collaborators developed can be applied to various situations where matching phenologies is important. \n\nBroader Impacts :   Cosner  had a Ph.D. student  who wrote a dissertation related to dispersal models that was partly motivated by this project.  The results on quantification of the effects of phenology shifts could help us understand what to expect if global change causes the times of emergence of different species to shift different amounts, which is likely in some systems.  A considerable amount of our research on that topic was conducted in collaboration with postdocs in ecology and contributed to their training.  Our purely scientific research in this pr..."
