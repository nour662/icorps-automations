 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will investigate the merits and\r\nfeasibility of an Adaptive Compact Fuel Reformer (ACFR) using an Ultra-Fine Homogeneous\r\nAtomizer based on an autothermal process. Diesel reformer is the key to provide syngas (H2+CO) for\r\nfuel cell auxiliary power unit (APU) which can significantly reduce engine idling fuel cost. Hydrogen\r\nrich syngas with EGR is effective for simultaneously reducing engine NOx and PM emissions.\r\nHowever, most diesel reformers face challenges of auto-ignition control, coking and fuel slip, size\r\nand weight reduction, and durability issues, etc. The key innovation of the adaptive compact fuel\r\nreformer is an ultra-fine atomizer, which has an innovative micro-circular orifice coupling ultra-thin\r\nlayer of fuel spray, steam and air flow simultaneously. The atomizer can produce very small fuel\r\ndroplets (~10 micron) and homogenous mixture, which can be quickly vaporized and converted into\r\nsyngas in a small space without auto-ignition, coking and slip. The Phase I work will complete the\r\nkey design work for the fuel reformer and conduct lab bench scale testing for key components.\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are significant potential benefits for US\r\nenergy security and environment protection. The potential customers include engine OEMs and auto\r\nmakers. The industry-university collaborated research will help graduate students carry on\r\nfundamental research while providing deeper understanding of diesel fuel reformation for commercial\r\napplications.",
