This will be done from the\r\nperspective of a program developed jointly with B. Siebert, which\r\n\"tropicalizes\" Calabi-Yau manifolds, using an algebro-geometric\r\nversion of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture.  In particular,\r\nthe principal investigator proposes to resolve a number of the\r\nremaining key steps of this program; these steps should be the\r\ncomponent pieces of a complete conceptual proof of mirror\r\nsymmetry at genus zero. These steps include a general gluing\r\nformula for the theory of logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants\r\nand a generalization of the tropical vertex of the PI,\r\nPandharipande and Siebert to all dimensions. In addition, the\r\nprogram with Siebert has led to the construction of canonical\r\ntheta functions for lines bundles on (degenerating families) of\r\nCalabi-Yau manifolds. The existence of such theta functions is\r\nexpected to have various applications, such as geometric\r\ncompactifications of the moduli space of K3 surfaces (being\r\npursued with P. Hacking and S. Keel) and a tropical approach to\r\nhomological mirror symmetry (being pursued with Siebert and\r\nM. Abouzaid).\r\n\r\nThe work described in this proposal lies at the intersection of\r\nstring theory and geometry. String theory replaces the\r\ntraditional notion of the point particle with a small loop of\r\nstring, moving through space-time.  To make string theory\r\ncompatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must be\r\nten-dimensional. Since space-time appears four-dimensional, one\r\nexpects six of these dimensions to be a very small \"curled up\"\r\ngeometric object.  These geometric objects are called Calabi-Yau\r\nmanifolds. In the early 1990s, string theorists proposed a\r\nremarkable association between completely different Calabi-Yau\r\nmanifolds: certain calculations extremely difficult to perform on\r\none Calabi-Yau manifold could be completed by performing\r\ncompletely different, and much easier, calculations on a\r\ndifferent Calabi-Yau manifold. This discovery was known as mirror\r\nsymmetry.  Since this time, many geometers have been trying to\r\nunderstand the mathematics behind this miraculous\r\nobservation. New insights and explanations for this phenomenon\r\nare developing rapidly, and these insights are leading to new\r\napproaches to old problems in algebraic geometry. The proposed\r\nwork aims to both further understanding of mirror symmetry and\r\napply this understanding to produce new developments in algebraic\r\ngeometry.",
