 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal provides funding to support travel expenses for a group of U.S. students to attend the annual FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC Data Users and Science Workshop in Taiwan. In a successful international collaboration involving primarily Taiwan and the U.S., a global system of GPS satellites has been launched, and the data from them is used to support global weather prediction, climate monitoring, and space weather forecasting. Numerous international agencies make use of data from these satellites, and the users meet each year to discuss their work. On this occasion there will also be a student conference for students to present their work and to meet counterparts from other countries. Up to eleven students from across the U.S. will be supported for the trip, and those will be recruited by wide publication of the opportunity to participate.\r\n\r\nThe workshop as well as the student conference will include research presentations and workshop discussions on the data obtained from the satellites and the way it is being analyzed to improve weather forecasting. Sharing of this information among participants from a number of countries will promote progress in the field and enable the resolution of ever-more challenging atmospheric problems. The capability provided by the satellites and the data that they yield has significant social benefit by improving weather forecasting capabilities. The Radio Occultation method used here is not yet well known so exposure to the workshops should help to publicize the tool. Participation in the meetings, technical tours and workshops by eleven U.S. students will contribute to their professional development and establish productive relationships with colleagues, particularly in East Asia.",
