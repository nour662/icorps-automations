 "awd_abstract_narration": "The necessary science and technology are developed to demonstrate sustained dynamic soaring of an unmanned aerial vehicle. This has four primary components.  First, the team develops novel, real-time solutions specific to the dynamic soaring motion planning problem to enable perpetual flight.  Second, they develop compact representations for estimating wind field in real time.  These measurements serve as input to the motion planner to optimize energy that is recovered from a given soaring cycle.  Third, they develop a novel airframe whose design is tightly coupled with motion planning algorithm development.  Finally, a significant technical evaluation is performed which culminates in a demonstration of sustained low-altitude dynamic soaring.\r\n\r\nThe realization of unmanned aerial vehicles capable of staying aloft is transformative for many fields, e.g., as a low altitude and cost alternative to conventional satellite systems.  Such pseudo-satellites serve as a sensor network and provide surveillance data, weather monitoring, and act as relay nodes in telecommunications networks.  They are put into place, recovered, and maintained without the significant expense and failure risk associated with a space launch.  A dynamically soaring unmanned aerial vehicle is ideal for hurricane observation since the craft is designed with the required strength and the associated wind gradients provide sufficient aircraft endurance for the life of the storm.  One major outreach effort is the Robotics and Aerospace Camp for a group of 20-30 eighth and ninth grade students; this is part of a year round academy to promote academic achievement and college  placement for economically and academically challenged middle level and high school students.",
