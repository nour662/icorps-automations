 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the LHC Theory Initiative, a competitive national fellowship program supporting the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in theoretical particle physics.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly twenty years of planning and construction, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is now the highest-energy particle collider in the world.  Data from the LHC is likely to lead to nothing less than a new \"Standard Model\" of particle physics, describing the building blocks of matter and their interactions at an even higher energy scale.   This award will fund competitive graduate student and postdoctoral fellowships aimed at young theorists intent on interpreting the LHC data.  Theoretical analysis provides an essential complement to the LHC experimental program, and this award will help ensure that the United States has the young theorists it needs to gain full benefit from the investment it had made in the LHC experimental facility.\r\n\r\nThis project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  In particular, it will train leaders of the next generation in this fundamental field of physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the pre-eminent facility in the field of elementary particle physics.  Located in a 27-km ring outside Geneva, Switzerland, LHC experiments are at the forefront of discovery.  Indeed, the Higgs Boson was discovered there in 2013, leading to the Nobel Prize in physics that year.\nCritical to the success of the LHC is the ability to discriminate discovery-class signals from garden-variety backgrounds.  New techniques are needed to separate needles from the haystack.  This award assured that the next generation of US particle theorists is up to the task.  In particular, it supported 26 students and postdocs across 20 institutions from Massachusetts to California, Wisconsin to Florida, as they developed their skills and deepened their training in LHC-oriented theory. \nThe LHC Theory Initiative fellows were instrumental in developing the sophisticated jet analysis techniques now used by the LHC experiment.  But beyond that, through a series of workshops, they formed a community ready and able to work with the LHC experimenters to achieve their common goals. \nThe LHC was and is a strategic priority of the NSF, and this award helped assure that the United States received full value from its substantial investment.  It also supplied a cadre of students and postdocs with skills that have direct impact in the private sector.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan A Bagger"
