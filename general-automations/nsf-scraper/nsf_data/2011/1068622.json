 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the inaugural meeting of the Southeast Neuroscience Consortium\r\n(SENC). This organization was created by the merger of the Southeast Nerve Net (SENN)\r\n(founded in 1983) and the Georgia South Carolina Neuroscience Consortium (GA/SC-NC) Since\r\nits inception, the focus of SENN meetings has been comparative neuroscience while that of the\r\nGASCNC has been systems neuroscience. Thus, meetings of the SENC will encompass the\r\nspectrum of modern neuroscience.\r\nThe primary goals of meetings of the SENC will be to provide a forum for students and\r\nearly postdocs to give talks in a supportive environment where they get exposure to a large\r\naudience and, at the same time, allow neuroscientists from across the South East to come\r\ntogether. The majority if not all oral sessions will be set aside for students, thereby providing\r\nthem a rare opportunity to fine tune their speaking skills before encountering the more\r\nimpersonal audiences they would likely encounter at large national (i.e. Society for\r\nNeuroscience) or international meetings. To facilitate student participation, a significant portion\r\nof the award will be assigned to cover the travel costs of student participants. A major effort will\r\nbe made to attract students from two year colleges, where neuroscience is typically poorly\r\nrepresented, and Historically Black Colleges and other minority institutions.\r\nAll told, we expect this meeting will enhance student training, enhance collabora",
