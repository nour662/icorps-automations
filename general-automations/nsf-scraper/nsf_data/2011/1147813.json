 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the emergence of ever increasing diversified applications provided by the smart devices such as smart phones, traditional telecommunications systems such as the wireless cellular systems no longer meet the ever exploding traffic demand, and cannot effectively deal with the shortage of available spectrum or congestion over wireless systems. On the other hand, tremendous temporal and spatial network resources, such as spectrum and computational capability, are severely under-utilized. Obviously, how to proactively harvest such residual resources and utilize them opportunistically to support diversified user traffic is an important yet challenging research direction. Although cognitive radio networks are to address this pressing issue, there is lack of viable network architecture in taking full advantage of the opportunistic spectrum access and there exist many practical design issues to be resolved. In this project, the PIs propose a flexible Cognitive Capacity Harvesting (CCH) network architecture to intelligently harvest network resources in both time and space and develop the corresponding technologies to support users' services effectively. Moreover, the CCH network along with the newly developed networking technologies can enable non-cognitive devices to significantly gain benefits from cognitive radio networks and provides innovative approaches to the cognitive radio networks design. Furthermore, this project research opens a new school of thoughts in better utilizing the residual network resources and potentially changes the design approaches for next-generation telecommunications systems. Finally, this project involves the international partners and can enhance the international components in the educational program and prepare more competitive workforce.",
