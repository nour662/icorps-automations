Ricketts\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) item for the R/V BLUE HERON; namely a new dual frequency echo sounder.  This item will enhance navigational safety and provide greatly improved science support capabilities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   The University of Minnesota supports federally-funded scientific research on the Great Lakes and routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to the marine sciences.  The R/V BLUE HERON is scheduled to complete over 50 NSF sponsored days in 2011.",
