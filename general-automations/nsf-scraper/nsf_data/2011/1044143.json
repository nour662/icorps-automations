Preservice mathematics coursework often fails to adequately prepare PSTs for the work of teaching. The coursework frequently focuses on the learning of content giving limited attention to how such knowledge is used in teaching practice, while providing relatively few experiences in applying PSTs' knowledge to analyze solution strategies or appraise mathematical explanations. In addition, mathematics faculty who teach content need to understand how to create opportunities for PSTs to learn mathematics in ways needed for teaching, a view of teaching and learning with which they are often unfamiliar.",
