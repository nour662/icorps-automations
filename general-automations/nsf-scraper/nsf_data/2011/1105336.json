 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Exchange-coupled magnetic systems are composite magnetic materials consisting of a mixture of magnetically hard and soft phases. By integrating these phases at the nanoscale it is possible to obtain simultaneously the best properties of each phase. A key challenge is to enhance the magnetic properties by improving the regularity of the nanostructure at the 10 nm length scale. This research proposes to achieve this through the development of the self-organized nanochessboard. This novel structure consists of a quasi-periodic tiling of the hard magnetic tetragonal (L10) phase interleaved with a soft magnetic cubic (L12) phase on the nanometer length scale. The nanoschessboard forms by pseudospinodal decomposition around the eutectoid composition in Co-Pt, Fe-Pt and Fe-Pd alloys. The structure features a nanoscale period conducive to strong exchange-coupled magnetism, while the high degree of regularity will enable the development of a deeper understanding of the structure-property relationship, and is expected to enhance the magnetic performance. This investigation will correlate how magnetic properties evolve as the nanochessboard structure is modified by varying the tiling period, the magnetic properties of the individual phases, and the tiling morphology.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Magnetic materials underpin several technologies of incredible importance to modern society, including electric motors and digital data storage. There is strong economic motivation to improve the properties of magnetic materials, which could, for example, reduce the weight of a motor or increase the density of data storage. This research will exploit a novel self-organization process to form a composite magnetic material, known as an \"exchange-spring magnet\", that offers greatly improved magnetic behavior. The new material that will be produced and studied here looks like a chessboard, except that the squares of the chessboard are only nanometers across, and consist of different magnetic materials that closely interact to improve performance. The research is expected to impact the important field of permanent magnet design, where exchange coupling is exploited to obtain maximum energy storage, and will also impact the field of magnetic recording media, where exchange-coupling is used to reduce coercivity in highly anisotropic, nanoscale ordered phases. Beyond the scientific and technological impacts of this research lies a strong commitment by the principal investigator to integrate research and education through the training of graduate students, and the exposure of undergraduate students to the research environment. Furthermore, the principal investigator directs and participates in extensive outreach activities focused on \"teaching nano to the public\".  Magnetism provides a highly visual, appealing approach to learning about nanoscale behavior. These outreach activities target a diverse population, including schools in underserved regions of central Virginia.",

Magnets with better properties could make electric motors smaller and lighter, could further increase the storage of information in hard drives, and could serve as critical elements in new logic and memory technologies. This NSF-funded project investigated the fascinating <em>nanochessboard</em> structure that self-organizes in Co-Pt binary alloys (see Figure 1). The project advanced our understanding of the nanochessboard in two key ways: First, the research more deeply probed the formation of the chessboard, identifying the boundaries of temperature and alloy composition over which it occurs, and how the nanoscale dimensions of the chessboard are controlled by thermal processing. &nbsp;Second, this was the first-ever study of the magnetic properties of the chessboard. The nanochessboard consists of two different solid phases, one of which is a so-called \"hard ferromagnet\" and the other of which is a soft ferromagnet. Theory predicts that when hard and soft ferromagents are combined together, forming a composite material, then a special behavior, called exchange-coupled ferromagnetism, can become important. By taking advantage of this behavior, the composite magnet may have better properties than either phase by itself. However, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">this behavior only occurs if the phases are intimately interleaved on the nanoscale</span>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Figure 2 shows a summary of key results on the boundaries of temperature and composition over which the nanochessboard can be obtained. This is called a binary phase diagram, and accurate knowledge of the diagram is critical to scientists trying to fabricate this structure. This project showed that previously published boundaries are considerably inaccurate. In determining, for example, at what temperature the chessboard begins to form (called the eutectoid isotherm), it is now possible to better control the size and amount of each magnetic phase.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; To look deeply into the exchange-coupled magnetic behavior, this project employed a special technique, called First Order Reversal Curve (FORC) analysis. This technique has been used by geologists in studying magnetic behavior of minerals to ascertain the paleological development of magnetic fields on Earth, and in space. However, FORC analysis is only just beginning to be used by materials scientists and physicists to understand magnetic properties of technologically-important materials. Figure 3 shows one key result - the lengthscale of the chessboard can be reduced by using a faster cooling rate, and this reduction in lengthscale takes the two magnetic phases (which are separately visible and therefore not fully coupled in the upper diagram), and through exchange-coupling, makes them appear as a singe phase working together (see the single peak in the lower diagram). This greatly improves the energy storage of the magnet and shows how the coupling is critically dependent on the size of the two structural phases.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; While the FORC analysis gives a macroscopic view of the magnetism, it is also important to understand the behavior of the individual elements of the structure on the nanoscale. This was investigated using micromagnetics modeling, which can simulate the relevant magnetic behavior in the idealized nanochessboard structure. These simulations revealed many interesting phenomena occurring in the chessboards, which combine in complex ways to give the overall behavior seen in the FORC plots, see Figure 4. The micromagnetics helped unravel the complex interactions between different aspects of the chessboard phases, including their shapes, and the presence of more than one \"easy-axis\", which is the direction in the nanocrystals along which the North-South poles of the magnets prefer to align. These results suggest new strategies for improving the properties of the composite magnet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; This project showed for the first time how processing, structure and magnetic properties of the Co-Pt nanochessboard combine to improve exchange-coupled magnetic behavior. At the same time, the results identify many new and exciting avenues for continued research. In particular, there are other materials where the nanochessboard should form, but where is has never been explored before. These materials offer advantages over Co-Pt alloys for both the magnetic properties, and in making the processing easier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Funding from the National Science Foundation was critical in promoting the fundamental understanding of this fascinating new material, which has uncovered new strategies for obtaining better magnetic properties for technologies of key importance to U.S. economic competitiveness.
