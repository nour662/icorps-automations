 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with estimates of wave equations on (both compact and noncompact) Riemannian manifolds, possibly with boundary.  The investigator is interested in how the geometry, the boundary and the regularity of the metric influence certain basic estimates.  Problems of this kind arise in the study of harmonic analysis on manifolds, the study of local and global solutions of nonlinear wave equations and in the study of eigenfunctions in quantum chaos.  Although these topics are widely separated in their physical and historical origins, the relevant mathematics is closely related.  Techniques and insights in the various areas cross-fertilize each other in a fruitful way.  In particular, a common theme of much current research (and the problems in this proposal) is to try to understand and exploit the mass concentration of eigenfunctions and solutions of linear and nonlinear wave equations. The basic estimates that we have in mind are Lebesgue-space estimates (both linear and bilinear) in space for eigenfunctions and quasimodes, and (local or global) Strichartz estimates in spacetime.  The main questions center around how the geometry and especially the presence of a boundary affects the estimates and the kinds of solutions that saturate them.  The latter issue is closely related to the much studied (but still not well understood) questions of concentration, oscillation and size properties of modes and quasimodes in spectral asymptotics.  In the non-compact setting it is also closely related to the distribution of resonances and their relations to trapped geodesics.  In the compact setting we are also interested in exploring how concentration properties of eigenfunctions are related to their nodal sets, which is the set of points where the function vanishes. The investigator wishes to use current and new estimates for eigenfunctions to make further progress on Yau's conjecture about the size of these sets.  He also is interested in seeing how certain curvature assumptions affect these estimates and exploring connections with quantum ergodicity.\r\n\r\nThe above problems arise naturally from interactions between mathematics and areas in physics that include general relativity, quantum mechanics, and quantum chaos.  The techniques employed include stationary phase and the study of propagation of singularities.  There is a very active group of researchers in quantum physics groups at major universities studying high-energy eigenstates, and the investigator is especially interested in making further contributions to this area.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe PI will studied several problems in Geometric Fourier Analysis.  The settings for these problems involve geometric manifolds of dimension two or more.  Associated to a given manifold are fundamental objects called eigenfunctions.  These are the fundamental modes of vibration of the manifold, and they are the higher dimensional analogs of the familiar trigonometric functions for the circle.  Designers of musical instruments are well aware that the shape of, say, a drum or the soundboard of stringed instrument affects the basic tones that it omits.  Similar phenomena arise for manifolds, and we wish to study precisely how their shapes, such as how they are curved, affect the resulting eigenfunctions.  Just as in music, one particularly expects different shapes and geometries to become more apparent in the behavior of the fundamental modes of vibration as the frequency becomes larger and larger.  These eigenfunctions are solutions of a differential equation that is similar to the wave equation, and we also wish to study similar problems involving it.  The general theme is to study how solutions of wave equations are affected by their physical backgrounds, such as whether or not black holes are present or whether the background becomes very close to a vacuum near infinity.\n\n Among the specific problems that were solved,  he was able to obtain improved estimates for the nodal sets (zero sets) of eigenfunctions.  There is a conjecture of Yau, which says that the size of this codimension one set should be comparable to its frequency.  Although it has been fully settled in the real analytic setting, less is known for smooth manifolds.  The PI showed that there are connections between this problem and Lebesgue space estimates for eigenfunctions which can detect certain types of  concentration.   Several other problems were solved in this active field.  The PI also obtained improved bounds for so-called period integrals of eigenfunctions under the assumption of negative curvature.  This assumption is known to be necessary, and the problem measures the random cancellation of eigenfunctions along geodesics.  There are connections with this problem and analytic number theory, but to date the results we have recently obtained using harmonic analysis are the best known.  \n\n Besides these research accomplishments, the PI mentored many young people including Postdocs and PhD students.  He was also involved several youngmathematicians who visited him from overseas.  Other broader impacts were realized through the completion and publication of a graduate level textbook on eigenfunctions.  This book, \"Hangzhou lectures on eigenfunctions of the Laplacian\", was based on lectures given by the PI in China and at Johns Hopkins University.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/14/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher D Sogge"
