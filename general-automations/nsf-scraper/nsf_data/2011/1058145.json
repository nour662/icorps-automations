 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in the development of a miniature airborne soot sensor for automotive diesel engine exhaust sensing applications. Current government regulations mandate that by 2012, all diesel vehicles sold in the United States will be equipped with onboard NOx and airborne particulate matter sensors. The proposed particulate matter sensor is based on the principle of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. This sensor technology will be miniaturized and hardened for use in an automotive application for airborne soot sensing. Design changes intended to meet aggressive cost-reduction goals are an important feature of the project. The end result will be an automotive-grade, low-cost airborne soot sensor that can ensure end-users? compliance with new diesel engine emissions standards.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a reduction in airborne particulate matter emissions. Airborne particulate matter has been identified by the US government as one of six criteria pollutants with potentially serious health and environmental effects. Among the largest sources of airborne particulate matter (PM) are diesel vehicles and power plants. We propose a new, low-cost and highly specific airborne soot sensor based on a miniature electron spin resonance sensor technology. The upcoming government regulations for onboard vehicle diagnostics, combined with similar regulations abroad create a market for approximately 6.3 million airborne soot sensors per year worldwide. It is expected that the worldwide market size for onboard airborne soot sensors will grow to approximately $350M/year as a result of upcoming regulatory changes.",
