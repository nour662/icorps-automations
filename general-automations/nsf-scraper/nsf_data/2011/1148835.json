 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to carry out its responsibilities as the adhering body for the United States to DIVERSITAS, an international program of biodiversity science. The Board on International Organizations (BISO) of the National Research Council (NRC) executes these responsibilities through the U.S. National Committee for DIVERSITAS (USNC). The overarching goal of the USNC is to contribute constructively to the two DIVERSITAS goals: 1) understanding biodiversity and its importance, and 2) managing biodiversity and ecosystem services in a sustainable way. DIVERSITAS will establish a US National Committee of academics, government scientists, NGOs and policy makers to will contribute to the science-policy interface related to biodiversity and ecosystem services issues and emerging international assessments.  Through national committee meetings and participation in national professional society meetings and international meetings, DIVERSITAS will be a liaison, bringing together the disparate elements of the broad U.S. community of academics, government scientists, NGOs and policy makers concerned with issues related to biodiversity and ecosystem services, and linking them with their counterparts around the world through the DIVERSITAS networks. Funds will provide support for the National Committee, organizational support for DIVERSITAS, and travel to national and international meetings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project had two primary goals:  1) informing and engaging the U.S. science community with respect to the IPBES process, and 2) supporting DIVERSITAS in its efforts to maintain the prominence of biodiversity and ecosystems services research within the international Global Change Research umbrella.  The work was performed by the U.S. National Committee for DIVERSITAS at the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\n\nThe Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), established in April 2012, is an independent intergovernmental body that will assess the state of the planet's biodiversity, its ecosystems, and the essential services they provide to society. IPBES, which to date counts with 114 member countries, will provide United Nations member governments with scientifically credible and independent information that takes into account the complex relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem services, and people. The biodiversity and ecosystem assessments to be undertaken around the world will be performed by experts in a wide range of fields. IPBES will also work to strengthen the dialogue between scientists, governments, and other stakeholders so they can understand their respective needs, thus allowing decision-makers to interpret this information in order to make effective decisions. IPBES will also aim to address the needs of Multilateral Environmental Agreements that are related to biodiversity and ecosystem services, and build on existing processes ensuring synergy and complementarities in each other's work (from IPBES website http://www.ipbes.net/about-ipbes.html).   The role of the USNC/DIVERSITAS was to inform and engage the U.S. scientific community and other stakeholders in the early stages of this process.\n\nEqually important is DIVERSITAS, a program established in 1991 to address the complex scientific questions posed by the loss in biodiversity and ecosystem services and to offer science-based solutions to this problem.  DIVERSITAS eventually became one of four Global Environmental Change programs operating under the umbrella of the International Council for Science (ICSU).  ICSU appointed DIVERSITAS to represent the international scientific community in the plenaries that took place before IPBES was established.  DIVERSITAS, therefore, has played and continues to play a pivotal role in the development of IPBES.\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences (NAS) represents the United States within DIVERSITAS, and as such has an interest in promoting excellent science within its programs.  Throughout the grant period, the USNC/DIVERSITAS organized and hosted several events, including sessions at the Ecological Society of America, at Planet Under Pressure, and at the Embassies of France and Sweden, to highlight the work of DIVERSITAS and IPBES.  The discussions at the various meetings of the committee explored the appropriate role for the USNC in informing and engaging the U.S. science community with respect to the IPBES. Each of the meetings included representatives of various stakeholders, including NGOs, professional scientific societies, international organizations, Embassy science attaches, and federal agencies. The lead U.S. IPBES negotiator actively participated in discussions with the USNC to develop a process to engage the U.S. scientific community in IPBES.\n\nBROADER IMPACTS\n\nOur planet is undergoing rapid change, and biodiversity loss is particularly serious.  A major report, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, released in 2005, documented a large and mostly irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth.  According to the report, 10-30 percent of bird, mammal, and amphibian species are threatened with extinction due to human action.  This biodiversity loss must be documented and brought to the public\u00c6s attention. IPBES is designed to do this.  The USNC/DIVERSITAS works to involve both the various stakeholder communities and the public at large to help them become aware ..."
