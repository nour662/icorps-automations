 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-1153476\r\nPI: Frankel\r\n\r\nThe proposed effort will initiate the development of a transformative calibration method for estimating surface heat flux in highly hostile thermal environments without requiring surface instrumentation. This concept has substantive merit for investigating: a) the effectiveness of thermal protection systems associated hypersonic flight vehicles or for understanding thermal efficiencies in hypersonic combustors; b) heat transfer on unreachable surface structures such as found in combustion liners, small chambers, and containment walls as a result of a hostile thermal event; and, c) heat transfer on structures emanating from pool fires or explosions. A comprehensive method is proposed that integrates physical, experimental, mathematical and computational principles.  The resulting analytic formulation implicitly possesses full-sensor characterization, probe positioning, host material thermophysical properties, diffusion physics, and mathematical constants required for stable and accurate surface heat flux predictions. The new calibration method leads to a Volterra integral equation of the first kind; and, thus the coupon or specimen can be interpreted as a transducer ready for practical implementation. Further analytical and computational study is required for real-world implementation. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal centers about critical applications for new material development involving high temperature environments.   Responsive state-of-the-art accurate methods for estimating surface heat flux and temperature that includes sensor characterization still requires resolution for many applications involving highly hostile environments. \r\n\r\nThe research effort will impact aerospace, energy, fire, combustion, geophysical, defense and national security research and developments in a timely and responsive manner.",
