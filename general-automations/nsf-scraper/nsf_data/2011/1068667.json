 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports a program of two experiments at Jefferson Lab which will use the parity-violating asymmetry in the scattering of polarized electrons to search for evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. The experiments are the ongoing Qweak measurement and a proposed new experiment for the 12 GeV era at Jefferson Lab, the MOLLER experiment. The first will provide a measurement of the proton's weak charge to 4% precision, and the second will make a 2.3% measurement of the weak charge of the electron. The two results will be complementary, as they are differently sensitive to possible parity-violating new physics, and both have a projected reach for new physics of this kind at the few TeV scale. The grant supports the PI as well as three graduate students, as well as undergraduate students.  \r\n\r\nThe principal broader impact of this project is graduate and undergraduate student education. The grant supports three graduate students as well as one undergraduate student; other undergraduates will be involved as well via the senior research projects that are required of all William & Mary physics majors. The PI served on a panel that reviewed the \"Standards of Learning\" for physics in K-12 education for the Commonwealth of Virginia, and helped to develop a related online resource textbook, and will partner with local schools to help implement the revised standards.",
