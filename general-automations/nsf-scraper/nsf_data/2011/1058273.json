 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rieske proteins are electron transport proteins involved in key biological processes, such as respiration and photosynthesis.  They have a [2Fe-2S] cluster ligated by 2 cysteine and 2 histidine ligands.  In the respiratory chain, the Rieske protein picks up an electron and a proton from quinol and transfers it to cytochrom c1.  Three aims will culminate in detailed information about the pH-dependent reduction potential of the Rieske protein. 1) The Rieske family of proteins is unique in that there is a highly conserved 3-dimensional structure, and yet there is a wide range of reduction potentials.  Work will test how iron-sulfur proteins tune reduction potential through concerted spectroscopic and structural studies of mutants designed to alter reduction potential.  2) The reactivity of the histidine ligands to chemical modifiers will provide insight into how the protein carries both a proton and an electron.  To probe the reactivity, diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) or other modifiers will be reacted with the protein to establish where the modification occurs.  How the reactivity changes with mutations that alter potential will tested the effect of the potential.  3) Rieske clusters are very stable to pH, yet the MitoNEET cluster, which is a [2Fe-2S] cluster ligated by 1 histidine and 3 cysteines, is not stable at low pH. Altering a Rieske protein to have a MitoNEET configuration will determine the role the protein fold plays in cluster stability.\r\nBroader Impacts: For the PI and the chemistry department at Trinity University, undergraduate research is an essential experience for aspiring chemists and biochemists.  The students work on fundamental problems in science, but since they are inexperienced, the training needs to be extensive and thorough.  Trinity has also been awarded a FAST grant and a McNair grant to increase participation the sciences, especially in those groups that are typically underrepresented and/or are first-generation college students.  Trinity University is seeking to actively engage the surrounding communities in research and bring underrepresented groups into the sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit: The oxygen that we breathe is reduced to water in an energy releasing process called respiration.  The reduction is accomplished through the action of the electron transport chain (ETC).  The Rieske protein (Figure 1) is part of the ETC and plays an integral role in the respiration process.  It is characterized by a [2Fe-2S] cluster that is ligated by two histidines and two cysteines (Figure 2).  How the Rieske protein functions, including how its structure and function are correlated are of fundamental importance.  In the ETC, Rieske becomes reduced and a measure of how easy it is to reduce is the reduction potential. For Rieske, the reduction potential is also dependent on pH. We have been studying how the structure of the protein is tied to the reduction potential and how it is dependent upon pH.  The factors that tune the potential include how many hydrogen bonds to the cluster there are, how solvent accessible the ligating histidines are and how close charged residues are to the cluster.  We have made mutations to the protein by changing single (or multiple) amino acids that alter each of these factors.  We have then measured the reduction potentials, looked at how reactive the ligating histidines are using chemical modification, and structurally characterized the proteins using X-Ray crystallography.  We have even proposed a new idea as to how the proteins tune potential- the effect of charges that are more distant from the cluster.  From these studies, we have a deep understanding of how these factors affect the reduction potential and the mechanism by which the reduction potential is pH-dependent.  We have published one paper in Journal of Biological Inorganic Chemistry and several more are in preparation.  In each of these manuscripts, the undergraduate researchers took on extensive roles in the writing of the papers and the production of the figures, in addition to the collection and analysis of the data. There have been 18 presentations at regional or national meetings of the work accomplished by the undergraduate researchers, one technician and the principle investigator (PI).  The work was accomplished by 12 different undergraduate researchers, one technician and one post-doctoral research associate.\n\nBroader impacts: The funding provided training for the next generation of scientists, by providing funding for the undergraduate researchers.  Undergraduate research is important since these young students are able to sample what it is like to be a full-time scientist, experiencing what it is like to work in a research lab.  For some students, the experience is life-changing, giving them a clear idea of the path they want to take.  It may cement their desire to go into research and/or onto post-graduate work.  It is also possible that it shows them that they don\u00c6t want to go into research, which is just as important.  Having the research experience early on in their careers is very helpful, since they can make needed changes to their major or their career path with more time.  In the Hunsicker-Wang lab, 75% of the student joined in their first or second year of college, which gives them the experience early on.    Both the post-doctoral research associate and the technician have also now gone onto secondary science education so they both will continue to aid in the education of future scientists.  The twelve undergraduate researchers included one first generation college student, one Latino and one African American student, along with several female students.  The work also supported the integration of research into the teaching laboratory since the PI incorporated a chemical modification lab on the Rieske protein into the Biochemistry teaching laboratory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/26/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laura Hunsicker-Wang"
