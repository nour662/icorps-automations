They plan to study luminescent molecularly imprinted polymer (MIPs) sensor arrays by combining (1) the selective luminescent properties of lanthanide-analyte coordination complexes with (2) the shape and functional group selectivity of molecular imprint polymers (MIPs).\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The increasing use of pesticides has led to greatly improved crop yields\r\nand agricultural productivity. However, this has also lead to the increasing problem of the\r\ncontamination of water supplies and food products with pesticide residues. The goal of this\r\nproject is to develop luminescent polymeric sensor arrays that can identify and measure the\r\nconcentrations of common pesticides in water. The luminescent imprinted polymer sensor arrays\r\nwill have long shelf-lives, yield rapid results, and require minimal of instrumentation.\r\nThe sensor arrays are comprised of different molecularly imprinted polymers that contain lanthanide\r\nbinding sites. Each polymer in the array will be synthesized in the presence of a different\r\npesticide or pesticide analog, which will allow the sensor arrays to be rationally tailored\r\nwith selectivity to specific groups or classes of analytes. The arrays will be highly sensitive\r\nand selective due to the luminescent lanthanide coordination sites that have high affinity\r\nand provide a very strong and easily measured change in emissive properties upon binding the\r\ntarget analytes. The collaboration involves DR. Hassan Azab who is an expert on the synthesis and characterization of luminescent lanthanide sensors and Dr. Ken D. Shimizu who is an expert\r\nthe synthesis and analysis of molecularly imprinted polymer sensor arrays.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The technological broader impact will be the development of new rapid and\r\ninexpensive methods for monitoring water purity and food safety. In addition, the new sensing\r\nplatform can also be readily adapted to target other analytes of interest such as pharmaceuticals,\r\nenvironmental pollutants and disease indicators. This international collaboration will also\r\nprovide a venue for the exchange of scientific expertise and the training of participating\r\ngraduate students. Monthly video-conferencing meetings will be held to allow participants\r\nto practice their presentation and communication skills, as well as, to exchange information.\r\nThe PIs will have exchange visits in each of the first two years to coordinate the project.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program where NSF supports the US side and the Government of Egypt funds the Egyptian side.",
