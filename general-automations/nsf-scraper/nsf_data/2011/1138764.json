The fields are poised to benefit from the development of a strategic vision for glycoscience and glycomics that crosses boundaries of funding agencies and research fields, including tools for characterization and analysis, databases and data management, and other fundamental infrastructure.  The proposed activity will advance US research in areas such as the conversion of biomass to fuel, biomass for material application, and cell-cell communication and recognition.  The proposed activity will also help build the infrastructure for chemical, biological, and materials research.",
