This meeting will take place at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, August 2-5, 2011. The emphasis of this conference is the integration of information across animal taxa, and the enabling of exchanges between young investigators and more established investigators in the field. They will consider acoustic communication, its mechanisms, and the detection of acoustic signals, particularly in noisy backgrounds. At the same time, they will examine communication within the context of how it develops, how it evolved, and its neuro-ethological basis\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThis conference will advance the field of animal bioacoustics. The information, knowledge and results of the meeting in the form of a program booklet containing the extended abstract will be distributed at the meeting and will be placed on the conference web site.",
