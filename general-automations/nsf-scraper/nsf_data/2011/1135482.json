These models will enable comprehensive examination of integrated system behavior through physically-based, data-driven simulations. Successful integration requires data, software, hardware, simulation models, and tools to visualize and disseminate results, as well as outreach to engage stakeholders and impart science into policy and management decisions. The project, called CI-WATER, will provide a robust and distributed CI consisting of integrated data services, modeling and visualization tools, and a comprehensive education and outreach program that can revolutionize how computer models are used to support water resources research in the Intermountain West and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The integrated data-intensive modeling enabled by the proposed CI will lead to better understanding of coupled natural and human water resources systems and their response and sensitivity to changes across space-time scales. Advances in data and modeling systems that enhance HPC usability and access by non-HPC specialists will transform the way hydrologic knowledge is created and provide broader informatics applicability beyond the field of water resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project will provide CI that improves access to data and sophisticated models, enable scientists to populate models with readily accessible data, harness HPC resources to perform multi-decadal simulations over large spatial areas with space-time resolution, and transform the way hydrologic knowledge is used in water resource planning and management. The CI enhancements will be integrated into a robust education program focused on improving cyber-literacy throughout the region",
