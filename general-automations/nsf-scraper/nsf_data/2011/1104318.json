 "awd_abstract_narration": "In partnership with Los Alamos National Lab, Los Alamos County, and other employers, the University of New Mexico-Los Alamos is building a robust two-year cybersecurity program that both increases the number of highly-skilled technicians for the region's employers and provides opportunities for retraining and certifying existing workers. For this program, the investigators are adapting cybersecurity curricula developed by the Cyber Security Education Consortium (CSEC), an NSF ATE center of excellence. Activities include:\r\n\r\n* providing rich internship and hands-on classroom experiences that deepen students' understanding of complex IT systems and their security needs;\r\n\r\n* creating a pipeline to IT careers for high school graduates and college students;\r\n\r\n* exciting students' interest in IT and cybersecurity through events such as a \"Capture the Flag\" challenge and mini-technology workshops;\r\n\r\n* creating seamless transfer opportunities from the two-year program to four-year programs;\r\n\r\n* providing opportunities for existing IT workers to build their skills and achieve certifications in cybersecurity; and\r\n\r\n* providing professional development for two-year college faculty and high school technology teachers.\r\n\r\nTo improve retention, the project is emphasizing student support through a career development facilitator, a redesigned Tutor Center, and an equity awareness program. To reach Hispanic and Native American students better, the project is utilizing contacts with educational organizations tied to those constituencies and showing those students local job opportunities that allow them to stay close to family.\r\n\r\nOther features of the project include integrating problem-solving skills with hands-on projects to prepare students for the workplace, establishing a successful internship/co-op program, expanding and enriching online components with smart-classroom technologies, and testing an arrangement for small institutions to share courses.\r\n\r\nThe investigators are sharing the program design, curriculum, and sustainability concepts with partner community colleges across New Mexico, and helping train both community college partners and high school teachers in the curriculum and hands-on activities through combined workshops.",

We designed a program that includes critical thinking, problem-solving, and ethical issues, as well as the usual skills sets in associate level IT work. It has been industry reviewed by IT experts at our national laboratory in Los Alamos and IT professionals at Los Alamos County. \n\nContinued mapping of the curriculum to CISSPcertification  standards is ongoing. Additional concentrations to increase expertise are under consideration.\n\nOur plan to create a pipeline means that we have created awareness of and participation in IT from youth, middle school and high school with summer programs, \"Capture the Flag\" and other \"challenge\" events, and even females only events. \n\nWe provided high school teacher training for IT and created a high school level IT curriculum mapped to common core standards, which is available for any high school that requests it. \n\nOur two-year degree also offers the opportunity for students to compete for an internship at Los Alamos National Lab.  Such an internship provides ten weeks of training in various departments, so students gain real workplace knowledge, soft skills needed by employers, and - in our case - job offers at the end of the internship. \n\nAdditional student support was built  by increasing our Academic Support Center's capacity, as well as working with Student Services advisors and faculty, with intrusive advising and tutoring, particularly in math.  Progress toward degree is a primary concern when over 90% of our students work and support families, so education is an additional but incredible important aspect of their lives.\n\nAdvanced IT training offered through continuing education, with Attack Research providing \"Red Hat\" type workshops furthered the idea of a pipeline of IT education even to career IT specialists.
