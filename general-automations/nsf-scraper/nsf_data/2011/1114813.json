The conference was preceded by two workshops: an intensive hands-on training workshop (\"Computational Molecular Biophysics\") and a student-centered mini-conference (\"The Physics of Living Systems\"). \n Over two dozen graduate students and postdoctoral scholars received leading-edge practical training in molecular dynamics techniques and coarse-grained simulations with biophysical applications in the computational molecular biophysics workshop organized by Prof. Andy McCammon (UCSD) and Robert Konecny (CTBP/NBCR, UCSD). \n The Physics of Living Systems (PoLS) mini-conference was the collaborative effort of faculty and graduate students at UCSD, the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Y..."
