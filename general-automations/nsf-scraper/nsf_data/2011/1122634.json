 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flowering, seed production, and seedling establishment of tropical forest plants vary tremendously in time and space, contributing to the rich diversity that characterizes tropical forests.  This long-term study quantifies this variation in three Neotropical forests in Puerto Rico, Ecuador, and Panama that vary dramatically in climate.  Using identical methods at each site, flowering and seed production will be monitored throughout the year and seedling establishment measured annually within large permanent plots where all trees are mapped and measured regularly. High resolution bar code phylogenies and complete measurements of adult and seedling functional traits will add an evolutionary perspective to the current ecological study.  The resulting data will be used to test hypotheses relating interannual variation to natural climate cycles or to anthropogenic global change, and to evaluate the importance of spatio-temporal variation in reproduction and establishment to tropical forest diversity.  \r\n \r\nUnderstanding tropical plant regeneration is of fundamental and applied importance; tropical forests account for approximately 60% of plant species diversity, 35% of plant productivity, and 25% of plant carbon stores on land. The long-term, quantitative data on reproduction and early regeneration from this study will enable identification of relationships between plant reproduction and climate variation, and prediction of long-term trends. Data and associated analyses are publicly accessible. At least 25 undergraduates and graduate students, including several Hispanics, will receive training at the University of Puerto Rico and Southern Illinois University, and the career progression of one post-doctoral associate from the University California, Davis, will be facilitated.",

The seed and seedling stages are particularly vulnerable bottlenecks in a plant?s life, and processes that affect patterns of successful flowering, seed production, or seedling survival play a large role in determining patterns of forest diversity.\n\nThis study has compared long-term data on plant reproduction and seedling establishment in three Neotropical forests in Ecuador, Puerto Rico, and Panama for 18, 26, and 31 years, respectively.

We have found that seedling establishment is highly variable in space and time, and depends on the density or proximity of neighbors, characteristics of the physical environment, and differences among species in seed dispersal distances. Our data have also supported the development of new theoretical models that examine trade-offs in species? reproductive outputs, the ability to withstand environmental stresses, and strategies for responding to disturbances.  Our research provides important tests of these models and contributes to our understanding of changes in species? abundances and the maintenance of diverse regeneration strategies. \n\nOur research is important to understanding how natural and anthropogenic climatic variability drives regeneration in tropical forests, with consequences for managing forests for silviculture or conservation as well as for assessment of the potential impacts of global climate change.  Seasonal patterns of plant reproduction have long been known for tropical forests that experience a strong dry season, as does our site in Panama.  In contrast, our sites in Ecuador and Puerto Rico are ever-wet, that is, they lack even a short dry season; but, we have found that plant reproduction is also seasonal (i.e., non-continuous) at these sites, both at the level of the entire forest and for individual species.

We have mentored several undergraduates from under-represented groups in independent research projects associated with this project as part of Research Experience for Undergraduates grants from NSF or as part of summer research programs at their home institution.  The project has aided in the training and professional development of several graduate students and post-docs.

Results from our project have been published in 47 refereed journal articles, with three more papers submitted for publication and others in preparation, and have been presented at numerous scientific meetings over the last decade.  Data from our project have also contributed to three books and one thesis.
