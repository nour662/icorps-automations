These workshops are designed to explore computational methods for use in conjunction with the HPC systems acquired with funding from the National Science Foundation (Grants 0958379 and 0855217).\r\nThe goal of the workshop series is to accelerate the use of computational science to solve critical problems in science, engineering, and other disciplines by promoting an exchange of information between systems developers, software developers, and domain scientists. To accomplish this goal, the workshop series will explore long-term trends in high performance computing as well as the very recent developments in processor accelerator technology, for example graphics processing units (GPUs), and in partitioned global address space (PGAS) programming models and how these recent developments are part of an evolutionary path to future exascale high performance computing systems.",
