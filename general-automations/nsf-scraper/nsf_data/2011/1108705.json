 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a broad community based study of the science opportunities and technology challenges in high magnetic field research. The study will be forward looking and addresses the decade beyond that addressed in the 2005 NRC report, on Opportunities in High Magnetic Field Science. The study is conducted by the Board on Physics and Astronomy, in consultation with the Board on Life Sciences, Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology, and the National Materials and Manufacturing Board. It will provide an assessment of the current status of the high magnetic field program in the United States and an analysis of trends in the makeup of the principal user groups of that program. The study will develop recommendations for the future of magnetic-field research and technology development for this area given the needs of current and anticipated user communities and in the context of other programs worldwide.   The outcome of the study will be a report that will be published and made broadly available to the community. Funding for the study is provided by the Biosciences directorate, and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences directorate (Chemistry Division, Division of Materials Research and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary activities) at NSF.",
