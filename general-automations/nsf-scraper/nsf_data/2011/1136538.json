 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  goal  of  this  research involves the study of high-end  parallel  finite element mesh generation software capable to deliver and sustain concurrency  which will fully utilize  current  Teraflop   and  next  generation  Petaflop  high-end architectures.  Other than the direct impact to supercomputing this research will have a broader impact to many (bio-) engineering applications that can benefit from scalable field solvers and Teraflop/ Petaflop supercomputers.  Such software can also provide challenging and realistic benchmarks which can help to understand the behavior of end-to-end dynamic  applications on multi-layered architectures, and thus will be invaluable for the performance evaluation community and design of new supercomputers.\r\n\r\nThe expected outcome of this research is  an  effective   and  efficient implementation  of   adaptive  finite  element   mesh  generation  and refinement on high-end parallel architectures.  However, parallel mesh generation belongs to the broader class of  adaptive and irregular applications which are challenging and labor  intensive to develop and maintain. As a result, parallel mesh generation is one of the last applications to be installed on parallel architectures. This research will  remedy  this problem for high-end architectures by   focusing on the following objectives. Develop a runtime  system  for multi-layered  parallel  adaptive and  irregular applications that can efficiently orchestrate intra-  and inter-layer data movement and load balancing. Use the runtime system to design an evolutionary  approach  for  developing  multi-layered  parallel  mesh generation software  capable of exposing concurrency from the very beginning of the execution and sustaining up to one quadrillion concurrent work units.",
