 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Alabama State University HBCU-UP project, Computational Biology and NanoBiotechnology Undergraduate Research and Education (CNURE) program has a central intent to implement new teaching and research programs in computational biology and nanobiotechnology for undergraduates. The project expects to achieve this through implementation of five components:  1) reforming STEM curricula; 2) providing research experience to undergraduates through academic and summer research opportunities at major institutions, private companies, international institutions and federal laboratories; 3) engaging faculty in research and professional development; 4) infusing technology in educational and research programs; and 5) enhancing recruitment, retention and transition of STEM students through high school to graduate school. The upper level STEM curriculum will be the focus of the curricula redesign to provide STEM majors with up-to-date education and training in computer science, computational biology, bioinformatics, biochemistry, and nanoscience. Faculty development opportunities will be provided to assist faculty in developing innovative teaching practices, improving research skills, and initiating research collaborations. The CNURE project specifically will provide to STEM students the unique and specialized education and research training needed for computational biology and bioinformatics. The project is anchored on the infrastructure built from the previous HBCU-UP award and is integrated with a current CREST award (Center for NanoBiotechnology Infrastructure).",
