He gave lectures to undergraduate students on research topics in dynamics and geometry and helped organize a learning seminar for graduate students in complex dynamics.  Additionally, the PI gave a series of lectures at an educational retreat aimed at beginning graduate students with the goal of gently introducing them to topics in current research.\n\n \n\nSome highlights of the PI\u00c6s research achievements during the fellowship tenure include:\n\n \n\n(1)  He developed an algorithm to compute \"Veech groups\" of polygonal billiard tables.  These are groups are symmetries of polygons and are important tools for understanding these dynamical systems.  His algorithm and its freely available implementation in Sage have recently been used to establish certain new polygons have the important lattice property.\n\n(2)  Together with A. Kumar (MIT), the PI computed the algebraic equations defining Teichmuller curves associated to certain polygonal billiard tables.  These equations are the first of their kind and revealed deep connections between dynamics and number theory.\n\n(3)  He developed a method, based on existing numerical integration tools, to evaluate the Teichmuller norm on moduli spaces.  Using this method, he gave the first accurate way to picture of this norm, yielding beautiful visualizations of a celebrated theorem of Royden\u00c6s from the 1970\u00c6s.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/19/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ronen Mukamel"
