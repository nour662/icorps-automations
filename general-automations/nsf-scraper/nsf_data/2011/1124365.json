The purpose of this symposium is to educate both the Committee and the Oklahoma biomass conversion research community on the latest innovations in bioenergy and biobased products, with special emphasis on thermochemical conversion of biomass to liquid fuels.  The symposium will host 7-8 speakers, covering the following topics:  biomass gasification, pyrolysis, conversion of bio-oil to useful products, and conversion of syngas to alcohols through heterogeneous and biological catalysis.  All speakers will be nationally recognized experts in their respective research areas.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThere is a large community of researchers at Oklahoma State University, University of Oklahoma, and local Oklahoma companies who are interested in thermochemical conversion of biomass to liquid fuels.   The symposium will also encourage participation from the Native American nations that are in close proximity to the Oklahoma State University campus in order to educate their leaders about how their nations could benefit from potential opportunities offered through thermochemical biomass conversion technology. Graduate and undergraduate students on campus for summer research will also be encouraged to attend the symposium, which will allow them to interact with top researchers in bioenergy. The symposium will also promote the Oklahoma-EPSCoR NSF project on Bioenergy that is currently underway.",
