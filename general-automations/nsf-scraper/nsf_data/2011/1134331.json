 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this planning project researchers from the U.S. and Mexico will catalyze a collaboration between archaeologists at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) and the Unversidad del Oriente (UNO) in Vallodolid, Yucatan, Mexico.  The collaboration is focused on an archaeological investigation of the interaction of macro-political change with local landscape and residence.  Due to the specific occupational history of the Yucat\u00e1n, this area is a promising locale for this research.  Importantly, the presence of local indigenous communities presents an opportunity to refine methods of community-based participatory research within archaeology.  Two researchers from UNC-CH, Drs. Patricia A. McAnany & Shoshaunna Parks and two graduate students will collaborate with Dr.Adolfo Ivan Bat\u00fan Alpuche of Universidad del Oriente (UNO) and his undergraduate students.  The proposal that will result from this planning grant will examine how the series of seismic political changes in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula from the Terminal Classic period (800-1000 CE) through the 19th century affected landscape use as well as the quotidian activities of non-elite Maya household members, particularly women and their tribute-related work of cotton cloth production.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this project include the refinement of methods within Maya Archaeology that combine cutting-edge science with knowledge-sharing programs that engage indigenous communities and enhancement of Maya cultural survival and of the conservation of local heritage places.  The long-term project to follow this planning grant will offer educational opportunities to children, youth, and adults through workshops, radio broadcasts, and performances via local NGOs and primary/secondary schools.  U.S. students and a young female faculty member will also participate in these investigations.  Involvement of junior researchers in international research is a major goal of OISE.",

The purpose of the archaeological research was to locate colonial-period (16<sup>th</sup> to 18<sup>th</sup> century) archaeological sites that are proximate to contemporary communities in the eastern part of Yucat&aacute;n, M&eacute;xico. The proximity of contemporary communities is important because the project is collaborative with community. This means that there exists give-and-take of knowledge and skills internationally and between academic and lay communities. The collaboration is extended academically with a partnership also formed between the local university in Valladolid, Yucat&aacute;n (Universidad de Oriente) and a trained archaeologist from the university, Dr. Ivan Batun-Alpuche and the Research Labs of Archaeology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

Although the colonial churches are important community features, this research is focused on the more difficult-to-detect but vitally important and understudied dwellings of the laborers who were part of the mission congregations. Surface collection in sampled units around the periphery of the church was implemented to detect areas in which such dwellings can be located and did succeed in identifying several locales that can next be tested through excavation.
