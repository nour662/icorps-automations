 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Career award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Purdue University is to study mucus materials with abnormal rheological properties that significantly interfere with effective transport of nanoparticles. This project is to develop a new drug delivery strategy utilizing osmotic agents to overcome the mucus barrier. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that osmolytic agents will induce local influx of water in mucus materials to generate two favorable effects for nanoparticle diffusion: (1) induce collapse of neighboring biopolymer network, thereby increasing the spacing in the polymer mesh; and (2) decrease the viscosity of liquid in microscopic domains within the network. This project will use microscopic techniques to compare various osmolytic agents for the effect on transmucosal nanoparticle diffusion, design formulations that integrate effective osmolytic agents and nanoparticle, and evaluate the effectiveness of the osmolyte formulations using a chronic lung infection model. The outcome of this study will enhance understanding of mucus materials as a physiological barrier to drug delivery and would provide a reasonable strategy to improve treatment of diseases suffering from the mucus barrier. The proposed research will contribute to the education of next generation materials scientists, by training students in cutting-edge experimental techniques and working knowledge in the related fields. In addition, the PI will create an undergraduate class that develops training materials for K-12 students in collaboration with the Purdue Engineering Projects in Community Service.\r\n\r\nDelivering nanoparticulate therapeutics to tissues covered by abnormally thickened mucus is challenging because the mucus materials behave as a physical and chemical trap of particles and thus interfere with effective therapy in cystic fibrosis, chronic lung diseases or other related ones. The proposed project will introduce osmolytic agents in the formulation to enhance the nanoparticles penetration into the mucus materials. The underlying hypothesis is that an effective osmolytic agent will cause influx of water into the mucus and, thus, create pores that are easier for nanoparticles to travel through. This project will compare various osmotic agents for the ability to influence mucus, design and produce pharmaceutical formulations combining nanoparticles and the osmotic agents, and evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy using an animal model with chronic lung infection. The outcome of this study will enhance understanding of mucus as a physiological barrier to drug delivery, and would provide a reasonable strategy to improve treatment of diseases suffering from the mucus barrier. The proposed research will contribute to the education of next generation biomaterial scientists and engineers, by training students in cutting-edge experimental techniques and providing them with hand-on experiences. In collaboration with the Purdue Engineering Projects in Community Service, the project will create an educational program that engages K-12 and undergraduate students to stimulate public interest in science and technology.",

We aimed to understand the effect of rheological properties of pathological mucus on transmucosal NP transport and engineer rational pharmaceutical formulations that maximize the delivery of NPs as therapeutic agents to target tissues. We demonstrated that osmotic agents formulated along with NPs helped transport NPs through highly viscous mucus by facilitating water influx (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>). We also developed a new NP surface modification strategy to enable easy and versatile functionalization of NPs, thereby increasing their target specificity (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>). While these approaches helped NPs reach target tissues, it became increasingly clear that stability of NPs during the transport should further be improved in order to deliver bioactive gene therapeutics and small molecule drugs. To this end, we developed a unique nanocrystal system, coated with intact albumin, which could circulate for a prolonged period to reach tumors to a greater extent than a solution counterpart. To improve the stability of gene therapeutics, we used two polycation-based platforms, one complexed with dermatan sulfate and the other conjugated with bile acid. Both carriers successfully delivered therapeutic genes (siRNA and plasmid DNA) systemically. These carriers also showed unexpected activities that may be explored in different applications. The polycation-dermatan sulfate shows a specific toxicity to a certain group of tumor cells (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>) and may facilitate cancer therapy. The lithocholic acid-conjugated polycation forms filamentous drug-polymer assemblies with hydrophobic drugs, which can be used for drug/gene combination therapy. Moreover, the flexible filamentous shape is expected to facilitate lung-targeted drug delivery.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader impact&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Twenty undergraduate and professional degree students did undergraduate research in the PI&rsquo;s laboratory for academic credits and summer fellowship between 2011-2017.

The PI also participated in outreach activities through the Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) program, which served undergraduate students at Purdue as well as high school students and teachers in the Greater Lafayette area. The PI initiated a new EPICS team in 2011 (Play-2-Learn, P2L), which aimed to support K-12 science education and provide undergraduate students with working knowledge of science topics. The mission of the P2L team was to develop science education materials for K-12 students, such as interactive lab modules and educational video clips, which K-12 students can make, try, exercise, and watch, to learn various science subjects. The P2L team collaborated with the science department at Jefferson High school in Lafayette, Indiana, and delivered three projects (Electron configuration battleship game, Acid/base titration lab, and the Rubens tube) to the classroom (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>).
