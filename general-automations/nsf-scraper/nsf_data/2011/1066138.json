  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNortheastern University was awarded a grant to support and host two conferences for the community of faculty who work within the purview of the Civil Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation Division within the National Science Foundation Engineering Directorate. \n\n \n\nThe first conference was the 2012 NSF Engineering Research and Innovation conference held July 9 &ndash; 12, 2012 in Boston, Massachusetts.  This conference was held in conjunction with the George E. Brown Networking for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Quake Summit &ndash; 2012.  The conference theme, Engineering Transformation through Partnerships, evoked the academic city that is Boston.  Through presentations and technical tours, an estimated 1200 attendees from academe, industry, and government were able to share first-hand real partnership successes addressing real problems, and contributed to the dialogue on using partnerships effectively to address future challenges.  Conference subthemes were: 1) Partnered interdisciplinary research; 2) Partnerships up (with decision-makers and research funders) ; and 3) Partnerships out (engagement with society).  The conference activities included featured speakers from academia, outreach, and industry; breakout sessions to disseminate funding opportunities, research needs, opportunities, and best-practices; technical tours of local technical facilities; poster sessions featuring more than 1000 projects; graduate student skills tracks; outreach activities; and opportunities for networking.\n\n \n\nThe second conference was the 2015 NSF CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop held April 27 &ndash; 28, 2015 at Northeastern University in Boston, MA.  This annual workshop is co-sponsored by a host university and the Kansas Sate University.  In 2015 the local university was Northeastern.  The workshop aims to provide future CAREER proposal submitters with proposal review experience and interactions with NSF program directors and recent NSF CAREER awardees.   The agenda is designed to be experiential and participants engage in two days of proposal review where they actively apply the proposal writing / review tips in simulated NSF review panels.  Presentations are given by NSF Program Directors who speak about elements that are essential for successful CAREER proposals and recent CAREER Proposal recipients.  The experiential component enables participants to engage in a research proposal review simulation.  Participants are expected to read actual proposals (some awarded by NSF) submitted to the CAREER competition and they review and write reviews for each proposal.  Participants submit a 1 page summary of their own CAREER proposals and they receive feedback from their peers. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sara Wadia-Fascetti"
