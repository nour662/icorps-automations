 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluid dynamics has historically been a driving force in applied mathematics and scientific computing.\r\nIn biological settings, a level of complexity is added to traditional fluid dynamics since\r\ntypically biological flows are unsteady, involve active and elastic interfaces, fluid-structure interactions\r\nand transport of chemical signals. This Research and Training project, led by faculty in the\r\nDepartments of Mathematics and Biomedical Engineering at Tulane University, recognizes the need\r\nfor students trained at the interface of mathematics and the biomedical sciences. Three graduate\r\nstudents, six undergraduate students and two postdoctoral fellows will be supported each year. A\r\nbroad spectrum of research projects will be emphasized that span mathematical analysis, development\r\nand analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations, modeling of complex\r\nbiological systems, three-dimensional simulations on high-performance computers, and a two-way\r\ncoordination of modeling with experiments. Training activities will include a curriculum with core\r\ncourses from both the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Biomedical Engineering,\r\nregular group meetings, a monthly Biofluids All-Hands meeting, a wet-lab and internship program\r\nfor graduate students and postdocs, professional development seminars, an annual Carnival Focus\r\nDays (CFD) workshop and high-performance computing training activities. Moreover, undergraduate\r\nstudents will be fully-integrated into research teams through academic year involvement and\r\nintensive summer research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMathematics has had a huge impact on the engineering,  biological and physical sciences through its development\r\nof theoretical analyses and numerical methods. Biological fluid dynamics, in addition\r\nto its direct applications in physiology and oceanography, provides a rich educational and training\r\nplatform for students in the mathematical sciences. Undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral\r\nstudents will work in teams, with representation from both Mathematics and Biomedical\r\nEngineering, and with an emphasis on the interplay between theory, computation and experiment.\r\nResearch projects will be motivated by applications, including microorganism motility, pulmonary\r\nmechanics, biosensors and cellular biomechanics. All graduate and postdoctoral students will participate\r\nin an internship, either at Tulane University or at a partner institution, where they can\r\nwork side-by-side with experimentalists, develop a comprehensive understanding of various aspects\r\nof the research project, and participate in the life of a working fluids lab. The co-PIs, all co-founders\r\nof Tulane's Center for Computational Science, have demonstrated commitment to this model of\r\ntraining. They are, themselves, diverse, and have been actively involved in increasing the number\r\nof US women and minorities in scientific research. This training program will attract diverse\r\nAmerican nationals into the mathematical sciences.",
