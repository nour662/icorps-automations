The principal speaker will be Professor Donald Saari from the University of California at Irvine. This award will support 30 participants at different stages of their careers. \r\n\r\nAfter an introductory lecture, Professor Saari's presentations will focus on the following topics:  symmetries and paired comparisons, impossibility theorems, symmetries and voting problems, applications of symmetries to more general decision problems, dynamics of social and behavioral systems, and topological structures applied to psychology.  He will conclude with a presentation on open problems.",
