Autenrieth. The funding will pay travel expenses for a team of three site members to participate in the 2010 Teacher Research Experience (TRE) Conference, to be held at Inner Harbor, Maryland on October 21-24, 2010. This conference is being sponsored by NOAA, NSF, Department of Energy, Department of Education, Columbia University and COSEE. Eight NSF RET in Engineering Site Programs have been invited to participate in this multi-agency conference. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the TRE Conference is to engage the teacher research experience program community by: 1) identifying operational and evaluation best practices, 2) establishing connections and partnerships between programs, and 3) collaborating to meet individual project challenges. The main conference themes are: 1) Evaluation; 2) Sustainability; and 3) Transfer.",
