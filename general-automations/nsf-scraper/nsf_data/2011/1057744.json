 "awd_abstract_narration": "Summary\r\nThe provision of potable water in urbanizing arid regions is a critical challenge worldwide. The state of Baja California Sur (BCS) is located in Mexico's most arid region where groundwater supplies are insufficient to meet demands. Desalination?the conversion of saline water into potable water offers a potentially limitless supply and is becoming the preferred augmentation strategy in BCS. While desalination can reduce some vulnerabilities (e.g., future water supply), it may increase others (e.g., equity, affordability, environmental impacts, and energy demands). Research will be carried out over a 9-month period in two research sites in BCS (Los Cabos and La Paz), using semi-structured interviews, focus groups, household surveys, and a time-series analysis of secondary data. \r\nSignificance & broader impact\r\nExisting research concludes that while large-scale water infrastructure projects (e.g., dams) have facilitated economic development, they have typically resulted in inequitable social outcomes and negative environmental impacts. This research examines how desalination, a relatively new water infrastructure technology, transforms and is transformed by social and environmental relations\r\n By framing desalination as an adaptive management strategy for dealing with growth and climate change, this research will illuminate how technology can alleviate or exacerbate vulnerability to water scarcity. It also highlights the decision-making and regulatory processes involved in adaptation actions. The study addresses an important gap in the understanding of the social and environmental consequences of desalination technology. The policy-oriented approach will develop a set of best management practices for water managers and decision-makers considering the adoption of desalination technology.",
