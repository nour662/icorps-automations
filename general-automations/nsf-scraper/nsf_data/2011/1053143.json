 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtually any computer system can be compromised.  New software vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited daily, and even if software were bug-free, unaware users may install malware along with free screensavers or greeting cards they download online. Cleaning up after these inevitable compromises leads to days of wasted effort by users or system administrators, with no conclusive guarantee that all traces of the attack are gone, or that no legitimate changes are lost.\r\n\r\nThis research project automates recovery from intrusions by developing a system-wide undo mechanism, so that an administrator can undo an attacker's break-in attempt, along with all of its side-effects, while preserving all other legitimate operations. The key idea is to log all computations, such as processes or system calls, and the dependencies between them, so that if one operation needs to be undone, the system can both undo its direct effects, and recursively track down and re-execute other operations that may have been indirectly affected.  Building on this basic approach, the project explores how computer systems must change to securely and efficiently provide system-wide undo, from operating system kernels, to programming languages, to applications and user interfaces.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will provide a principled approach to recovering from intrusions in computer systems.  More broadly, system-wide undo may help in many situations, such as users that realize they changed the wrong setting a week ago, students that want to learn a new system by exploring and undoing, or application developers that want to experiment with a large-scale system.",

When an administrator determines that an attack has taken place, the system rolls back the affected parts of the system, and re-executes any programs that might have been affected, using the recorded inputs and dependencies.  This allows an administrator to remove the effects of an attack while preserving legitimate user changes.\n\nTo make system-wide intrusion recovery possible, this project explored two main research directions: first, how to build secure systems that can prevent an adversary from tampering with a system-wide log, and second, how to use this log to recover from different types of attacks.\n\nOn the secure systems front, this project developed several bug-finding tools (KINT and STACK) that can analyze existing C and C++ source code to discover common types of security errors.
