The discovery and development of new surface processes and the improvement of existing ones, particularly in the area of photovoltaics, can make important contributions to securing the nation's energy supply. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests support for the 2011 Gordon Conference on Chemical\r\nReactions at Surfaces. The conference, which will be held at the Ventura Beach Marriot\r\nin Ventura, California on February 6 - 11, 2011, will bring together leading experts to\r\ndiscuss the latest and most exciting work in the field. Topics include:\r\n-\tcatalysis by metals, \r\n-\tenergy conversion at surfaces, \r\n-\thydrogen production and separation at surfaces, \r\n-\tliquids at surfaces, \r\n-\tinterfacial chemistry in photovoltaics,\r\n-\tchemical reactions at oxide surfaces, \r\n-\tsurface chemistry of CO2 conversion.\r\n\r\nA special effort will be made to support young scientists who otherwise would be unable to attend: junior faculty members, postdoctoral fellows and advanced graduate students. Participation by young researchers will add significant value to this conference and will foster communications among current and future leaders in a field that combines academic and industrial issues. The setting and program for the conference keeps the participants on site and maximizes interactions and intellectual discourse and networking.",
