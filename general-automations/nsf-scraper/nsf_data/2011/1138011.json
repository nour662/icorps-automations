The principal speaker will be Douglas Arnold, McKnight Presidential Professor of Mathematics at the University of Minnesota.  This award will support 25 participants at different stages of their careers.\r\n\r\nFinite element exterior caluculs (FEEC) is a recently developed theory that provides a framework for understanding and constructing numerical methods that are used for solving partial differential equations. It touches on many different fields of mathematics, including differential geometry, algebraic topology, and homological algebra. This conference will demonstrate how these areas of mathematics can be linked together to better understand the structure of underlying problems and develop computational methods.",
