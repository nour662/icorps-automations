This multimodal system can comprehensively characterize the optical absorption, optical scattering, and autofluorescence properties, which can be correlated to hemoglobin oxygen saturation, blood flow, pigment content, and metabolic rate in the retina. Then, by applying this novel imaging technology, a hemodynamic threshold will be detected, optimized, and verified in an ischemic retinopathy rat model to fill the gap of early detection of DR. And finally, the content of the two key pigments in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), melanin and lipofuscin, and their content ratio in single RPE cells will be measured to be used as a risk factor of RPE dysfunction, which leads to AMD. At the end of the project, the project team will have developed a one-of-a-kind multimodal retinal imaging technology, identified the earliest functional onset of DR, and acquired the baseline pigment ratio for further evaluation of RPE dysfunction.",

The two imaging modalities are photoacoustic ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography. In our initial design, photoacoustic ophthalmoscopy, a hybrid technology that detects laser induced ultrasonic signals from the retina, will provide the unique imaging capability to quantify blood oxygenation in the retinal vessels. Meanwhile, optical coherence tomography will measure blood flow based on Doppler effect. During the technology development process, in order to overcome the challenge in identifying an eye-compatible ultrasonic detector, we developed a unique optically transparent micro-ring resonator ultrasound detector, which has a dimension of less than 1 mm. Currently, this new ultrasonic detector (Figure 1) has drown interests from several scientific research communities, such as brain imaging, organic chemistry, and geology.</p>\n<p>The most exciting achievement at the end of this project period is the development of visible-light optical coherence. As we were optimizing photoacoustic ophthalmoscopy for blood oxygenation imaging, we found out that by shifting the illuminating spectral range from near-infrared to visible light spectral range, optical coherence tomography can also achieve blood oxygenation quantification while maintaining high quality anatomical imaging and Doppler imaging capabilities (Figure 2). Since then, we decided to pivot our research direction and started to focus on developing and optimizing visible-light optical coherence tomography. We have imaged several rodent models of retinal retinopathy, macular degeneration, and glaucoma. Moreover, we are aggressively pushing visible-light optical coherence tomography to the clinics (Figure 3) and have achieved high quality human retinal imaging in patients with ages from 20s to 80s. We have established close working relationships with several leading eye hospitals and have imaged hundreds of patients. We anticipate to seek FDA 510k approval in the near future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/11/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hao&nbsp;Zhang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055379/1055379_10068877_1494478003377_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055379/1055379_10068877_1494478003377_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Visible-light optical coherence tomography in humans\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055379/1055379_10068877_1494478003377_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Visible-light optical coherence tomography in humans\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photograph of the latest human visible-light optical coherence tomography and retinal images acquired from patients at 38 and 88 years of ages.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Siyu Chen, Xiao Shu, Amani Fawzi, Hao F.
