  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnder Professor Okado\u00c6s mentorship, we wrote a program in Mathematica to study the scattering of solitons associated with the G2(1)-crystal, and proved a conjecture on the scattering rules of these solitions.  Solitons are \"solitary waves\" in clouds, in ocean waves, and in fundamental physics.\n\nUsing the theory of crystal bases, we found a previously unknown explicit solution (R-matrix) for the Yang-Baxter equation in statistical mechanics.  Crystal bases are a powerful tool for studying Lie group symmetries by relating them to associated discrete structures.  Using this, and a technique developed by Hatayama, Kuniba, and Takagi, we studied a new model of solitons associated with the Lie group G2(1) by a discrete model known as a cellular automaton.  We proved that solitons in this system are parameterized by elements of an A1(1) crystal base and that the scattering rule is the R-matrix for A1(1).  The scattering rule in this case is interesting because it leads to negative phase shift of a longer faster soliton colliding with a short slow soliton.  This is not observed except in the D4(1) and G2(1) cases.  Our paper-Soliton cellular automata associated with G2(1)-crystal base, is soon to appear in J. Math. Phys., and is on the web at www.arxiv.org 1109:2836.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Evan A Wilson"
