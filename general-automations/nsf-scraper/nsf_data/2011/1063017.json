 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year renewal REU Site program at the University of Pittsburgh is part of the Quality of Life Technology (QoLT) Engineering Research Center (ERC). The vision of the QoLT ERC is to transform the lives of people with reduced functional capabilities due to aging or disability through intelligent devices and systems. The QoLT ERC is a unique partnership between Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and Pittsburgh, integrating CMUs strength in the design, implementation, and technology transfer of intelligent systems, and Pitts' strength in health sciences and aging research.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this QoLT REU Site program are to: 1) Enroll a highly motivated and diverse group of undergraduate students and excite them about technology and engineering as disciplines and as tools to be influenced and authored, especially with respect to helping people and improving society; 2) Engage undergraduate students in cross-disciplinary research in QoLT to gain an understanding of how to relate human functions (physiological, physical, social and cognitive) to the design of intelligent devices and systems that aid and interact with people; 3) Increase the number of undergraduates who are well-prepared for graduate studies and professional careers in QoLT-related fields; and 4) Employ targeted recruitment efforts to achieve exemplary participation of underrepresented groups; in particular, students with disabilities and students from racial and ethnic minority groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe QoLT REU Site will place an emphasis on recruiting disadvantaged students in STEM (racial minorities, students with disabilities, and students from schools with limited research opportunities) and provide them with a comprehensive training experience. Students are expected to leave the program with a sense of excitement about technology and engineering, a critical mindset, and a deep understanding of the process of conducting QoLT research. Students will be active participants and innovators in projects designed to address real-world problems with systems-level engineering efforts. The students will think laterally and design real systems that make a difference in an intellectually and emotionally powerful way, which is the unique strength of the QoLT context.",
