 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on 3D image/video perception in the light of general principles of stereo\r\nprocessing in the human visual system is being used to derive 3D quality metrics for 3D\r\nvideo applications in order to deliver the best 3D experience.\r\n\r\nHuman observers can detect differences in depth with high sensitivity, but limited\r\nprecision. Moreover, while the visual system can represent fine details of the 2D image\r\nthat are carried by high spatial frequency components (even when the image is rapidly\r\nchanging), it can not track variations in depth with comparably high resolution in space\r\nor time. Thus the representation of stereoscopic depth is restricted both in bandwidth and\r\nin bit depth. Because of those limitations, some deviations from accuracy in the\r\nrepresentation of depth at the retinal level are perceptually salient, and others less so.\r\nMeasurements of perceived image fidelity across a range of spatial and temporal profiles\r\nfor the depth signal are being used to guide the development of optimal video processing\r\ntechniques, and to allow evaluation of the advantages and limitations of alternative 3D\r\nvideo coding algorithms such as multiview versus video+depth).\r\n\r\nVision experiments investigate both perceived fidelity and perceived image quality in 3D\r\nvideo generated using a variety of encoding schemes. From those results quality metrics\r\nare developed and integrated into video processing and communications applications. A\r\nhuman-centric disparity estimation and view synthesis algorithm is being developed for\r\nvideo processing and communications applications; this can also be used to improve the\r\nperformance of object detection, classification and tracking, and to generate multi views\r\nfor autostereoscopic display, which finds applications in 3D enabled diagnostic medical\r\nimaging and surgical systems.",
