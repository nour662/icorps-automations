In particular, the project aims develop ideas for research opportunities in sustainable energy pathways and to share these broadly.  The workshop will involve 15-20 participants from diverse fields, backgrounds, and career levels, and will produce a 5-10 page white paper on research opportunities in sustainable energy pathways that will be disseminated across the Earth surface research community.",
