 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance understanding of complexity in climate-societal dynamics by applying cyber-enabled multiagent systems models integrated with evolutionary computation algorithms. The research will develop, validate, and analyze new computational agent-based models as transformative tools for simulating human societies spatially situated in regions with diverse ecosystems and explicit climate dynamics. The new suite of models will focus on two geographic regions where climate change has significant consequences for humans and ecosystems: Sub-Saharan Africa (over a billion people at high risk of displacement, disease, starvation) and the Arctic Circumboreal region (where the fastest ecological changes are now occurring with shifting patterns comparable to earlier major climate events). \r\n\r\nThe project forges interdisciplinary collaboration among anthropologists, political scientists, earth scientists, and computer scientists to advance the science of complex adaptive systems.  The core intellectual merit of the project is its contribution to basic understanding of multiscale complexity in climate-society dynamics, by creating a cyber-enabled integrated computational framework for modeling, simulating, and exploring scenarios. Spatial multiagent systems will be created that include climate dynamics as well as other natural hazards and stressors with direct and indirect effects on social dynamics composed of households and governance institutions. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts from this project will include (1) new cross-disciplinary understanding of climate-society dynamics, (2) new computational tools; (3) new policy-relevant insights derived via scenario analysis with such tools; (4) innovations in new advanced forms of hybrid computational modeling, enabling new collaborations across disciplines; (5) new support for innovative forms of teaching, training, and learning through computational modeling of complex socio-ecological systems; (6) and multi-institutional opportunities for students from underrepresented groups via classroom visits and museum exhibits.  Perpetual archiving of all electronic materials (code and data) will be implemented through the Smithsonian data archiving initiative.",

The project was supported by the National Science Foundation's Cyber-enabled Discoveries and Innovation (CDI) Program, which focuses on generating innovative scientific knowledge through the medium of advanced computing. Scientists from many fields of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) participated in this investigation, utilizing historical and environmental data, scientific theories, and diverse methodologies, such as agent-based modeling, evolutionary computation, ethnographic field surveys, and geospatial tools, among others.

For example, a major product of this project was the creation of a data-calibrated, verified, and validated computer model that integrated the natural, the social, and the built environments in the northern part of the Earth's globe covering from approximately forty degrees north all the way up to the North Pole; in other words, the world's northern regions where most economic activity is located. A separate important result was also the creation of a similar computer model for a region of the Andes located in Peru (Huancayo region), where glaciers are melting and infrastructure systems and local populations (society, economy, and politics) are adversely affected. The creation of complex but insightful computational models in two regions that are so different in natural, social, and engineering features was a demonstration of the versatility of the convergent science and technology of complex adaptive systems being advanced by this project through closely coordinated and integrative interdisciplinary investigation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; An unexpected product of this project was the creation of a novel mathematical tool for more accurately analyzing and understanding the properties of complex systems that contain both continuous and discrete features. These hybrid systems are common in coupled natural-human-engineered systems, such as those existing in the northern boral and Arctic regions, so the new mathematical tool (a new calculus operator called \"nabladot\") promises to provide new exact results for detailed analyses that have been previously approximated by coarse methods. Initial presentations of the new operator to separate computer science and mathematics audiences have thus far been encouraging. Several challenging areas of application are being identified for in-depth analysis using the new operator.

Computational social science, in particular, is a fledging field with a bright future for meeting the challenges of understanding social complexity when coupled with natural and infrastructure systems in contemporary civilization.
