March 3, 2011\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  The proposal will support the attendance of up to 12 students at the Biological Materials Science Symposium held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Minerals, Metals, and Materials Society (TMS) in San Diego, February 27-March 3, 2011.  The symposium is specifically designed to include a large number of student presentations, both oral and poster.  A highlight of the symposium is the practice of awarding monetary prizes to the students who make the most impressive presentations.  The symposium presents a healthy mix of talks by established investigators and younger investigators, including students and postdoctorals.  It is particularly noteworthy for the large proportion of foreign scientists who will participate.  Argentina, Turkey, India, Korea, the Czech Republic, Pakistan, Canada, Mexico, Ireland, Japan, China, Germany, Singapore, and Brazil are all represented on the symposium program in addition to US scientists.  The symposium is divided into seven oral sessions that reflect the full range of activity supported by the NSF Biomaterials program.  It will last for four full days and include approximately 70 oral presentations.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  This symposium provides an unusual opportunity for biomaterials research students to meet one another and to mix with established scientists from around the world.  The possibility for so many students (20 or more students will be supported from all funding sources) to prepare for, present, and otherwise participate at a major international gathering will be extremely beneficial of their development as scientists.  Students to be offered support will be selected with appropriate attention to broadening participation by members of underrepresented groups.  In addition, established US scientists will benefit from the abundant opportunities the symposium will afford for international contacts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe intellectual merit of the 7th Biological Materials Science (BMS) Symposium held at the 2011 TMS Annual Meeting was to provide a unique venue for researchers exploring the intersection of materials science and biology.  Materials science and engineering is expected to play a highly significant role in the foreseeable future of biomedicine.  Conversely, noting that materials science finds its roots in physics and chemistry, biology is logically the next great frontier for materials science. \n\nBiological materials science refers to the application of materials science and engineering principles to the study of biological materials, including the design, synthesis and fabrication of materials systems from biological lessons.  The BMS Symposium is unique in emphasizing the primacy of biological materials to the development of biomaterials and biomimetic materials.  Biological materials comprise the inorganic and organic constituents of biological systems, whereas biomaterials are synthetic materials developed to replace, restore or augment biological materials. Biomimetic materials (or bioinspired materials) have unique, tailored structure and properties based upon the study of structure-property relationships in biological materials. \n\nThe broader impact of the 7th Biological Materials Science (BMS) Symposium held at the 2011 TMS Annual Meeting was to generate enthusiasm and interest amongst students in the field of biomaterials.  Student participation is a key to the future vitality of the scientific field of biological materials science.  Therefore, the organizers are committed to making this symposium a premier venue for student participants amongst materials or biomaterials focused professional societies.  The funds from this grant were used to support a student poster contest and student oral presenters with travel stipends to defray the ever-increasing costs of travel for student participants. Additional impacts were to facilitate interaction of students and junior investigators (e.g., untenured faculty) with senior investigators. The smaller size of the BMS Symposium within the TMS Annual Meeting, and in comparison to other related meetings on biomaterials, provided an environment conducive to informal interactions.
