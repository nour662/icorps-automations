I enjoyed these new friendships and cultural immersion my environment presented immensely. Despite working in my home laboratory, of which about ~40% originate from Asian countries\u00c6, living in Beijing was a totally unique experience that cannot be aptly understood unless one is there. There were so many unique events during my time there, some great, some unpleasant but overall I felt grateful to have the opportunity to observe a day to day life from a different point of view, yet still be productive. I found having an open mind was crucial, as many customs and behaviors are different or can seem strange, as one may expect. Though this does beg the question \"what is it that Americans do that is weird?\". Seeing a how other humans go through life lets one real..."
