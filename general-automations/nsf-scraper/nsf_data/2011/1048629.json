 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor John Dawson and colleagues Richard Adams, Sophya Garashchuk, Vitaly Rassolov and Linda Shimizu from University of South Carolina will acquire a computer cluster. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) chemistry of transition metal cluster complexes, (b) effects of zero-point energy on reactivity of methane, (c) spin properties of aromatic radicals, (d) porous nanoreactors from macrocyclic urea, and (e) synthesis and characterization of new complex photoluminescent oxides.\r\n\r\nA cluster of fast, modern computers is vital to serving the computing needs of active research departments. Such a \"computer network\" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing. The computing resource will permit research, research training, and research outreach opportunities the neighboring colleges such as Claflin University, USC Aiken, Newberry College, Allen University and Presbyterian College.",
