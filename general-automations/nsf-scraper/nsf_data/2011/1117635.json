 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goals of this project are to bring the technology of\r\nsoftware contracts to widely-used programming languages and, through\r\nthe use of manifest contracts, to provide software developers with a\r\nmigration path from simply typed code to fully functional correctness.\r\nSince computational effects are notoriously hard to reason about and\r\npervade even the simplest realistic programs, the proposed research\r\nshould have significant impact on programmers' ability to develop\r\nsoftware that is more reliable and more secure. \r\n\r\nContracts in software establish clear interfaces between program\r\ncomponents.  Like contracts in the legal realm, they delineate each\r\nparty's expectations and obligations.  Such contracts are becoming\r\nincreasingly important for the regulation of modern software systems,\r\nproviding an expressive framework for verification and error tracking.\r\nTo be effective in a software environment, contracts must have formal\r\nsemantics and must be supported by a monitoring system that precisely\r\ntracks the flow of values as they cross interfaces.  To date, however,\r\nthe formal study of contracts has mostly been limited to small\r\nidealized languages without computational effects, such as reading\r\ndata from or writing data to a display or file, managing resources\r\nsuch as memory, and performing probabilistic or speculative\r\ncomputation.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to extend the semantic framework of software\r\ncontracts to languages with various computational effects: the\r\nextension is qualitative in nature and will enable the use of\r\ncontracts in new application domains.  Specifically, the PIs propose\r\nto add support for computational effects to the two flavors of\r\ncontracts studied to date: latent contracts, which are runtime checks\r\nnot reflected in the type system, and manifest contracts, where a\r\nsystem of precise types records the most recent runtime check applied\r\nto each value.  The extension of latent contracts will be done in the\r\ncontext of a monadic met language.  The extension of manifest\r\ncontracts will make use of a variant of Hoare Type Theory to precisely\r\nrecord computational effects.  The PIs will also implement prototype\r\nsystems and use them to present novel applications of software\r\ncontracts.",
