 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching goal of this United States-New Zealand workshop on geothermal systems is to bring together researchers and industry representatives from New Zealand with senior and junior researchers and graduate students from US institutions, with the goal of forming long-term funding partnerships and research collaborations.  The workshop will consist of the following five key activities: \r\n      A.\tIt will provide a venue for industry to educate researchers on their needs and the \r\n          challenges of characterizing, monitoring, and managing hydrothermal reservoirs; \r\n      B.\tResearchers will be given the opportunity to present their own research and \r\n          discuss how it may be useful for the investigation of hydrothermal systems; \r\n      C.\tBoth researchers and industry representatives will offer their ideas regarding \r\n          future challenges in the study of hydrothermal systems; \r\n      D.\tRepresentatives of potential funding venues (e.g., industry, NSF, DOE) will be \r\n          invited to explain their funding priorities and to discuss how workshop \r\n          participants can become involved; \r\n      E.\tWorkshop participants will collaborate on the development of a proceedings that \r\n          will be available for broad distribution to the US and NZ communities\r\nThese activities will take place within a framework of professional talks, moderated panel discussions, informal group interaction, and a one-day field trip.  During the final day of the workshop, breakout groups will outline and draft the series of white papers that will form the basis of the workshop proceedings. \r\n \r\nThis joint NZ-US workshop will be held at the Mighty River Power Rotorua Campus.  It will be an important venue for acquainting US researchers with the work in progress in New Zealand, for making researcher-industry contacts, and for showcasing current US research in hydrothermal systems and EGS to New Zealand academics and industry representatives.  The workshop also offers a training opportunity for students at US academic institutions. In addition to the training these students may receive, they will have the opportunity to meet a broad spectrum of hydrothermal and EGS researchers from the US, NZ, academia and industry.  These interactions will provide a powerful means of energizing student interest in geothermal research, and may prove formative for these students? careers.  It is also envisioned that several collaborative proposals on geothermal energy exploration and utilization will be developed and submitted to funding agencies in the US and New Zealand.",
