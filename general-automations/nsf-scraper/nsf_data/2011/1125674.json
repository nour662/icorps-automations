 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grant in Engineering (BRIGE) provides funding for the development of low-environmental impact polymer to coat nanoscale particles for groundwater remediation. Plant-based polymers will be modified and their structure-property relationships will be studied to understand the impacts of various functional groups on dispersion, contaminant treatability, aquifer injectability, and subsurface mobility of coated nanoscale zero-valent iron particles. The results obtained from the experiments will be used to fine-tune the final architecture of biopolymers to coat the particles.  The overall objective of this research is to study the impacts of manipulation of the biopolymer functional groups on dispersion, contaminant degradation, and transport behaviors of the coated iron particles as well as biodegradability of the polymer coatings.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will lead to the development of smarter and low-impact groundwater remediation tools which will benefit practitioners in environmental remediation. The findings from this research will elucidate the impacts of polymer architecture on aquifer transport of polymer coated nanomaterials. The biodegradation studies are expected to lead to the development of new polymer biodegradation test protocols and help in better understanding the degradation behavior of complex engineered nanomaterials in an aquatic environment. This research project will add to the body of knowledge in environmental engineering, polymer science, and nanotechnology as well in biomedical science. The biodegradable polymers synthesized within this project may find uses in drug and nutrient delivery in human and plants. The project will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (Native Americans, first generation Americans, and women) in fundamental research. The high school students recruited for research in this project are expected to pursue higher education and careers in science and engineering. Programs organized among Native American middle/high school students and students with disabilities will help in inculcating the spirit of scientific research among them.",
