 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to explore the realization and study the performance of a multiband imaging receiver system that potentially provides the highest available heterodyne detection sensitivity in the frequency range of 1-3 THz. The approach is to integrate a pair of identical superconducting hot-electron bolometers (HEBs) into a dual-polarization sinuous antenna to form a quasi-optical balanced mixer configuration. To further reduce the system noise, a superconducting microwave hybrid will be integrated for IF output. THz multi-band/reconfigurable frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) will also be explored to be employed in the receiver system. The research program consists of detailed design, simulation, development, and experimental demonstration of prototype receivers operating in the sub-millimeterwave through THz regimes.    \r\n\t\r\nThe program's intellectual merit centers on the challenges and opportunities offered by integrating two HEBs into a sinuous antenna to realize a high performance receiver system suitable for multiband THz detection and imaging applications. The ultra-low system noise and multi-frequency operation are achieved by novel approaches of quasi-optical balanced mixer configuration, the integration of superconducting IF hybrids and the utilization of multiband/tunable THz FSSs. Advances in THz devices, circuits design and integration technology are expected. Insights gained may be transferrable to other THz detection and imaging technologies.\r\n\t\r\nThe broader impacts include both the creation of new scientific/engineering knowledge, as well as contributions to university education. In addition to the THz community, this work will benefit a wide range of science disciplines such as astronomy, atmospheric physics, chemical/biological sensing, and medical diagnostics. The graduate students in this program will be exposed to the full scope of the system design process, from devices to the system level. Undergraduates will be involved through summer and honors thesis research.",

Because of that, engineers and scientists have intensified their efforts to build THz detectors, mixers and receivers for operation in the THz frequency range in recent years. Receivers based on superconducting hot-electron bolometers (HEBs) offer the advantages of high sensitivity, low noise and low LO power requirement. However, single-element HEB mixers may suffer from noise introduced by LO injection and vibration. Consequently, balanced mixer designs are of great interest since the thermal noise and amplitude modulation noise from the LO can be suppressed. In this research, two high performance HEB devices have been integrated into lens-coupled dual-polarization sinuous antennas (with an airbridge) for quasi-optical balanced mixer configurations to gain the advantages of both ultra-high sensitivity and extremely-broad bandwidth. Tunable and reconfigurable THz filter structures and technologies have also been pursued to enable multiband mixer operation.</p>\n<p>For THz balanced mixer architectures and design, a broadband lens-coupled sinuous antenna with dual-polarization has been fully studied and characterized. Simulation results have shown that this kind of antenna could be applied for covering an ultrabroad bandwidth from 100 GHz to 5 THz, with nearly frequency-independent embedding impedance of ~100 &Omega;. Near-Gaussian radiation patterns with more than 15 dB isolation between two polarizations have been demonstrated in the 200 GHz and 585 GHz frequency bands. For superconducting HEB device and circuit fabrication, high quality niobium thin films with typical critical temperature approaching 8 K have been deposited at the University of Notre Dame (ND) with the assistance from the University of Virginia (UVa) team. Using these films, nm-scale working HEB devices have been demonstrated (as shown in Fig. 1). An independent and unique HEB fabrication process compatible with the ND facilities has been developed that permit the direct integration of two HEBs into planar sinuous antennas with an airbridge for balanced configuration (Fig. 2). In order to fully characterize the balanced HEB mixers, a low-temperature cooling procedure, a cryogenic dewar system (see Fig. 3) and Y-factor measurement setup have been established at ND. Initial characterization results at 585 GHz have shown that promising mixer performance can be expected. Besides the HEB balanced mixers, frequency tunable antennas in G-band (140-220 GHz) have also been first demonstrated using Schottky varactor diodes (in collaboration with the UVa team, see Fig. 4).
