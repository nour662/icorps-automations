 "awd_abstract_narration": "In collaboration with Arizona State University at the West campus (ASU West), Glendale Community College (GCC) is integrating the use of an NMR spectrometer and other instrumentation with a pedagogical change to hands-on experiences across organic chemistry and biotechnology. This combination is establishing a strong foundational STEM educational program that improves the quality of student preparedness for industry and four-year degree programs. Specifically, the objectives are: \r\n1. To bridge chemistry and biotechnology curricula by creating courses that focus on parallel instrumentation, other laboratory technical skills, and pedagogical changes that include hands-on use of the instrumentation. \r\n2. To immerse community college students in the university research environment by leveraging GCC's partnership with ASU West. This partnership provides students with a clear route for entry into four-year degree programs and is expected to increase the future success of the students in the pursuit and attainment of advanced degrees. \r\n3. To create an assessment loop that focuses on the links between student success and the exposure of students to instrumentation and to revised instructional pedagogy. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit.  Because of the small class size and high faculty to student ratio, GCC is an ideal setting in which to maximize student exposure to hands-on, active-participation strategies in the learning process, and to assess pedagogical techniques. GCC students are gaining from valuable and extensive experience on both academic and research grade instrumentation using up-to-date pedagogical techniques. They also are given opportunities for professional development through a unique program that exposes them to the ASU West research environment, research dissemination, and potential academic, government and industry careers. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  GCC is one of ten community colleges in the Maricopa County Community College District (MCCD), one of the largest community college districts in the world. The GCC student population is highly diverse with 33% (of which 24.9% are Hispanic) of the students being members of groups underrepresented in STEM fields. Thus, the project is serving underrepresented groups including those from low socioeconomic backgrounds and first-generation college students.  The alliance with ASU West is creating a pipeline for GCC students to enter STEM fields, and is preparing them for baccalaureate and graduate studies.  The project serves as a national model of using complementary instruments to develop a synergistic and transformative partnership between a Community College and a University. \r\n\r\nA rigorous evaluative program is documenting student understanding of instrumentation when integrated with hands-on pedagogy as well as attitude changes as a result of this project. The faculty involved will disseminate the results of the project through publications in relevant peer-reviewed journals and by presentations at appropriate conferences. They also are conducting workshops with the intent of aggressively encouraging adoption of this project at other MCCCD colleges, especially those already equipped with an NMR instrument.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTo increase the self-confidence of students working with technology and to increase the number of undergraduates pursuing careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, a partnership has been developed between Glendale Community College (GCC) and Arizona State University West (ASU West).  This partnership features curriculum changes, hands-on use of sophisticated technology, and exposure of students to undergraduate research opportunities.\n\n \n\nCurricular changes at GCC include the following:\n\n-       For the Organic Chemistry 1 laboratory class (CHM 235LL), three out of ten of the experiments now utilize hands-on operation of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n\n-       For the Organic Chemistry 2 laboratory class (CHM 236LL), six out of seven of the experiments use NMR spectroscopy.\n\n-       Advanced Lab Instrumentation (BIO 210) now features the use of NMR spectroscopy.  This combined lecture/laboratory course is inherently inquiry-based and interdisciplinary.  Students work on independent projects throughout the semester, utilizing various suitable technologies to analyze their results.  Available technologies include infrared (IR) spectroscopy, gas chromatography (GC), and now NMR spectroscopy.  Past projects have included studies of unique organisms such as Deinococcus hopiensis, a local bacteria that has the ability to survive dessication.\n\n-       Regular visits to ASU West are now an integral part of Organic Chemistry 2 labs.  Students prepare their own samples and analyze them on both GCC\u00c6s 60-MHz NMR and ASU West\u00c6s higher field 400-MHz NMR.  While at ASU West the students not only learn more about NMR technology but also about the research opportunities available at ASU West.  In addition, the students learn to operate a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.\n\n \n\nNMR spectroscopy is a necessity in organic chemistry.  GCC students now have the ability to become proficient in the use of a 60-MHz NMR instrument and become familiar with 400-MHz NMR (through ASU West).  During the course of this project, GCC converted an existing space into a dedicated instrumentation lab, currently housing NMR, GC, and IR instruments.  Use of these instruments on a regular basis as part of most lab experiments allows students to become comfortable working in a research environment.\n\n \n\nTo help and encourage community college students to transfer to advanced programs of study, this project has established a close relationship between GCC and ASU West:\n\n-       The class visits to ASU West are now part of the regular schedule for our CHM 236LL laboratory classes.  In addition to learning about and using instruments at ASU West, students learn about undergraduate research options at ASU West, such as NCUIRE (New College Undergraduate Inquiry and Research Experiences Program)\n\n-       At the end of the semester, students are invited to present the results of their projects at symposia held at ASU West.  Students have the opportunity to network with current ASU West students, some who are former GCC students, and ASU West professors.  During panel discussions held at these symposia, students have learned from ASU West students, industry representatives, and advising personnel.\n\n-       As the symposia have grown, students from several different classes at GCC have had the opportunity to present their projects, notably Organic Chemistry, Advanced Lab Instrumentation, and Fundamental Biochemistry.\n\n-       As the project has matured another venue for student presentations and even more networking has been identified for GCC students, ASU West\u00c6s Student Research and Creative Projects Expo.  This event attracts current undergraduate researchers from the universities and GCC students have a greater opportunity to learn about new and different research possibilities. https://newcollege.asu.edu/events-at-asu-new-college/student-research-and-creative-projects-expo\n\n \n\nContinuous assessment has been established to measur..."
