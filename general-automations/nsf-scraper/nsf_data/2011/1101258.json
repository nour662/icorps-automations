 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continued funding for the researcher's effort to acquire high-resolution radiosonde data for the United States for use in research on atmospheric turbulence, gravity waves, and the tropopause.  While most publicly available US radiosonde data is provided at widely spaced standard pressure levels and a few \"significant levels\", the raw data has traditionally been archived every 6 seconds, implying a vertical resolution of about 30m.  The US National Weather Service is now archiving raw data at one second intervals, so recent data is archived at roughly 5m vertical resolution.  This project will use the high-resolution data to conduct research in two areas: studies of turbulent layering in the troposphere above the boundary layer and in the lower stratosphere, and the role of gravity wave breaking in establishing the turbulent layers; and studies of the physical processes that form and maintain the extratropical tropopause.\r\n\r\nThe research has broader impacts for the scientific community by providing estimates for the parameters commonly used in parameterization schemes for gravity waves and turbulence in weather and climate models.  In addition, the high-resolution data is made available to the scientifc community through the researcher's website, and the researcher will organize a workshop to help other researchers understand and use the data.  The project also supports a graduate student and a postdoc, thereby providing for the next generation of scientists in the field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere were three distinct aspects to this project.  One was to acquire and disseminate US high vertical-resolution radiosonde data.  This was done very successfully.  The data from 1998-2011 can be freely accessed hrough the SPARC Data Center.  Furthermore, the wide use of these data that resulted from this NSF grant motivated NOAA to make these data freely available in the future.  Secondly, we performed research on atmospheric gravity waves and turbulence.  We presented an example of the type of unique information on atmospheric turbulence that could be derived from high vertical-resolution radiosonde data if one followed the suggestion of a universal realtion between the Thorpe and Ozmidov scales.  In collaboration with GATS, Inc. colleagues, we showed modeling results that indicated that there was no such universal relation.  Rather, the relation between the Thorpe and Ozmidov scales changes depending on the evolution of the turbulence event from initiation to its dying out.  It also depends on the initiating type of the turbulence (i. e., wave breaking, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, or intrusion event initiation).  This motivated us to submit a successful proposal to the NSF to investigate what kind of averaging is necessary to derive quantitative infromation on turbulence from high vertical-resolution radiosonde data.  Thirdly, we carried out a succession of observational and modeling works that established mixing of Ertel Potential vorticity by the action of baroclinic eddies as the principal mechanism for establishing and maintaining the sharpness of the extratropical tropopause.  In addition to these three outcomes, other research carried out established the viability of using IGRA (International Global Radiosonde Archive) data as a surrogate for high vertical-resolution data for long-term records of the QBO (quasi-biennial oscillation).  We then used used such long-term data records to demonstrate that the ENSO (El Nino/Southern Oscillation) influence on the QBO was diffrerent before the mid-1980s than it was after about 1990.  This was shown to have an important influence on the QBO modulation of the cold-point tropopause.  By means of cloud-resolving modeling, we also demonstrated that the QBO can influence tropical deep convection and resulting rainfall.  We showed that to get an effect comparable to that indicated by observations, one must include the interaction between the convection and the larger-scale circulation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/16/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marvin A Geller"
