 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a key technology for the digital age. At the core of most NLP systems is a parser, a program which identifies the grammatical structure of sentences. Parsing is an essential prerequisite for language understanding. But despite significant progress in recent decades, accurate wide-coverage parsing for any genre or language remains an unsolved problem. The broader impact of this CAREER project will be to advance the state of art in NLP technology through the development of more accurate statistical parsing models.  \r\n\r\nSince language is highly ambiguous, parsers require a statistical model which assigns the highest probability to the correct structure of each sentence.  The accuracy of current parsers is limited by the amount of available training data on which their models can be trained, and by the amount of information the models take into account. This CAREER project aims to advance parsing by developing novel methods of indirect supervision to overcome the lack of labeled training data, as well as new kinds of models which incorporate information about the prior linguistic context in which sentences appear. It employs Bayesian techniques, which give robust estimates and allow rich parametrization, and applies them to lexicalized grammars, which provide a compact representation of the syntactic properties of a language.\r\nThis CAREER project will also train graduate students in natural language processing and develop materials that can be used to teach middle and high school students about NLP  and to inspire them to pursue an education in computer science.",

The use of CCG has provided us with several advantages over other approaches for unsupervised grammar induction: 1) we were able to show that CCG permits a much simpler statistical model for unsupervised induction than context-free or dependency grammars (in fact, our model is as simple as that for finite-state Hidden-Markov Models, even though those are even less expressive than context-free grammars); 2) our parser is much more robust (accurate) on longer sentences, 3) our approach returns linguistically interpretable analyses that identify head-argument and head-modifier relations between words and constituents, making it potentially directly useful for any downstream applications that require syntactic analyses, 4) the linguistic interpretability of our system's parses has made it possible for us to perform an extensive error analysis of the kinds of constructions that can or cannot be identified correctly without supervision, and 5) we were also able to show that the output of our syntactic parser can be used either under its original unsupervised training regime, or when provided with additional weak supervision for semantic parsing in the same fashion as a supervised CCG parser can.
