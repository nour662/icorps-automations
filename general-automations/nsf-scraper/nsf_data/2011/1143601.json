 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\n\r\nIn an increasingly interconnected world, study of the forces that shape state behavior and\r\ninteractions is increasingly essential. Building on previous success of this program since 2004,\r\nthe Democracy, Interdependence and World Politics Summer Research Program at Texas\r\nChristian University in Fort Worth, Texas will be held in the summers of 2012 and 2013. Within\r\nthe overall project theme students devise and complete independent, mentored research\r\nprojects on issues with significant academic and popular value. Each year, 7 students will work\r\nwith faculty mentors to develop research projects, gather and analyze data and produce\r\nscholarly papers reporting their findings. Activities include research methods seminars, intensive\r\nproject development workshops, presentations by guest scholars, community events, and\r\nresearch under the guidance of project mentors with established records of research and\r\npublication. Unlike most REU programs, the focus on international relations and independent,\r\nfaculty-mentored student projects, and extensive research training.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nRecent geo-political events and the global spread of democracy make studying democracy?s\r\nconsequences for world politics compelling. Key concerns include the ability of democracies to\r\nformulate and sustain successful foreign policies, the prospects and implications of\r\ndemocratization and democracy promotion, and the effect of democracy on violent conflict.\r\nBecause this project promotes undergraduate research into these timely areas of study, it builds\r\non growing areas of inquiry in world politics. High quality student research projects examine\r\ncritical factors impacting state behavior and interactions, and are disseminated publicly through\r\npresentation at the annual International Studies Association meetings, with whom the program\r\nwill partner to ensure dissemination and impact for the projects. Moreover, student participants\r\nare highly likely to go on to graduate study, for which they are substantially better prepared\r\nbecause of the intensive training of the summer program.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThis unique program expands national understanding of undergraduate education in Political\r\nScience, which has limited examples of undergraduate student-faculty collaborative research.\r\nSecond, the program provides meaningful opportunities to students to engage in international\r\nstudies research and contribute research projects to the discipline?s discourse. Third, consistent\r\nwith NSF principles emphasizing the positive impact of mentored research on undergraduate\r\neducation, the program develops and enhances research skills and prepares students for\r\ngraduate study and other applications. Fourth, the program enables diverse students from\r\ndifferent regions and institutions of the country to challenge and support each other in a cohort.\r\nFinally, by offering a competitive stipend, this project is accessible to students from middle and\r\nlower economic strata as a summer employment opportunity that enriches their education.",
