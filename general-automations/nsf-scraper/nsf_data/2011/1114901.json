The proposed\r\nnovel computational methods for inverting this accurate image formation \r\nmodel for SXM are designed to improve the resolution in the reconstructions of the \r\nthree-dimensional (3D) structures from their SXM projections.  It is conjectured \r\nthat such a treatment will result in improved accuracy and usefulness as \r\ncompared to the currently used heuristic procedures. \r\n\r\nIn many areas of biology, the understanding of a 3D structure provides a way \r\nof understanding its function. Many structures, such as single molecules, \r\nviruses, cells, etc., are too small to be viewed with the naked eye. \r\nMicroscopy has been providing images with information about\r\ndetails of these structures. However, unprocessed microscopic images \r\npresent structures that are superimposed over each other, making\r\nthem hard to interpret.
