 "awd_abstract_narration": "The St. Louis STEM Scholars (S3) Academy is designed to increase the number of financially needy students seeking degrees in six science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The goal is to prepare students so they may complete associate degrees, matriculate to four-year institutions, and enter the STEM workforce. Experienced faculty and staff and industry partners support student recruitment and career placement and select sixteen S3 Academy scholarship recipients each year. \r\n\r\nThis five-year project continues successful practices by:  \r\n(1) Increasing the number of students receiving degrees in biotechnology, chemical technology, computer science, engineering science, engineering technology, and mathematics. \r\n(2) Increasing the academic success of S3 Academy students compared to non-S3 Academy students. \r\n(3) Increasing the number of women, racial and ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities in the S3 Academy as compared to STEM students at the college. \r\n(4) Maintaining the S3 Academy community. \r\n(5) Strengthening college partnerships with academic and industrial STEM leaders. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project advances knowledge and understanding within six STEM fields by providing scholarships and multiple support services, thereby increasing number of students studying and succeeding in these high-quality academic programs at the college. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The project prepares S3 Academy students to participate as scientists working together on task forces to solve problems; communicate effectively; and learn lifelong skills adaptable to workplace changes. The S3 Academy opens doors that otherwise would remain closed to many students. Through dissemination, the college aims to make the S3 Academy a model program for replication at community colleges nationwide.",

(Initially, the first six degree programs were included in the S<sup>3</sup> Academy Scholarship Program. Computer Integrated Manufacturing was added in 2014 because the Chemical Technology and Mathematics degree programs were no longer available at STLCC-FV.) Academic success was measured in two ways: 1) by S<sup>3</sup> Academy students sustaining, on average, academic performance of better than 2.5 GPA (required to qualify) throughout the project period; and 2) by comparing retention to completion (students who graduated in their declared majors or matriculated to four-year colleges/universities) for S<sup>3</sup> Academy scholars with overall retention to completion of non-S<sup>3</sup> Academy declared STEM majors in the same programs for the same period.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">First, academic performance of S<sup>3</sup> Academy scholars during the 2011 through 2018 grant period showed average GPAs by declared major ranged from 2.78 to 3.53 on a 4.0 scale, with an overall average of 3.21. By comparison, STEM majors in these disciplines who were not part of the S<sup>3</sup> Academy showed average GPAs ranging from 2.38 to 2.95 with an overall average of 2.66. Second, overall retention rate for the seven STEM majors at STLCC-FV over the grant period was 47% while that of the S<sup>3</sup> Academy scholars was 57%.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\"><strong>Broader Impacts </strong></p>\n<p class=\"Default\"><em>Proposal: Preparing S<sup>3</sup> Academy students to participate as scientists working together on task forces to solve problems; communicating effectively; and learning lifelong skills adaptable to workplace changes. The S<sup>3</sup> Academy opens doors that otherwise would remain closed to these St. Louis area students.<br /></em></p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The broader impact of the S<sup>3</sup> Academy is that academically talented but financially needy students were helped to be successful in STEM fields. Success can be defined by the number of students who graduate, matriculate to four year colleges/universities, or get a job in the STEM field and 57% of S<sup>3</sup> Academy scholars did so. All S<sup>3</sup> Academy scholars were financially needy as defined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid; 49% were African American (39% African American males); 6% were Asian; 41% were Caucasian; and 10% had documented disabilities. Overall, 40% of male STEM students at STLCC-FV were African American. However, for the S<sup>3</sup> Academy, 57% of male students were African American. Of all the S<sup>3</sup> Academy scholars, 31% were female while the percent of female STEM students compared to all STEM students at STLCC-FV was 22%.</p>\n<p>The S<sup>3</sup> Academy used innovative techniques to help our students succeed. Two practices that helped our S<sup>3</sup> Academy scholars most were continuous monitoring of academic work and an active S<sup>3</sup> Academy learning community. Instructors completed progress reports on each scholar every 4 weeks and the S<sup>3</sup> Academy management team members talked to scholars frequently in order to keep them on track and facilitate tutoring, when needed. A campus club, the St. Louis STEM Scholars Organization, was formed as the learning community for S<sup>3</sup> Academy scholars. The club met monthly and did fundraising to support non-local field trips. The camaraderie and interaction with club sponsors (PI and co-PIs) provided frequent opportunities for scholars to discuss problems and successes. At monthly meetings, S<sup>3</sup> Academy scholars decided on locations for field trips to STEM businesses and work sites, such as the construction site of the newest Mississippi River bridge, a coal-burning power plant, an automobile manufacturing facility, a biotechnology company's seed chipping robotics group, a forensic lab, a corn-to-ethanol company, and visits to Kennedy Space Center, Florida and the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. S<sup>3</sup> Academy scholars also visited universities (UMC Research Reactor, Missouri S&amp;T, SIU-E, and Washington University-St. Louis) and participated in events hosted by professional organizations (St. Louis Engineers' Club, National Society of Black Engineers, Mathematics Educators of Greater St. Louis, Missouri Mathematical Association of Two Year Colleges, and League of Innovation STEMtech).</p>\n<p>By volunteering at local events, such as the Engineering and Pi Day activities at the St. Louis Science Center and the Missouri STEM Summit, S<sup>3</sup> Academy scholars were able to share information about the NSF funded program at STLCC-FV. S<sup>3</sup> Academy scholars also assisted the PI in presenting information about the NSF S-STEM Scholarship Program and their academic achievements at in-state regional and national conferences.</p>\n<p>The STEM Division faculty and staff, the student support services of St. Louis Community College at Florissant Valley, and the PI and co-PIs personally invested in the success of our S<sup>3</sup> Academy scholars.
