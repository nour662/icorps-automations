 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigators from Northern Kentucky University and California State University Fullerton are designing a series of integrated laboratory activities that scaffold students' development of cognitive skills to support conceptual understanding in chemistry. More specifically, the laboratory activities target cognitive skills specific to inquiry-based learning in the laboratory, and target the abilities of students to transform concepts between macroscopic, particulate and symbolic representations. The laboratory instructional materials focus on four concept domains in first-term general chemistry: physical and chemical change, stoichiometry, solutions, and gases. Laboratory activities are being developed using a Learning Continuum Framework which describes a developmental progression of cognitive and conceptual learning objectives scaffolded across the three inquiry approaches of structured, guided and open. The research studies relationships between cognitive skills and conceptual development in the first-term chemistry laboratory. A focus of the research will be on how students develop the capacity to interpret, develop and refine mental models that bridge between particulate and macroscopic level perspectives. The results of the research will provide practical guidance on the nature and degree of scaffolding necessary for development of cognitive skills and the nexus between conceptual learning and mental model development. Implementation of the laboratory activities is being studied at both higher education institutions in order to include students with diverse backgrounds, on the rationale that this increases generalizability and transferability of the study's findings. Replications of the laboratory activities are being sought and carried out at two- and four-year colleges across the U.S. Fully replicated laboratory activities are being shared on a free website, along with a blog reporting current research efforts, list of research questions and feedback points.",

Integrated lab activities at the Structured Inquiry (SI) level for each of the four concept domains and one integrated lab activity at the Guided Inquiry (GI) level were developed, piloted and implemented. Each lab activity consists of a Pre Lab, Procedures, Interim Assignment and Skill Development Questions, and Lab Report. The Pre Lab and Interim Assignment may be delivered online. One additional lab activity was developed, piloted and implemented to assist students with skills to perform basic data analysis tasks using common spreadsheet applications and free online document sharing tools to make distributed data possible.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Intellectual merit of proposed activity</em></strong></p>\n<p>The effectiveness of the link between cognitive skills and conceptual development in the context of the chemistry laboratory, the nature and degree of scaffolding that support laboratory activities in Si and GI styles, and the manner in which learners develop their capacity to develop and use models that bridge the particulate and macroscopic worlds were explored. Baseline in Spring 2012 revealed that 67.5% of the students were able to write a complete variable name for a temperature measurement that included a property and object, while only 55.0% of the responses for mass were considered complete. For both mass and temperature measurements the percent of complete responses increased to at least 89% for mass and 76% for temperature in Fall 2012 and Spring 2013 after completion of the first SI lab (Figure 1). Students were asked to select the appropriate model of an ionic solid when provided a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) schematic representation. For KCl, 73.0% of the students selected the correct 2D representation, while 41.0% selected the correct 3D representation (<em>t</em>=3.41, <em>df</em>=121, <em>p</em>&pound;0.05). For KClO<sub>3</sub>, 74.0% of the students selected the correct 2D representation, while 59.0% selected the correct 3D representation <em>t</em>=1.44, <em>df</em>=121, <em>p</em>&pound;0.05). The statistically significant increase in selection when the stimulus models were given in two dimensions is congruent with the differences in cognitive demand required to deal with 2D and 3D representations (Figure 2). The ability to identify a linear pattern in a graph improved over the course of an SI laboratory activity (<em>t</em>=3.01, <em>df</em>=89, <em>p</em>&le;0.05, n=90). There was also a significant correlation between the selection of graphs as linear and nonlinear relationships and the quality of graph construction (<em>r</em>=0.27, <em>p</em>&le;0.05; <em>r</em>=0.28, <em>p</em>&le;0.05). A significant relationship between selection of the relationship depicted on the graph and correct selection of the model for an ionic solid for a precipitation reaction was also found (<em>&chi;2</em>=4.54, <em>p</em>&le;0.05, n=90) (Figure 3). An implication of this result is that explicit linking of pictorial and graphic representations appears to improve conceptual understanding. The nature of students' ability to make predictions about the relationship between pressure and volume in an ideal was explored in the GAS-SI lab activity. Of 61 students, 76.3% made an incorrect prediction on a Pre Lab item. After completing both weeks of the lab, the number of incorrect responses on a similar item decreased to 51.8%. The trend indicates that the SI lab had an impact on their understanding of Boyle&rsquo;s Law. A study on the efficacy of SI and GI labs in identification of independent, dependent, control and ancillary variables in the context of acid-base neutralization reactions resulted in a non-statistically significant trend of a greater mean percent frequency correct for the GI lab for all four variable types. There was a statistically significant increase in mean frequency of correct identification of the independent, dependent and control variables from Pre Lab to Interim Assignment to Lab Report (<em>t </em>=7.40, <em>df </em>= 216; <em>p </em>&le; 0.05; <em>t </em>= 6.02, <em>df </em>= 216, <em>p </em>&le; 0.05; <em>t </em>= 2.31, <em>df </em>= 216, <em>p </em>&le; 0.05). The data indicate that both forms of inquiry labs help students to improve their ability to identify independent, dependent and ancillary variables from interim to lab report (Figure 4).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity</em></strong></p>\n<p>A Learning Continuum framework was developed to design the activities and serve as a model for others to develop materials that can impact student learning across STEM disciplines (Figures 5-6). The framework may be adapted to other contexts. The project&rsquo;s economically and geographically diverse undergraduates subjects, provided important insight on the transferability of the project to other institutions. Over 700 undergraduates, fourteen undergraduate research assistants, nine graduate teaching assistants, and one master&rsquo;s candidate were directly impacted by the project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/13/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Barbara&nbsp;L&nbsp;Gonzalez</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1044049/1044049_10119393_1487039892222_Figure6LearningContinuumConceptual--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1044049/1044049_10119393_1487039892222_Figure6LearningContinuumConceptual--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 6 Learning Continuum Conceptual\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1044049/1044049_10119393_1487039892222_Figure6LearningContinuumConceptual--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 6 Learning Continuum Conceptual\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A Learning Continuum is a model to help design instructional activities with an emphasis on scaffolding conceptual understanding of chemistry that works in tandem with the cognitive continuum.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Monteyne, K. and Gonzalez, B.
