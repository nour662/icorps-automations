 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the interaction between set theory and C*-algebras.\r\nThe primary goal is to settle old outstanding open problems using set\r\ntheoretic tools, which could involve proving independence results.\r\nSpecific problems that could be addressed include the following: Naimark's problem\r\nabout the existence of nontrivial C*-algebras with only one irreducible\r\nrepresentation; Anderson's conjecture about pure states restricting to\r\npure states on diagonal masas; the Kadison-Singer problem that has many\r\nequivalent formulations and is significant to several areas of mathematics;\r\nthe Stone-Weierstrass problem about the existence of proper subalgebras\r\nthat separate pure states; the problem of Brown, Douglas, and Fillmore\r\nabout the existence of an automorphism of the Calkin algebra taking the\r\nimage of the unilateral shift to its adjoint; and Arveson's problem about\r\nthe existence of sufficiently many boundary representations for\r\nnonseparable operator systems.\r\n\r\nC*-algebras, a class of mathematical structures that were originally\r\nstudied primarily for applications in physics, have over time found\r\nsubstantial applications in a broad variety of areas of both mathematics\r\nand physics. Much current work in this field focuses on developing\r\nfurther connections to these other areas, but fundamental questions of\r\nbasic theory remain open.  In the past decade a series of long-standing\r\nopen problems in C*-algebras have been settled using, in an essential way,\r\ntechniques from the seemingly unrelated area of set theory. This was a\r\nsurprising connection that has enriched both fields.  Further work in\r\nthis direction is expected to lead to a better understanding of C*-algebras \r\nat a fundamental level.",
