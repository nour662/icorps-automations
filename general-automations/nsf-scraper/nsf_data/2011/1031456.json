 "awd_abstract_narration": "SCI-TALKS (Supporting Community Initiatives for Teaching, Learning, and Knowing Science), an ITEST strategies project, is designed to deliver after-school energy and environment (EE) education programs in community settings for rural low-income upper elementary students in West Virginia. The goal of SCI-TALKS is to provide pre-service and in-service teachers with professional development and technology resources to ensure that their students build workforce readiness skills through EE education program. Through guided inquiry, pre-service teachers will focus on developing \"science\" habits of mind. SCI-TALKS will impact 300 students and 88 educators. The project will foster the local community connections to implement the program effectively.\r\n   \r\nSCI-TALKS will utilize two primary sources for curriculum: 1) the National Energy Education Development energy curriculum to support Appalachian students and teachers on the necessity of proper stewardship of energy and its use and 2) PASCO Elementary School Introductory Science Experiments with PASCO's SPARK system probeware to provide students with tools to collect authentic measurements, design experiments, and develop a sense of scientific curiosity about their world.  Pre and post test data will be collected on student outcomes and compared to the data from the comparison groups. Active partnerships with local STEM industry, managed regionally by the Workforce Investment Board, will be maintained. The evaluation of the SCI-TALKS project will be conducted by an external evaluator with expertise in evaluation of after-school programs.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Marshall University, in a partnership with West Virginia State University, received a three-year ITEST strategies grant to partner pre-service teachers with in-service teachers to provide engaging student-centered science instruction for elementary students in the after-school setting. The program was titled SCI-TALKS (Supporting Community Initiatives for TeAching, Learning, and Knowing Science) primarily to provide focus on student dialogue, through Science Talks, to improve student interest and learning in science. As part of SCI-TALKS, two universities in West Virginia implemented two types of elementary methods courses in an attempt to better prepare future elementary teachers in science. One elementary methods course incorporated SCI-TALKS which provided 15 after-school science lessons to local at-risk elementary students. Another methods course was offered to similar elementary pre-service teachers which incorporated a traditional observation clinical experience in local elementary schools to serve as a comparison group. The SCI-TALKS methods course targeted elementary students from two lower SES semi-urban locations. To measure the impact on the elementary students, pre-service teachers administered embedded performance assessments to measure changes in student&rsquo;s understanding of the targeted science concept. The program&rsquo;s intent was to better understand how participation in the different methods course impacted their views of science teaching and what the pre-service teachers transferred to in-school science.</p>\n<p>SCI-TALKS provided 247 local at-risk youth with innovative, engaging and meaningful after-school science programming led by 82 elementary pre-service teachers who oftentimes were afraid of teaching science. Local classroom teachers acted as mentor teachers and provided assistance when needed at these sites that included elementary schools and local community centers. In addition to these SCI-TALKS pre-service teachers, the PI led a comparison group of pre-service teachers in regular elementary methods course where they participated in a more traditional clinical experience with observations of a classroom teacher teaching 15 science lessons. These pre-service teachers served as a quasi-experimental comparison group. Over the 3 year program, 82 SCI-TALKS pre-service teachers participated and 68 comparison pre-service teachers agreed to participate in the long-term comparative research study. To facilitate longitudinal follow-up research, the grant was extended through year 5 which allowed researchers to observe and interview graduated students in both groups who were now teaching in their own elementary classrooms.</p>\n<p>Results. SCI-TALKS has shown promising results. Several published findings (2 peer-review publications and 2 accepted but awaiting formal publication) resulted from this work. During student teaching, pre-service teachers&mdash;who had taught science in an afterschool program&mdash;created safe learning environments and frequently incorporated students&rsquo; ideas through formative assessment. Researchers showed that the long-term benefits of participating in an after-school field experience included more positive ideas about science, additional motivation to confront perceived barriers to teaching science during their student teaching semester, and increased confidence in teaching and teaching science. Details for implementation of the program were disseminated to both the early education community and the broader science-teacher educator community which would enable other institutions to consider replicating this program.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit: Local minority and at?risk youth had the opportunity to benefit from an after?school science program through a partnership with multiple institutions including the historically black West Virginia State University, county school districts, community centers, and parents. Students were immersed in a rich learning environment where they experienced place?based science. By incorporating an after-school science teaching practicum with an elementary science methods course, researchers had the opportunity to examine the long?term impact on pre?service science teaching practices by following these teachers through their student and first?year teaching experiences. This unique partnership interwove multiple levels of science learners which led to the development of a new model of science teaching and learning including after?school science programs and elementary baccalaureate programs.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts: Students, who have academic aptitude but lack socio?economic opportunities, were provided an accessible after?school education program embedded within the community and designed to spark scientific habits of mind. The project promoted teaching and learning by a community of educators&mdash;pre?service and mentor. Through multiple modes of dissemination, SCI?TALKS engaged multiple stakeholders to facilitate a sense of community and widely disseminate outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t
