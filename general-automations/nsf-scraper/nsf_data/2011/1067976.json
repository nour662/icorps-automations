 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors Howard Georgi and Cumrun Vafa at Harvard University. \r\n\r\nThis research addresses the fundamental laws of nature at short distances, from the distance scales currently being probed by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) down to the much shorter distances at which the interactions unify and (perhaps) the structure of spacetime itself is formed.  Thus, this research will deepen our formal understanding of the fascinating mathematical structure of string theory, which is a candidate for a fundamental theory of nature;  it will continue the search for probes of string theory at the LHC;  and it will develop new tools for the analysis of LHC observations to ensure that we can make the most effective use of this high-energy particle collider, one of the most important scientific projects in history. \r\n\r\nBecause the research funded by this award addresses some of the most fundamental questions in science, it will also have a number of broader impacts.  Research on these questions will continue to inspire talented young people to pursue the kind of rigorous technical education that they need for STEM fields.  More specifically, this research will affect Harvard graduate students and undergraduates in several ways.  Graduate students will participate in many of the projects directly.  In addition, there are \"in-house\" seminars in which postdocs and graduate students will be able to present their work in progress in an informal and supportive atmosphere, and younger students will be able to learn about the research of the group.  There will also practical mentoring of younger faculty.  Moreover, Professors Georgi and Vafa teach important undergraduate and graduate courses.  Likewise, Professor Georgi is also the Director of Undergraduate Studies for the Department of Physics and involved in efforts to improve undergraduate education and increase diversity in the STEM workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n In the past 5 years, the string theory research supported by this NSF grant has focused on elucidating the structure of possible new interactions and forces that can arise in the context of string theory.  These particles and forces have their origin from (two of the) extra dimensions of string theory and involve novel objects such as tensionless strings.  Major progress has been made including an atomic classification of all such possible forces and interactions. This atomic classification involved, somewhat like one is familiar in the context of chemistry, finding building blocks of matter and the rules of how they can be combined together.\n\n The particle physics research supported by this NSF grant has focused on the physics at the energy scale that is now being probed by the highest-energy collisions at the largest microscope ever built, the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, and its two magnificent lenses, the CMS and ATLAS detectors that allow experimental physicists from all other the world to make sense of the complicated images that emerge from these collisions.  Theorists help to get the most information out of this project, the most complicated basic science undertaking of all time, both by developing new tools to organize and analyze the data and by suggesting novel strategies to make sure that no corner is missed.  In this grant, we have worked on both, exploring new ways of picturing and analyzing high energy collisions and exploring models of what the picture might look like.\n\n   In addition to its most important goal of increasing our understanding the world, an experimental project of this magnitude and reach pushes the boundaries of technology in many directions and will produce countless spin-off technologies.  There are also spin-offs from basic research in theoretical physics of the kind supported by this grant.  Time and time again we have seen that theoretical work on the most basic problems in physics has led to totally unexpected advances in basic and applied mathematics and computing.  The mathematics of the work supported here, for example, may have applications to signal processing.  This is the kind of payoff that can arise when talented people, inspired by the most interesting questions in science, invent new tools to solve them.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cumrun Vafa"
