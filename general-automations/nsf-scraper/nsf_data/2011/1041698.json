 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's goal is to develop innovative statistical approaches to\r\nmulti-study genomic data analysis. Specific targets include\r\ngeneralization of meta-analysis tools used in medicine and social\r\nsciences to the genomics context, metrics for evaluating reproducibility\r\nof expression measurements across platform in the absence of a gold\r\nstandard, approaches for deriving and validating common expression\r\nscales across platforms, and a novel reformulation of the combination\r\nproblem based on constructing ``coexpression matrices'' in which an\r\nelement represents the coexpression of a subset of genes in a given\r\nstudy. The project includes software implementation, application to a\r\nset of representative genomic analyses, and development of public-domain\r\nsupport website.\r\n\r\nGenomics studies are studies that measure simultaneously the activity of\r\na large portion of the thousands of genes in a biological system. These\r\nhave given a great impulse to the life sciences in the past decade, and\r\nchanged the way in which biology, medicine, and biotechnology make\r\nprogress. A large number and variety of genomics studies are accruing.\r\nBecause of cost and difficulty in the acquisition of biological samples,\r\nespecially in medicine, the majority of genomic investigations are\r\ncarried out using a limited number of samples, and focus on highly\r\nspecific problems.  This scenario poses two important questions for the\r\ngenomics community. First, given the wide variety of genomic\r\ntechnologies and protocols, there is concern about reproducibility of\r\ngenomic findings across technologies and laboratories. How can one\r\nsystematically use the large body of genomic information available to\r\nassess reproducibility?  Second, given the large, but fragmented and\r\nheterogeneous, set of studies that are accruing, there is concern about\r\nthe ability of the scientific community to efficiently integrate the\r\nresulting knowledge.  How can one perform analysis of genomics data\r\nacross studies, across technologies and across related biological\r\nsystems? This project's overall goal is to address these two questions\r\nby developing data analysis tools for comparison and integration of\r\ngenomic information across studies, across measurement technologies and\r\nacross biological systems. Today, multi-study genomic analysis are rare,\r\ndespite the wide availability of genomic data in the public domain. The\r\npremise underlying this proposal is that this is due in large part to\r\nthe lack of specific, systematic and rigorous statistical approaches and\r\nthe associated software tools. This project aims at providing such tools\r\nand therefore, if the investigator's premise is correct, will promote a\r\nmore extensive, more efficient and more rigorous use of the vast\r\nresources made available by the massive investment made on genomic\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
