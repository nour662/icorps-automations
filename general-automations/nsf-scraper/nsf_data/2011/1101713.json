 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tropical cyclones are responsible for extensive damage and loss of life in coastal and island communities around the globe. They have been studied for decades, but are not fully understood.  Greater physical understanding of tropical cyclones will improve our ability to predict the behavior of individual storms and the effects of climate change on storm statistics. This project seeks further insight into the causes and consequences of tropical cyclone asymmetries, which are commonly associated with spiral rainbands, tilts and eyewall mesovortices. The following issues will be addressed:  the extent to which environmental conditions control the dominant asymmetries, the mechanisms that create or suppress asymmetries, and the impact of asymmetries on vortex intensity.\r\n\r\nThis project will involve complimentary studies with reduced (3-layer) and cloud-system resolving (CSR) tropical cyclone models. The reduced model will facilitate an efficient computational survey of prevailing asymmetries under different environmental conditions.  Moreover, it will be used to advance underdeveloped theories of core instabilities (which create asymmetries) and vortex resilience (resistance to tilt). The theoretical studies will focus on the roles of overturning circulation, boundary layer coupling, and diabatic forcing associated with moist convection. The effects of varying the surface-exchange coefficients, sea-surface temperature, mid-level relative humidity and cumulus parameterization scheme will be examined. Conclusions derived from the reduced model will be tested against CSR simulations, and any differences will be explained. The impact of transient and persistent asymmetries on vortex intensity will be assessed, partly by comparison of axisymmetric and 3D versions of the tropical cyclone models.\r\n\r\nFunds for this project will be used in part for the advanced training and mentorship of a postdoctoral researcher. Project findings will be disseminated through university seminars, journal publications, conference presentations, and a research web page.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTropical cyclones are commonly asymmetric owing to features such as spiral rainbands, eyewall mesovortices and vertical misalignments.  The findings of this research project have improved current understanding of how tropical cyclone asymmetries develop and influence the overall strength of the storm.  The method of investigation involved conducting numerical experiments with state-of-the-art weather research models run on high performance supercomputers.  Novel analysis techniques were developed to help interpret data generated by the experiments.\n\nOne study examined the statistical relationship between the maximum wind speed of a mature tropical cyclone and a select measure of the azimuthal asymmetry of convection in the vortex core.  Results from a large number of numerical experiments supported the existence of a robust negative correlation between the two quantities under a variety of environmental conditions.  Moreover, the results suggested that greater convective asymmetry coincides with a reduction of the relative contribution to vortex intensity that is attributable to unbalanced flow.\n\nA second study set forth to challenge a recent theory on what controls the vertical misalignment of a tropical cyclone that is exposed to ambient vertical wind shear.  Such misalignment (tilt) of the vortex is associated with the weakening of cyclonic winds.  One factor that affects the growth of tilt is moisture in the vortex core.  The theory under question maintains that moisture tends to inhibit tilt primarily as an indirect consequence of reducing the effective static stability of the atmosphere.  The potential importance of the mean secondary circulation associated with moist convection is neglected.  A direct and detailed comparison of theoretical predictions to numerical experiments showed that the theory has some merit but is not entirely correct.  It has been verified that cloud coverage (static stability reduction) alone effectively limits tilt, but the mean secondary circulation may contribute significantly to the same end.\n\nA third study examined the influence of moist convection on the mechanics and consequences of asymmetric instabilities of the inner core of an intense hurricane.  The problem was considered separately from that of the prior role of moist convection in shaping the vortex that becomes unstable. Contrary to some recent theories on the subject, moist convection was found to have only a minor impact on the initial wave growth that leads to the development of eyewall mesovortices. In other words, the wave growth and its energetics resembled that found in a dry nonconvective vortex with the same initial azimuthal velocity field.
