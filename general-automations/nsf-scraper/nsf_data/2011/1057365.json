The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe meeting includes invited lectures on topics of current research interest and also encourages poster presentations by students and recent Ph.D. recipients.  The conference brings together workers in a variety of different areas of research in harmonic analysis, with emphasis on facilitating the process of making pure mathematics applicable.\r\n\r\nConference web site: http://norbertwiener.umd.edu/FFT/",
