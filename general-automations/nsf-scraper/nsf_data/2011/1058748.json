 "awd_abstract_narration": "Logic solvers are software programs that can solve complex logical\r\nformulas fully automatically.  Problems in many areas of Computer\r\nScience, such as artificial intelligence, program analysis, security,\r\nhardware verification, and cyber-physical systems can be\r\ntranslated into logical formulas.  Those formulas can then be solved\r\nfully automatically by logic solvers. Over the past two decades, at\r\nleast ten different logic-solving communities have emerged, based on\r\ndifferent logical languages and solving techniques.  These communities\r\nhave independently been building computing infrastructure to aid\r\ndevelopment and evaluation of their solvers: libraries of benchmark\r\nformulas, cluster-backed web services, annual competitions, and more.\r\nSuch infrastructure also provides an important access point for\r\nusers, who can find all the solvers at one site, or even run solvers\r\non the infrastructure cluster to test their relative capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to build a single piece of shared\r\ncomputing infrastructure called StarExec, which will be used by \r\ndifferent logic solving communities.  StarExec will provide improved\r\nservices for established logic-solving communities, and lower the\r\nentry barrier for new and emerging communities.\r\n\r\nThe StarExec infrastructure will consist of a custom web service\r\ninterfacing to a medium-sized compute cluster.  This open-source\r\nservice will allow multiple logic-solving communities to host\r\nbenchmark libraries, run jobs comparing different solvers, and host\r\ncompetitions.  StarExec will leverage economies of scale to provide\r\nmore sophisticated services than is feasible for most individual\r\nlogic-solving communities.  A very important goal of StarExec is not\r\njust to collocate different logic-solving communities, but to unite\r\nthem.  To this end, the StarExec team will develop formal\r\nspecifications of both the syntax and proof-theoretic semantics of\r\ndifferent communities' logical languages.  This will be done using a\r\nmeta-language called LFSC (\"Logical Framework with Side Conditions\"),\r\ndeveloped in previous NSF-funded research.  Translation of formulas\r\nbetween compatible fragments of different logics will be implemented,\r\nwhich will will enable a greater degree of integration between solver\r\ncommunities than was previously possible.  For example, it will be\r\npossible for solvers in one community to be run on benchmarks from\r\nanother.  This integration will also aid users of logic solvers, who\r\nwill have a greater variety of options, all in a common framework, for\r\nsolving their problems.  The broader impact of the StarExec project\r\nwill be to accelerate the development, adoption, and convergence of\r\ndifferent logic-solving technologies.  This will enable faster\r\nprogress in nationally important application areas such as artificial\r\nintelligence, verification, security, and cyber-physical systems,\r\nwhich increasingly depend on high-performance logic solvers.",
