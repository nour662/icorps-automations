 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most common patterns of phenotypic plasticity in biology is the Temperature-Size Rule:  many insects, reptiles, amphibians and other organisms raised at higher environmental temperatures are smaller as adults.  Is this pattern an adaptation?is smaller better at higher temperatures?or an inevitable consequence  of the effects of temperature on physiology and development?  Recent studies with two agricultural pests, Tobacco Hornworms and Imported Cabbageworms, show that both larval (caterpillar) nutrition and rapid evolution can reverse the Temperature-Size Rule, leading to larger adults at higher rearing temperatures.  These exceptions to the rule provide a unique opportunity to understand the developmental mechanisms and selective causes of this widespread pattern of phenotypic plasticity.  The proposed studies integrate laboratory and field experiments with mathematical models to explore how larval nutrition, oxygen limitation, hormonal regulation, and natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) interact to generate the Temperature-Size Rule and its exceptions.   These studies will provide a new mechanistic and evolutionary understanding of how plant quality, climate and seasonal weather interact to determine body size and ecological success in Tobacco Hornworms and Imported Cabbageworms, two important agricultural pests in the US.  Research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at UNC and Duke, and outreach via Public Television, the North Carolina Museum of Life and Science, and the San Francisco Exploratorium, are integral components of the project.  In addition, a citizen science program for Imported Cabbageworms (i.e., Cabbage White Butterflies) will be developed that involves community gardeners and organic farmers in North Carolina and other states.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBody size is one of the most important traits of any organism, influencing nearly all aspects of its biology and fitness. In most organisms except birds and mammals, warmer temperatures during development result in larger adult body size, an empirical pattern called the Temperature-Size Rule (TSR).  The TSR is a type of phenotypic plasticity, where the thermal reaction norm-- the relationship between developmental temperature and adult size&mdash;has a negative slope. The TSR has been reported in nearly 80% of species for organisms ranging from microbes and plants to insects and lizards, but the causes of the TSR remain poorly understood. Our project used laboratory and field studies with two herbivorous insect species, the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) and the imported cabbageworm (Pieris rapae), to evaluate the developmental, physiological and evolutionary determinants of variation in the TSR.  There were three major findings from our research.\n\nFirst, nutrition and host-plant quality can alter the TSR and the slope of the reaction norm between temperature and adult size.  For example in M. sexta, the TSR holds (negative slope) for larvae feeding on typical hostplants (e.g. Tobacco) and high-quality artificial diets, but the TSR is reversed (positive slope) for larvae on invasive, lower-quality hostplants (e.g. Devils Claw).  Similarly in P. rapae, the slope of the reaction norm varies with larval nutrition, when fed on balanced, carbohydrate-rich, or protein-rich artificial diets, or when fed on fertilized or unfertilized hostplants.  More generally in P. rapae, developmental temperature and larval nutrition interacted to affect a variety of traits, including survival, growth rate, development time, and adult size, with better performance on balanced diets.  These studies demonstrate that the TSR must be considered in the context of other environmental factors including nutrition.\n\nSecond, there is substantial variation in the TSR among populations within a species.  For example our studies show variation from negative to positive reaction norm slopes for P. rapae populations from different latitude in North America and in Japan, with different latitudinal patterns on the two continents.  Experiments with North American populations show that northern populations (e.g. Nova Scotia) are less sensitive to variation in nutritional quality than southern populations (e.g. North Carolina).  Because P. rapae is native to Europe and independently invaded North America and Japan during the past few centuries, we know that these population differences have evolved relatively recently.  These studies demonstrate that plastic responses to temperature and nutrition can evolve independently in different populations in response to local environmental conditions.\n\nThird, we used field experiments to test the hypothesis that selection on adult body size within a population varies with seasonal temperature:  specifically that larger body size is selectively favored in cooler spring conditions, but that smaller body size is favored in hotter summer conditions.  Contrary to predictions, our field experiments with M. sexta and P. rapae showed consistent selection favoring larger adult size and faster larval development time in both cooler and hotter seasons.  Surprisingly, adult size and development time were not significantly correlated: selection on size and development time operated independently.  These results suggest selection and evolution of adult size are not strongly constrained by tradeoffs with other traits in these insect species.\n\nCollectively, our research indicates that thermal reaction norms, including the temperature-size rule, in insects are strongly influenced by larval nutrition, and can evolve in response to local environmental conditions along latitudinal gradients over time scales of decades to centuries.  Because the two insect species we studied are agricultural pests in North America, our studies also suggest that body size and other important traits have the potential to evolve in widespread and abundant insect pests, in response to climate changes in temperature and other environmental factors.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joel G Kingsolver"
