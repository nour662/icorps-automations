 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interference is a key impediment to achieving high data rates in wireless communications systems.  Intentional interference or \"jamming\" has primarily been studied in military communication networks.  Most prior work has used non-descriptive models for the jammers, without ascribing any strategies or special capabilities to them beyond their ability to broadcast noise.  This research project focuses on the design of the jamming strategies themselves, rather than on their mitigation (although the latter issue is inherently addressed as well).  Questions considered include: What information can jammers exploit?  How does the jammer deal with situations where this information is imprecise?  How can distributed jammers coordinate their interference to maximize its effect?  How should the jamming be designed to mask communications that must be kept secure from eavesdroppers?\r\n\r\nThe project is focuses on jamming techniques that exploit multiple antennas at the physical layer.  Specific research thrusts include:\r\n-- Cooperative jamming in wireless networks: Cooperative policies are being developed that optimally allocate resources to the desired link and friendly jammers.\r\n-- Malicious feedback: Scenarios where the \"jamming\" is not noise but rather malicious physical layer feedback. These are studied to determine the extent of potential damage and possible remedies.\r\n-- Robustness to inaccurate channel estimates: Maximizing the impact of jamming depends critically on the quality of the available channel information.  This research is investigating the effect of inaccuries in this information and on techniques that are robust to such.\r\n-- Experimental studies: Using MIMO radios in their lab, the researchers are implementing cooperative jamming approaches in a real network and studying the gap between theoretical and actual performance.",

Most of the work has been focused on exploiting cooperation with other users to improve secrecy.  With just a single transmitter and receiver, there are limited options available in attempting to exploit the physical layer for improved security.  However, if another cooperative user is involved, the number of available options quickly multiplies.  The additional user or \"helper\" can provide a number of important functions; for example, it can help relay the message from the transmitter to the receiver, allowing the individual messages to be of much lower power (and hence to be less detectable) than if the transmitter attempted to communicate directly with the receiver.  On the other hand, the helper could transmit a noise signal that would mask the signal of interest in such a way that it disturbed the ability of the eavesdropper to decode the message, but not that of the desired user.  Such a goal can be accomplished by exploiting information about the specific properties of the wireless chan..."
