 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Daniel M. Downey at James Madison University.  The research projects supported in this site are in a wide range of areas of chemistry. Undergraduates will be recruited to this site from regional colleges and universities as well as James Madison University.  The site will include participation from two outside mentors from other higher education institutions, as well as high school teachers and high school students.  The site is unique in that it integrates deaf/hard of hearing researchers at every level (students and instructors).  In addition, research students have the opportunity to teach chemistry to a large group of deaf/hard of hearing middle school youngsters taking part in a summer camp on the JMU campus.  The site will support eight undergraduate research students per summer in a ten week program, in addition to supporting a number of visiting faculty and high-school teachers.  A sample of the projects that researchers will work on include:  (1)  the synthesis and study of the supramolecular aggregation of novel amphiphiles; (2)  the study of the solid state decomposition kinetics using metal-oxide nanoparticle catalysts; (3)  the analysis of fish otoliths for trace amounts of toxic heavy metals as well as a study looking for endocrine disrupting compounds in natural waters; (4)  the development of sensitive and accurate greenhouse gas sensors; (5) spectroscopic studies of nucleotide binding proteins and (6) the study of interfacial electron transfer in biomolecular systems.   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including training in scientific communication.\r\n\r\nYoung scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide students without significant research experience a chance to conduct cutting-edge research in the chemical sciences with dedicated faculty mentors at this predominantly undergraduate institution.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for further study in the chemical sciences, and graduate school, with eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.  A unique feature of this REU site is the intensive integration of deaf students and faculty with the hearing majority.  Students participating in this site will learn to communicate science effectively to both groups, and deaf/hard of hearing students will be encouraged to enter or continue study in STEM areas.",

Appalachian region was continued for three years (summers) at James Madison University (JMU).  The primary mission of this site was to engage undergraduate students in active research projects so that new knowledge would be gained, the students would improve academically and students would be encouraged to eventually pursue science careers. A secondary, but important, goal of the site was to provide access in chemistry for deaf/hard-of hearing students and to address the needs of this historically underrepresented group.  The site included 44 students (34% deaf or hard of hearing) who worked for 10 week periods during summer months in small groups each under the close supervision of faculty mentors in the areas of analytical, environmental, biochemistry, synthesis, natural products, materials science and spectroscopy.  Each summer 10 ten students were selected by competitive application process with five coming from JMU and five from other schools.  In addition, two student sign interpreters were engaged to both facilitate communication and do their own research in novel finger spelled words containing unfamiliar grapheme combinations and phonetic clusters and to aid with communication between hearing and deaf participants.  A non-chemist faculty mentor from the discipline of communication and speech disorders was employed to mentor the sign interpreter students and assist the professional sign language interpreters.  Two staff members for instrument maintenance, deaf high school students, secondary school teachers, JMU faculty and some deaf faculty mentors completed the teams that numbered about 23-25 each summer.  With others funded by separate grants the total number of people in the program was about 45-50 each summer.  Daily sessions were also held each summer of outreach to younger students K-10) for a science camp held at the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind (VSDB). Both deaf and hearing REU participants served as mentors in this camp that included both on site activities and a one day visit to the chemistry facilities at JMU.  The goal to create critical mass of a group of trained interpreters within the dynamics of a research laboratory environment was met. The inclusion of both hearing and deaf/hard of hearing students resulted in better understanding of each group\u00c6s needs relative to the other particularly in the attitudes and interactions of hearing participants toward those with disabilities; and contributed to removing barriers in science education for the latter.  The inclusion of student and faculty teams from smaller four-year schools in the region extended research opportunities to those with limited resources in their home institutions.  Training in signing scientific terminology for the student sign interpreters addressed a need not taught in most sign instruction programs that has been a barrier for encouragement of deaf students of all ages in choosing careers in science.  The products for the advancement of knowledge in science include 141 outside presentations and publications to date.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/07/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel M Downey"
