 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create InvertNet, an on-line virtual museum comprising >50 million insect and related arthropod specimens housed at 22 Midwestern institutions, focusing on the research theme of effects of land use changes on the biota of the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi River drainage basins.  These collections document 160 years of environmental change and are an invaluable and irreplaceable resource but, at present, are largely inaccessible to scientists and the general public.  Most previous efforts to capture and disseminate invertebrate collection data have focused on label data alone.  InvertNet will use advanced digitization and networking technologies to capture and display 2D and 3D images of specimens and labels, and incorporate them into a searchable database. These new techniques should reduce the cost of digitizing insect specimens substantially.\r\n\r\nBy allowing users to find and view detailed images of specimens of particular species and their associated data labels, InvertNet will provide universal access to collections previously restricted to researchers.  It will include links to the popular BugGuide.net insect identification website and to other biodiversity data portals used by researchers, educators, and the general public.  This will facilitate and support many aspects of biological research and education, including species discovery and identification, pest management, ecology and biogeography.  InvertNet will serve as a model, applicable to other kinds of biological collections, for the use of efficient, computer-assisted procedures to increase the speed and accuracy of collection data capture. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project is part of a larger project (InvertNet) aimed at efficiently capturing data for a large numbers of invertebrates in natural history collections in the Midwest.  Assembling this enormous amount of specimen data will allow studies on  changes in distribution of species relative to habitat changes, and will  be a valuable resource in landscape management and ecosystem  protection.\n\nThe Ohio State University contribution involved the mite and crayfish collections.  The aim was imaging of all label data, which would then be transcribed to a database using new technology being developed at the Illinois Natural History Survey. \n\nAs part of the project we imaged labels for 4,803 lots of crayfish, and 36,700 mite slides.  For the crayfish we also imaged the crayfish themselves, allowing display of not only the label and the processed label data, but also the actual specimens.  For mites this is not possible, the specimens are too small for the imaging set-up, but images do show actual label information and, to some degree, the condition of the specimens (is the slide well ringed, is there air intrusion, etc.). \n\nThere have been some delays at Invertnet in transcribing data, so we also started working on actual data capture by modifying and updating an existing spreadsheet of crayfish data.  One item needed to maximize the functionality of existing Ohio State collection databases is georeferencing, which allows records to be displayed instantly on maps, greatly improving the utility of the data.  Unfortunately, this particular item is very time consuming, but even so 7,418 records in the spreadsheet (out of 8,855) have been georeferenced, and will be uploaded to the OSU and InvertNet servers once final data checking is completed.  Data for the mites, as of yet without the images, is already available on-line at http://acarology.osu.edu/database.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/17/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Johannes S Klompen"
