 "awd_abstract_narration": "Participating Institutions: Rowan University, Kansas State University \r\n\r\nProject Description\r\nThis project is offering a model for a general-education course that supports a view of knowledge as a continuum among all disciplines and will emphasize the synergies that exist between music and engineering.  The course, \"Music, Signals & Systems\", will address the merged topics of music composition and electronic signal analysis and generation. The project involves collaboration among the Electrical and Computer Engineering Departments and the Music Departments of both Rowan University and Kansas State University. Through exploring creative music composition from an engineering systems point of view, students are being exposed to concepts that are fundamental to both music and engineering, emphasizing the synergy of the disciplines and fostering the students' creativity. The course, which doesn't have mathematics or music prerequisites, is serving as an example to counter the notion of \"general education\" as something that is outside of learning that is associated with specific degree program curricula. Topics are being treated from a holistic perspective involving combined systems-engineering and music-composition projects.\r\n\r\nBroader Significance\r\nThe project promotes a view of knowledge as a continuum among all disciplines and will emphasize the synergies that exist between music and engineering. It hopes to provide students with an educational experience that will stimulate lifelong learning, offering a model for how the university can provide a learning platform that is appropriate for the needs of both student & faculty. It utilizes a commercial line of modular instruments to create a student-laptop based laboratory that can be moved to wherever the music may evolve.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSignals, Systems and Music \n\nKansas State University &amp; Rowan University\nEngineering and music faculty at Rowan University and Kansas State University conceptualized and developed courses at their schools that present a model for education that is inclusive and collaborative, drawing students from  engineering, music and other majors across each campus.   Signals, Systems and Music was conceived as a response to the notion of general education courses as isolated experiences in a discipline \"other than\" a student\u00c6s major.  As disciplines dissolve and academic departments become more multi-disciplinary, academe has acknowledged that models for understanding the world&mdash;social and physical&mdash;can no longer be isolated.  The Kansas State and Rowan faculty use the perspectives of the musician and the engineer which, taken together, represent an opportunity to approach learning from the standpoint of interdependent knowledge.  Each University developed their own version of the course over the 3 year period of NSF Grant DUE-1044734.  Both schools will continue to teach the course in versions that are appropriate to the environment and for the student demographic.  Descriptions of these courses can be found at http://www.signals-systems-and-music.org/ for Kansas State University and at http://users.rowan.edu/~mease/courses/ssms14/content.html for Rowan University.
