 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to formulate and solve a tractable closed-loop supply chain network design problem that includes: (a) facility configuration that is robust to variations in the cost and constraint implications of possible carbon emission regulations; (b) transportation capacities of various modes that accommodate random variations in demands and returns; and (c) a product return policy that balances the tradeoffs in revenues, transportation costs, and emission-related costs. The problem's difficulty arises from the discrete character of facility investment and return policy choices, the nonlinearity introduced by seeking a robust design, and the large number of scenarios required to accurately represent stochastic demand and return quantities. By restricting how the transportation capacities depend on the uncertain carbon policy parameters, an affinely adjustable robust counterpart is obtained for the design problem with stochastic subproblems. The research tasks are to approximate the discrete solution to this robust counterpart and to efficiently reduce the number of stochastic scenarios to be considered.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will help manufacturing firms to maintain global competitiveness by proactively designing their closed loop supply chains in anticipation of possible market mechanisms to control carbon emissions while mitigating the uncertainties associated with transportation demands. The innovative combination of robust and stochastic optimization will be widely applicable to capacity investment problems under uncertainties that differ fundamentally in character, depending on the existence of historical precedent and the repeatability of conditions. Results and insights derived from this work will enhance the training of graduate students in network and stochastic optimization as well as undergraduate students in engineering economic analysis. A related complex, ill-structured problem-solving experience will be developed for engineering economy courses and, to ease its adoption in large-enrollment settings, will be disseminated via open-source software tools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project applied mathematical methods for optimization under uncertainty to the design of a closed-loop supply chain, which both delivers products to customers and collects products for re-use, remanufacturing or recycling.  Long-term decisions to build or configure facilities and medium-term decisions to procure capacity for transporting products by various modes must account for distinct types of uncertainty.  Probability distributions can be estimated for some of the uncertain parameters, such as demands for products similar to existing or previous ones.  But other quantities, such as a possible tax on greenhouse gas emissions, lack any basis for estimation.  Distinct optimization modeling approaches with corresponding solution methods exist for these two types of uncertainty.  The decision model formulations developed in this project combined those approaches and methods to gain insight into how uncertainty affects the closed-loop supply chain design choices. \n\nWhen possible carbon emission regulations on transportation were included in the design decision model, the optimal design included additional facilities to reduce the distance traveled along with higher usage of transportation modes with lower emission rates.  However, if the allocation of transportation capacity among modes could be adjusted in response to the carbon tax rates, some of this increased facility investment was avoided.  Uncertainty in the product demand and return quantities led to lower numbers of facilities built, which indicated the potential for over-investment in facilities of this source of uncertainty is ignored.  When inventory costs and distinct lead-times for manufacturing and remanufacturing were incorporated in the model, the results indicated benefits from locating storage facilities close to the factory.   \n\nIncorporating uncertainty within the optimization model increases the computational burden of finding solutions.  This computational load, in terms of time and/or memory requirements, grows as the number of decision-making stages increases, where decisions in later stages can respond to information received between stages.  The project included exploration of enhancements to a divide-and-conquer method that lowered the computation time.  The outcomes also included a discovery that characterized the nature of constraints that must exist in the problem formulation in order for the adjustability of later-stage decisions to make a difference in the minimum cost of the design solution. Understanding these conditions helps a decision-maker determine whether it is worth the additional effort to formulate a decision model that accounts for this type of flexibility.\n\nA new advanced graduate course in stochastic optimization was developed, taught three times, and established permanently at Iowa State University.
