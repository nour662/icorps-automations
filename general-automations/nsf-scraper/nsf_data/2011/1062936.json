 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three year REU Site program will enhance the educational experience of undergraduate engineering students by actively engaging them in advanced research activities within FAMU-FSU College of Engineering (CoE). The newly constructed  Aeropropulsion, Mechatronics and Energy (AME) Research Building will provide an excellent setting for the program. First, the REU Site program will be a collective effort with the participation of a diverse group of engineering faculty. A wide range of advanced topics are proposed including the development of micro air vehicles, multi-modal robots, active flow control, sensors and actuators, smart materials, energy harvesting and storage, etc.. The multidisciplinary nature of these projects will engage students in cross-cutting technologies by inspiring the integration and synthesis of ideas and facilitating a better understanding of engineering design at the system level. During the summer, the student researchers will also participate in several innovative programs aimed at enriching their experience, including a Learning Through Teaching program and an engineering design competition to promote teamwork and collaborative design activities. \r\n\r\nThe CoE is the only Ph.D. granting engineering college in the nation that combines the strengths of an HBCU (Historically Black College and University) in Florida A & M University and a major research university in FSU. The Mechanical Engineering Department has a number of faculty with established track records in both scholarly activities and recruitment and education of minority and female engineering students. Thus, the REU site program will have broader impacts by increasing the number of US engineering students, in particular underrepresented minorities and women, who will pursue advanced degrees. Results will be disseminated at educational conferences, in journal articles, and by conducting workshops and distributing newsletters.  This information will also be made available through a dedicated website.\r\n\r\n\"This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\"",
