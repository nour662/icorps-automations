 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a digital audio archive that will enable\r\nscientists in several fields to approach novel research issues in speech and language\r\nstudies, issues in group decision-making, and issues at the leading edge of\r\nhuman communication scholarship.  The Supreme Court of the United States\r\n(SCOTUS) has been recording its public proceedings since 3 October 1955.\r\nThese recordings - now in the National Archives - span nearly five decades\r\nand consist principally of oral arguments in which justices and attorneys\r\nengage in various forms of persuasion and communication between bench and\r\nbar and, obliquely, among the justices themselves. The arguments have been\r\ntranscribed professionally across the entire period, creating a matchless\r\ncollection of audio materials coupled with highly accurate transcripts. The\r\naudio - along with other activities captured on audio such as the\r\nannouncement of opinions - offers a unique opportunity for researchers\r\nacross a wide spectrum of disciplines to engage in novel and transforming\r\nresearch projects that were once thought beyond the reach of investigators.\r\n\r\nThe chief result of this work will be a complete and continuing archive of\r\nmore than six thousand hours of SCOTUS audio.  It will provide synchronized\r\n(i.e., time-coded) transcripts of the collection, identify and tag\r\nindividual speakers, build new mark-up tools for these new domains, and\r\nshare the corpus with researchers and faculty. The result of this\r\ninteraction among political scientists, legal scholars, linguists, and\r\ncomputer scientists will yield: new knowledge in the modeling of\r\nmulti-party discussions with complex goals, novel strategies in small group decision\r\nprocess analysis, and path-breaking approaches to extended collaborative\r\ncommentary addressing the dynamics of human communication.\r\n\r\nThe SCOTUS archive will be maintained as a shared public resource to\r\nenhance study and understanding of the Supreme Court of the United States. It will\r\nbe available to anyone with World Wide Web access. Based on past\r\nexperience, principal audiences include: researchers across diverse domains, teachers\r\nand students, lawyers and litigants, and the visually- and\r\nhearing-impaired.\r\n\r\nToday, more than a million unique users access selected SCOTUS materials\r\neach month. With a complete and updated SCOTUS archive and improved ability\r\nto query and search, the number of users should expand substantially.\r\n\r\nBy exploiting common interest and beneficial interactions among diverse\r\nresearch communities, this project will create a vast collection of digital\r\nobjects. Working with partners experienced in data-sharing, the effort aims\r\nat revolutionizing the ability to collaborate with physically distributed\r\nteams of researchers and their students.",
