 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mw=8.8 Maule earthquake off the coast of Chile on\r\nFebruary 27, 2010 is the 5th largest megathrust earthquake ever to be recorded and the 2nd\r\nlargest to be recorded by modern digital seismic networks. Immediately following the\r\nMaule earthquake, teams of seismologists from Germany, France, the UK, and the US,\r\nworking with seismologists in Chile, coordinated resources to deploy both broadband and\r\nshort period seismometers and accelerometers above the rupture zone to capture\r\naftershocks associated with this significant earthquake. Data recorded from these stations\r\nwill be combined to produce an open international community data volume providing an\r\nunprecedented opportunity to investigate processes associated with great earthquakes and\r\nto image the anatomy of a subduction zone. A defining characteristic of the Maule aftershock investigations\r\nhas been collaboration, at both national and international levels. The original involvement\r\nin the data collection by US teams grew voluntarily out of the IRIS community, and the\r\nrationale of greater efficiencies through cooperation was readily adapted by the five\r\ninternational groups working in the region.\r\n\r\nIn this project the researchers will carry out a broad but\r\ninterrelated spectrum of seismic analyses to the Maule international seismic data set,\r\nalong with a reanalysis of a selection of data collected in the rupture zone prior to the\r\nearthquake, to address some of the fundamental scientific objectives that motivated the\r\ninitial data collection. These objectives fall into two general categories: (1) rupture\r\nprocesses of megathrusts, and (2) active tectonics and dynamics of an oceanic-continental\r\n(Andean) margin. They intend to produce an internally consistent set of data products across a range of\r\nanalytical techniques. The PIs will share graduate students and scheduling extended visits to each others labs, thereby exposing students to a significantly broader range of experience than most students typically enjoy. Finally, they plan to engage our international colleagues by sharing some analysis tasks of mutual\r\ninterest. Data products generated by this study will be made available to the broader\r\ninternational community via a dedicated web site.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe principal goal of this project was to use the numerous (thousands) aftershocks of the magnitude 8.8 Maule, Chile, earthquake to illuminate the structure of the portion of the Nazca-South America subduction zone that this earthquake ruptured.  For context, the Maule earthquake was the fifth largest magnitude earthquake yet recorded, and because of an unusually fortuitous set of circumstances, its aftershock series was one of the best recorded post-seismic sequence to date.  We used recordings of the aftershocks collected during the six months after the main shock to characterize the seismic attenuation and anisotropy in south-central Chile.  Seismic attenuation relates directly to both seismic hazard - greater attenuation typically means less shaking - and to the thermal state of the Earth between the subduction interface juxtaposing the Nazca and South America plates and the Earth's surface.  Seismic anisotropy relates to the directions of upper mantle flow - and thus to geodynamics of subduction - and, at shallower depths, to rock fabrics and mineral alignments in the Earth's crust.\n\nWe applied a method, developed by our group, to measure seismic attenuation of seismc shear (S) waves relative to seismic compression (P) waves.  We used a subset of ~150 larger magnitude aftershock - which were well recorded on the ~75 seismic stations deployed in the main shcok rupture region - to observe seismic attenuation.  We find that the attenuation is very systematic, with high attenuation in the hot wedge of mantle rocks above the subducted Nazca slab, and lower attenuation in the subducted Nazca slab.  We also find that a low attenuation structure extends upward into South American lithosphere from the Nazca slab in the central portion of the rupture region.  This structure may be a large subducted seamount or oceanic volcanic ridge; it was also imaged independently by a group in Liverpool, who used P wave tomography to resolve the structure (Hicks et al., 2014). \n\nWe also find a spatial correlation between high attenuation at shallow depths beneath coastal Chile and areas of greatest seismic slip during the main shock earthquake, as determined by an independent group of scientists (Lorito et al., 2010).  This correlation is intriguing because it hints at a relationship between the thermal structure of the Nazca-South America interplate interface and ease of seismi slip:  where slip was greatest, seismic attenuation was high, and that probably indicates that the are of greatest slip was also relatively warm.  We know from laboratory experiments that rocks near melting temperatures are easier to deform than cold rocks, and this association may explain our observation of correlation between maximum co-seismic slip and hig seismic attenuation.\n\nWe also used the aftershocks to understand upper mantle flow and crustal fabrics in the Maul earthquake rupture region.  We find that the pattern of uper mantle mineral alignment changes from being paproximately parallel to the Nazca plate's motion relative to South America, beneath coastal Chile seismic stations, to a direction that is more nearly NE-SE beneath stations deployed in the central valley region.  Beneath the Andes, the mineral fabric (and presumably upper mantle flow) is also more nearly NE-SW, on average.  The difference between the two sets of measurements probably reflects differences between minerals oriented by the shear between the subducting Nazca plate and overriding South America, which is the predominant process occurring beneath the coastal stations, and more complicated three-dimensional flow in the wedge of hot upper mantle lying between the base of the South American lithosphere and the top of the (much deeper) subducted Nazca slab beneath the central valley an the Andes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/12/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Raymond M Russo"
