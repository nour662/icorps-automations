There are also significant risk factors reform in the DC public schools takes place in a highly charged political environment where 17 different management structures have been tried since 1804. However, the notion of a consortium that provides accurate evidence and data is a vital one, as the District attempts to sustain the momentum of reform that was initiated by moving to Mayoral control.",
