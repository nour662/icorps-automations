 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless acoustic communication is the typical physical-layer technology underwater\r\nbecause of the high medium absorption of radio frequencies and of the scattering\r\nproblem affecting optical waves. As of today, however, acoustic communication\r\nsolutions support only delay-tolerant low-bandwidth monitoring applications.\r\nConversely, this research enables near-real-time acquisition and processing of\r\nheterogeneous data from mobile and static ocean exploration platforms. Reaching this\r\ngoal will improve the efficiency of monitoring key dynamic oceanographic phenomena\r\nsuch as phytoplankton growth and rate of photosynthesis, salinity and temperature\r\ngradient, and concentration of pollutants. Toward this end, this research studies\r\nunderwater inter-vehicle communication solutions aimed at enhancing the capabilities of\r\nthe NSF's Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) cyberinfrastructure.\r\nThe primary intellectual merit of this project offers the distinction between two forms of\r\nposition uncertainty. Typically, uncertainty in the position of a mobile vehicle as\r\nestimated in relation to itself (which the PI refers to as internal uncertainty) is the focus\r\nof distributed underwater robotics and networking. By contrast, the PI introduces the\r\nnew notion of external uncertainty, in which uncertainty in the position of a mobile\r\nvehicle is estimated by others. Specifically, this project focuses on modeling external\r\nuncertainty, on designing reliable underwater communication solutions that exploit the\r\nexternal-uncertainty notion, and on demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating\r\ncomputation and communication resources on marine science and technology through\r\nemulations and field experiments.\r\nOne of the broader impacts of this work is the generation of computer-literate\r\nundergraduate and graduate researchers with a comprehensive knowledge in\r\nunderwater sensing, communication, and coordination. The PI will create new teaching\r\nmodules on distributed sensing, provide opportunities for exchange programs, leverage\r\nexisting minority student outreach networks at Rutgers, and incorporate student\r\nexchange programs as well as team-teaching approaches.",
