However, chemical approaches do not rely on biotechnology and offer considerable versatility.  Specifically, thermochemical and catalytic processes can convert biomass-derived carbohydrates to a wide variety of derivatives across a number of markets, including fuels, polymers, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals.  \r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks funding for the support of a symposium to be held at the 241st American Chemical Society (ACS) National Meeting on March 27-31, 2011 in Anaheim, California. The title of the symposium is \"Direct Cellulose Conversion to Chemicals and Fuels,\" and the PI is the symposium organizer.  The editor of an established sustainable chemistry journal (Dr. Guido Kemeling from the journal ChemSusChem) has agreed to serve as the Session Chair.  The assembling together of experts in the area of chemical biomass conversion for a special symposium at the ACS meeting will enable cross-fertilization of ideas and technologies, foster collaboration, and generally raise awareness of this approach to bio-energy production, potentially leading to partnerships with industry.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe symposium will include presentations by young researchers (students and postdocs, including representation from under-represented groups), and also reaches out internationally, with invitations extended to speakers in China, England, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, and the Netherlands.  Representatives from academe, industry, and the national labs will participate.  Finally, in terms of curricular development, the PI?s own participation in the symposium will be of assistance in assembling new course materials for an Industrial Chemistry course, which includes a section on alternative energy.",
