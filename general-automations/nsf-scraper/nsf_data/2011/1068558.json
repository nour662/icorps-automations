 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Yong-Shi Wu at the University of Utah.\r\n\r\nFor the past two decades, string theory has been one of the most intensely investigated areas of theoretical high-energy physics.  This is true chiefly because string theory offers what is currently the most successful method of unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces (strong, weak, and electromagnetic).  Results from string theory have also spilled over into many other branches of physics, leading to improved understanding of gauge theories, condensed-matter physics, and heavy-ion physics.  String theory has also led to powerful new insights in mathematics.  In this project, Professor Wu aims to study algebraic and geometric structures in quantum field theory and string theory, which he envisions to provide a theoretical framework for accounting for all fundamental interactions in particle physics.  The PI plans to focus, specifically, on the possibility of new states of matter, with the idea that better understanding new states of matter should help us better understand the origin of our Cosmos and its past (particularly early) history.  This work will also have important connections to condensed-matter physics.\r\n\r\nThis project is also envisioned to have several broader impacts.  Graduate students and postdocs will be supported and trained to be future professionals. The PI will present seminars and thereby prompt scientific exchanges of ideas. Scholarly review articles and articles describing research to non-specialist audiences will be written to convey recent developments to colleagues in the physics community and to the general public.  The PI is also writing a new textbook, \"Physics and Geometry\", and developing new classroom instructional materials.",
