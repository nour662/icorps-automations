 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Dynamic abnormal grain growth (DAGG) is a recently-discovered secondary recrystallization phenomenon that occurs only during plastic deformation at elevated temperature. DAGG can rapidly produce very large single crystals in the solid state at relatively low homologous temperatures, approximately 0.65 Tm, a feat not possible by any other process. The dynamic nature of DAGG is its most unique characteristic and poses new challenges to current understandings of abnormal grain growth and grain-boundary migration, foundational topics in the metals science of microstructure evolution. To date, DAGG has been observed in only two materials, Mo and Ta BCC refractory metals. The proposed research will investigate the processes which give rise to DAGG in these metals and then develop new metal systems susceptible to DAGG. Research goals include developing (1) a capability to predict when and in what materials DAGG will occur and (2) a capability to control DAGG in materials susceptible to abnormal grain growth. The resulting mechanistic understanding of DAGG will be used to predict the occurrence of DAGG under conditions of technological importance.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Dynamic abnormal grain growth (DAGG) is a recently-discovered phenomenon in the field of materials science. DAGG occurs while deforming polycrystalline material at elevated temperature and has been used to grow large single crystals in molybdenum and tantalum for scientific studies. Beyond this initial practical application, DAGG represents an opportunity to gain new fundamental insights into the evolution of material microstructure. Controlling material microstructure is critical to the manufacture of advanced components in many industries, particularly the transportation industries. Potential impacts of this research include creating new materials and improving the quality of manufactured components. The proposed research will enhance collaborations with General Motors and Sandia National Laboratory. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the fields of materials and metals science through research activities and as well as mentoring during academic studies. Outreach activities which promote science and engineering to the local community will be supported.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMetals and their alloys used in technological applications today are typically composed of many small grains, each an individual crystal of the material.  The size, shape and other features of these grains determine the mechanical and physical behaviors of the material they compose.  In the manufacture of components from metallic materials, high temperatures and deformation are commonly used to produce desired component shapes and to control the nature of grains composing the material.  This project studied the fundamental mechanisms by which grains in metallic materials grow during deformation at elevated temperatures and examined how these changes in grain structure influence material properties.  The primary focus of this research was on the specific phenomenon called dynamic abnormal grain growth, DAGG.  Through DAGG, one or a few grains grow extremely rapidly during deformation at elevated temperature.  In the extreme case, DAGG has been used to rapidly produce large single crystals in the metals molybdenum and tantalum.  Beyond fundamental scientific interest, the DAGG phenomenon is of interest for two important practical reasons.  First, it provides a means of producing large single crystals that cannot be otherwise produced.  Second, it offers a means to understand how large grains might be prevented during high-temperature deformation of metals when such large grains are detrimental to component performance.\n\nThis project produced important new scientific understanding of the DAGG phenomenon.  It established that grain-boundary curvature is a primary driving force for the migration of boundaries during DAGG.  Data produced support the concept that plastic deformation at elevated temperatures increases grain-boundary mobility, an important contributor to the rapid grain growth observed.  The rate of grain-boundary migration for a DAGG grain was demonstrated to be more than two orders of magnitude faster during plastic deformation than without concurrent deformation.  While the crystallographic texture of a material does not necessarily control the rate of boundary migration and growth for an abnormal grain, it can influence the initiation of DAGG, which demonstrates a preference for growth of grains having a specific crystallographic orientation relative to the geometry of deformation.  Numerous experiments demonstrated the use of DAGG for growing large single crystals in different commercial-purity molybdenum materials.  These results constitute the most significant intellectual merit produced by this study.\n\nThis project trained several students and disseminated technical results to the community of researchers and industrial practitioners in the field.  Two students successfully completed doctoral dissertations and degrees under this project.  One student successfully completed a masters degree under this project.  One graduate student began her doctoral studies under this project, and continues those studies under a different project.  Two undergraduate students gained research experience under this project.  Numerous publications and presentations of research results at international conferences disseminated project findings to the community of researchers and industrial practitioners.  Collaboration with industry was used to directly disseminate knowledge to scientists and engineers who can make use of it.  Under this project, data were released through a public database hosted by ASM International.  These results constitute the most significant broader impacts produced by this study.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric M Taleff"
