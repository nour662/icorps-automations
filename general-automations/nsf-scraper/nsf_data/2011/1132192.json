 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial funding for an advanced study institute (ASI) on complex systems in physics to be held in Shanghai, China, in June 2012. A team of 12 senior researchers and 24 assistants from the U.S. will join colleagues at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) to offer a two-week hands-on course demonstrating table-top experiments in complex non-linear physical systems. About 70 participants, primarily junior faculty members, will be selected from underdeveloped regions of Central and Southeast Asia. The objective is to demonstrate that interesting and productive experiments can be conducted with relatively inexpensive and available materials. This ASI is a successor to similar programs that have been held in Africa, India, and Brazil. The local expenses will be supported by SJTU, and participant expenses as well as administrative costs are sponsored by the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy.\r\nThis workshop will engage leading researchers and well qualified post-doctoral fellows and graduate students with participants from underdeveloped regions in Asia to conduct the table-top experiments as well as to introduce useful computer software to the participants. As has already been demonstrated by the previous Hands-on ASIs, these activities stimulate the curiosity of the participants and raise a variety of interest research questions that they can pursue on their own and in continuing collaborations.  In addition to raising research issues in the study of complex phenomena the institute demonstrates useful and effective methods of scientific education. This experience is beneficial to the young U.S. assistants as much as to the Asian participants.",

Some participants commented that they found the tutorials to be the most valuable part of the Hands-on program. \n\n The participants also had the opportunity to present their scientific work via a poster and an oral \"snapshot\" of their research.  Each participant attended an afternoon tutorial session on poster preparation and oral presentation prior to submitting their poster for printing.  At each of three poster sessions 1/3 of the participants gave a one minute oral presentation (snapshot) of their work to entice the audience to come visit their poster.  The posters and snapshots were judged by their peers and the faculty and 13 awards were given for the best entries.  \n\n \n\nBoth HOS (in China and in Trieste) contributed to the long-term sustainability of the Hands-on concept.
