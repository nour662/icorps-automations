 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Robert Noyce/ Mathematics and Science Teacher Institute (MSTI) at Xavier University of Louisiana goals are to: (1) educate and train Master Teacher Fellows (MTF) to achieve National Board for Professional Teaching Certification in mathematics or science and (2) introduce Teacher Fellows (TF) to the field of mathematics /science education and support their efforts in the high-needs school districts in New Orleans area.  Partners include New Orleans Parish School Districts, ExxonMobil Foundation, the local Audubon Zoo and Aquarium, National Science Teachers Association' and National Mathematics Teachers Association.\r\n\r\nMSTI is recruiting and supporting 10 STEM professionals and/or recent STEM graduates as Teacher Fellows to enroll in the MAT Program and receive licensure and recruiting a cohort of 10 Master Teaching Fellows to participate in professional development seminars with the collaborative partners.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  Noyce/MSTI is increasing the pool of STEM teachers in New Orleans by working with the collaborative partners to provide training and support and giving direct, supervised, organized teaching experiences to both TF and MTF cohorts.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  This proposal is increasing the number of STEM teachers in the high-need New Orleans area.",

Each Teacher Fellow enrolled in a Master of Arts in Teaching program at a univeristy with a teacher preparation program that emphasized inquiry, collaboration, and experimentation. In addition to coursework, particpants attended seminars, and engaged in activities and projects focused on identifying, developing, and integrating effective teaching practices that positively impact students enrolled in high - needs schools.  All of the Teaching Fellows earned a Master of Arts in Teaching degree.  Additionally, each Fellow passed all parts of the Praxis Teacher Licensure Exam, which made them eligible for state certification.\n\nA unique component of the project was the engagement and participation of education and STEM faculty.  Under the guidance of the National Board consultant, faculty formed teams to observe and provide space and time for reflective and intentional feedback designed to improve teh participant's instructional practice.  This model of collaborative school-based coaching supported teachers in the assessment and analysis of instruction based on best practices.\n\nEach team observed Master Teacher Fellows and Teacher Fellows at least twice a semester.

The faculty teams modeled collaborative school-based coaching that helped to provide reflective and intentional feedback to improve classroom practices.  An unintended outcome involved university faculty who self-reported a shift in their approach to teaching university students as a result of particpating in this program.  They too  moved away from lecture to an approach that involved inquiry-based collaborations and student-centered instructional practices.  The two-tiered model was designed to fill a critical shortage of high quality mathematics and science teachers in high - needs schools.
