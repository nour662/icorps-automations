 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the fundamental aspects of vertebrate embryonic development is the transformation of a spherical or disc-shaped embryo into an elongated body with a head at one end and a tail at the other.  Movements of individual cells within the tissues of the early embryo cause the overall narrowing and extension of the body axis, separating the head from the tail with an elongated spinal cord.  How these cell movements are organized and coordinated is not known, and this is a critical question to be answered, as failure of body axis elongation can lead to severe malformations or death of the embryo.  The proposed studies will address this question in mouse embryos, using mice that carry mutations in specific genes that lead to defects in body axis elongation and spinal cord formation. The effects of these mutations on cell movements in the neural tube and notochord, two tissues that contribute to the formation of the spinal cord, will be determined using time-lapse imaging of mutant and normal embryos.  Changes at the subcellular and molecular level within the cells of the neural tube and notochord that affect body axis elongation will be examined using protein biochemistry and immunohistochemistry.  In addition, the relative contribution of cell behavior within individual tissues (neural tube, notochord, somitic mesoderm) to overall body axis elongation will be examined using genetic approaches to target mutations to those specific tissues.  These studies will provide significant new understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating body axis formation, as well as novel insights into the general regulation of complex tissue movements during development. This project will have broader impacts in several ways. On the scientific level it will identify the key elements of body axis elongation and clarify how genetic and environmental factors may influence embryonic development.  On the educational front, it will provide opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, particularly those from under-represented groups, to participate in research, and will provide materials for educational use at all levels (high school, undergraduate, graduate).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of the research supported by this award were to investigate the behavior of cells in the tissues that give rise to the spinal cord and vertebral column, in order to understand how the spinal cord forms properly.  For these experiments we used mouse as a model system, as the mouse is the best characterized, most technically tractable mammalian system, for these experiments.  In addition to normal, wild-type mice, we used two different mouse strains that have mutations causing defects in spinal cord formation, the Ptk7 mutant and the Loop-tail (Lp) mutant.  These two strains carry mutations in genes encoding distinct proteins, one of which (Lp) has been previously implicated in the process of polarizing epithelial cells with respect to the overall tissue polarity, while the function of the other (Ptk7) has not been fully characterized.  Mutation of either of these genes causes the spinal cord to fail to elongate, making it very short and wide, and causes the neural tube to remain open from the hind brain to the tail, failing to close into the normal tube structure required for spinal cord formation.  This defect is known as craniorachischisis, and is a defect known to occur during human development as well, leading to death of the affected infants at birth.\n\nWe used cutting edge imaging techniques to follow cell behavior in living, wild type mouse embryos, and were able to determine that the cells of the neural epithelial tissue, the precursor of the spinal cord, rearrange in a polarized way.  They alter their apical junctional domains to change their interactions with their neighbors such that they are displaced preferentially along the anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis of the embryo, leading to a narrowing and lengthening of the whole tissue.  The changes in the apical junctional domains are accompanied by robust protrusive activity along the basolateral domains of the cells, which is polarized along the mediolateral axis (perpendicular to the head-tail).  We hypothesize that the polarized protrusive activity helps to orient the cells to move in the mediolateral dimension, and this movement causes the whole tissue to narrow and elongate.  The patterns of epithelial cell rearrangement that we saw were overall very similar to those that have been previously seen in elongating tissues in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that there is great conservation of behavior in tissue shaping.  There were significant differences however, as no basolateral protrusive activity has been detected in the fly tissues, and there is much more involvement of cell proliferation in the mouse neural epithelium.\n\nThe mutations in Ptk7 and Lp mice have very different effects on the normal cell behavior.  Cells in the Ptk7 mutant neural epithelium are able to rearrange at a normal rate, but they do not do so in a polarized way - they exhibit a total loss of polarization of cell rearrangement.  This effect is not a loss of all polarity of the cell, as the cells have normal apical-basal polarity, but they move in random directions relative to their neighboring cells.  This leads to failure of preferential narrowing and lengthening of the tissue.  On the other hand, cells in the Lp mutant neural epithelium were polarized normally, but did not rearrange as often, and appeared to lack the dynamics of the normal embryo.  They exhibit a loss of efficiency of rearrangement.  By further examining the patterns of rearrangement in these embryos, we were able to determine that the effect is specific to the apical region of the cells.  We hypothesize that the ability to disassemble and reassemble the junctional protein complexes is affected by the mutation in the Lp mouse embryos.\n\nWe also examined the behavior of cells in another axial tissue that lengthens and narrows at the same time as the neural epithelium, the notochord.  The notochord will eventually form the intervertebral bodies of the spine.  These cells have a different mechani..."
