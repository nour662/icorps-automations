Students are recruited nationwide, with particular emphasis on colleges without research opportunities, and on students belonging to groups traditionally underrepresented in mathematics. Areas of inquiry are expected to include number theory, game theory, combinatorics, and algebra. The primary purpose is to develop and encourage outstanding mathematical talent in the workforce of the 21st century, with a secondary purpose of advancing the frontiers of science by publishing and otherwise disseminating novel mathematical ideas.",
