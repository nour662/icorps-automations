New equipment to be acquired incrementally over the next three years will include: 1) a solid state laser that would be employed for Raman and Brillouin spectroscopic measurements of the elastic and structural properties of hydrous and anhydrous silicate glasses and melts under high temperature and pressure conditions in the laser heated diamond anvil cell (DAC); 2) electronics necessary for ultrasonic measurements of the compressibility of silicate melts in the large volume press; 3) microscopes and computer controlled translation stage for diamond anvil sample loading and micro-Raman scattering experiments; 4) an vibration isolated optical table to support new Raman and Brillouin spectroscopic capabilities; 5) a new power supply for an existing Raman system; 6) equipment to support development of a new spectroradiometric system for measuring temperature in situ in the laser heated diamond anvil cell; and 7) a new control system for an existing Brillouin spectrometer.  The lab upgrade will allow for the collection of new observations of silicate melt elasticity at pressure and the effects of water on melt structure and compressibility.   The lab upgrades will support student and postdoctoral research training in materials characterization methods with implications for supporting the next generation geoscience workforce and the development of synthetic materials for societal and military applications.\r\n\r\n***",
