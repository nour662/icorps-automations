 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches:\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to advance hydrokinetic energy generation by developing methods to increase the power density and minimize the installation and maintenance costs of the generator, power conditioning system, and interface to the utility grid. The approach is to (i) establish the fundamental tradeoff between cost and power delivered of several alternative hydro-generation systems, (ii) explore alternative machine/converter architectures that reduce the installation and maintenance cost/power delivered, and (iii) develop modular, scalable, and efficient power conditioning and interface systems with high power quality.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: This project develops a generalized modular and scalable power conversion structure for further expansion and grid integration of hydrokinetic energy resources. It also establishes a rigorous derivation of the design tradeoffs between several competing technologies that will allow the community to make informed decisions on the architecture that is best suited for a given environment.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The developed technology will help to increase the large-scale installation of hydrokinetic energy conversion systems and will contribute to the growth of the renewable energy sector. The results and outcomes of the proposed research will provide useful design guidance to reduce the cost of grid integration of hydrokinetic energy resources. The educational program will help to educate and equip the next generation of power engineers with the knowledge and skills required to address tomorrow?s energy challenges. This will contribute to local and national green businesses and industries.",
