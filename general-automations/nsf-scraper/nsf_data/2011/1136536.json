 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project we will focus on four important aspects (requirements)\r\nof an end-to-end software environment for performing multiple parallel\r\nnon-rigid registrations over the Grid. Our application is Image Guided\r\nNeurosurgery  (IGNS).  IGNS  is  an important  tool for  neurosurgical\r\nresection which is a  common therapeutic intervention in the treatment\r\nof malignant brain tumors.\r\n\r\nThe  four requirements  we will  study in  this project  are:  (1) the\r\nhigh-performance   of   the   parallel   and   distributed   non-rigid\r\nregistration code  by dynamically balancing  the processors work-load,\r\n(2) the   ease-of-use  from   medical  doctors   (radiologist)   of  a\r\nweb-service by developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for clients\r\nof  our web-service  (3) the  portability of  the code  to run  from a\r\nsingle high-end workstation to  more than one clusters of workstations\r\nwithin  the  local  and  wide  area  networks  available  to  research\r\nhospitals  and medical  centers, (4)  the reliability  by guaranteeing\r\nthat part of  the system will complete the  computations for the image\r\nregistration  and  by making  sure  we  meet  the time  constrains  by\r\nacquiring and  re-configuring the system at runtime  to compensate for\r\nlost (faulty) computing resources.\r\n\r\nThe end-product will  be a prototype of an  IGNS web-service. However,\r\nthis project will have broader  impact to image guided therapy because\r\nthe  same  framework  (but  different modalities  and  finite  element\r\napproximation models)  can be used  in prostate biopsy  and treatment,\r\nand liver cryotherapy.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe basic  research of this project contributes into a broader goal for Research and  Development (R&amp;D) efforts for developing enabling technologies for medical  applications and devices required in personalized medicine for brain cancer,  Parkinson\u00c6s and Alzheimer\u00c6s disease.  We  achieved our objective to develop an accurate, faster, and cheaper core  technology for fusion (or registration) of medical images required in Image  Guided Neurosurgery (IGNS) for brain cancer using commodity computing  resources.  In addition, we started the  evaluation of this technology for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) required for  the treatment of Parkinson\u00c6s disease.\n\nWe delivered an open source software as part of the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK).  ITK is an open-source, cross-platform system that provides developers with an extensive suite of software tools for image analysis.  ITK is funded and supported by NIH\u00c6s National Library of Medicine and it is developed through extreme programming methodologies, it employs leading-edge algorithms for registering and segmenting multidimensional data &ndash;it is used worldwide.  Our paper/software (within less than two years is viewed more about 9,000 times and downloaded about 1,400 times).\n\nThe non-rigid registration method and software we delivered from the basic research of this grant is : (A) more accurate than the current technology used in commercial products (in average more than 3.5 times) and helped us to improve  the accuracy of the state-of-the-art method which is part of the ITK by at least a factor of two, (B) fast enough to meet the time constraints imposed by the neurosurgical procedure and (C) it runs on widely available desktops which are portable and easy to integrate in traditional Operating Rooms.  \n\nHospital adoption rate, for devices that rely on enabling core technologies like the non-rigid registration method we developed in this project, will increase as the cost of intra-operative technologies decreases and the employment of such technologies will reduce medical and hospitalization expenses.  In addition DBS and IGNS procedures in general are expected to increase, since incidents of Parkinson\u00c6s, Alzheimer\u00c6s, and brain cancer are expected to increase with the aging of the US population. Additional broader impact is expected to come from applications in the prostate, liver, and kidney -all under evaluation at top research hospitals. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/07/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nikos P Chrisochoides"
