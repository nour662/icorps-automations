 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intellectual merit of this work derives from the possibility to make some of the most precise and fundamental measurements in physics.  One goal is to make the most precise measurement of the property of an elementary particle -- the electron magnetic moment measured in Bohr magnetons.  A second goal is to test the most successful and fundamental theory of physics, quantum electrodynamics (QED), to an unprecedented level of precision, arguably the most precise comparison of any theory and experiment.   Quantum electrodynamics describes the interaction of matter and light, and it sets the standard to modern particle theories aspire.   A third goal is to make the most precise comparison of a lepton and an antilepton (by a factor of 15 or more), the electron and the positron, as a test of CPT invariance.   A fourth goal is to make the most precise determination of the fundamental fine structure constant.  This constant gives the strength of the electromagnetic interaction in the low energy limit and it characterizes the size of a wide variety of phenomena, ranging from the energy scales in atoms, to the ac Josephson effect, to the quantum Hall effect. In addition, the fine structure constant is one of the crucial measured constants (along with the Rydberg and Planck's constant) for accurately determining the system of basic units that are important to a technological society rooted in science.  A fifth goal is to observe the spin flip of a proton on the way to comparing the magnetic moments of the antiproton and proton a million times more accurately than has previously been possible.  A sixth goal is to investigate the possibility of adapting the precision measurement methods to make the first scalable, one-electron qubit for quantum information studies.\r\n \r\nThe devices and methods that will make these unusually precise measurements possible are interesting in their own right.  They will include a cylindrical Penning trap cavity cooled to 100 mK, quantum nondemolition observations of one-quantum transitions of a single electron, self-excitation of a one-particle oscillator, feedback cooling, inhibition of spontaneous emission, quantum jump spectroscopy of one electron's spin and cyclotron levels and cavity sideband cooling.  The experiments also offer outstanding educational opportunities.  Junior participants who learned their craft doing work in this area are now engaged in research careers in various subfields of physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe \"standard model of particle physics\" - a collection of particles, interactions and symmetries - is our most fundamental description of physical reality.  An electron particle and its antimatter counterpart particle, called the positron, are two of the particles.  The most precise prediction of the standard model is the strength of the electron and positron magnets -- their so-called magnetic moments.  The standard model has been remarkablly successful in making very precise predictions of properties like this.   The great puzzle is that the standard model is spectacularly wrong in some of its most fundamental predictions.  It predicts, for example, that no universe would survive the big bang.  Precise tests of the standard model thus probe one of the most fundamental mysteries of our universe.  \n\nNew methods and apparatus were developed as part of this research program -- one PhD theses at a time.  Elegant techniques were demonstrated that made it possible to probe the lowest quantum energy levels of a single particle in the apparatus.  Eventually, the new methods and new apparatus were used together to measure the electron magnetic moment to an extremely high precision of 3 parts in 10^13.  This remarkably precise measurement is the most precisely measured property of an elementary particle, and it is also the most stringent test of a prediction of the standard model.  In fact, the comparision of the measurement and the prediction is the most precise confrontation of theory and experiment.\n\nDuring the last grant period an elabororate new apparatus was completed in pursuit of two long term goals.
