 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Gregory V. Hartland, Prof. Masaru Kuno and Dr. Libai Huang of the University of Notre Dame in conjunction with graduate and undergraduate student co-workers will use ultrafast transient absorption microscopy to study single nanostructures.  These experiments will be performed with diffraction limited spatial resolution.  The materials that will be examined include II-VI nanowires (such as CdSe nanowires and CdSe/ZnSe core-shell nanowires), metal nanowires (Ag and Au), and carbon nanotubes (both metallic and semiconducting tubes).  For the semiconducting nanostructures, the main goals of the project are to explore how the time scales for charge carrier trapping vary between different nanostructures, how they vary spatially within a given nanostructure, and the role of surface chemistry in these processes.  For the metal nanowires, the investigators will explore how the environment controls energy relaxation.  In particular, the investigators are interested in how liquid properties, such as viscosity, affect vibrational relaxation in these systems. \r\n\r\nDespite extensive studies over the past few decades, many basic questions remain about the sequence of events that follow optical excitation of nanomaterials, and their timescales.  The proposed experiments will provide new insight into these processes.  For example, the investigators will determine how surface properties affect the fate of charge carriers in semiconducting nanostructures, which is important for integrating these materials into devices, such as solar cells.  They will also examine how the elastic response of metal nanowires is affected by environment, which is relevant to the development of ultra-sensitive mass sensors based on these materials.  The measurements of the energy relaxation processes in this project are also relevant to biological imaging and photothermal therapy applications of nanomaterials.  In addition to the broader technological impact of the work, the project will serve as a platform for training graduate and undergraduate students in materials science, chemistry and physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report for the General Public: NSF CHE-1110560, \"Charge carrier relaxation and energy dissipation in one-dimensional nanostructures\"\n\nIn this proposal we have used ultrafast laser spectroscopy to examine the properties of single metal nanostructures.  There have been two main scientific discoveries from the work.  First, we used time-resolved experiments to examine the breathing modes of nanowires suspended over a trench.  The main focus of this work was to measure the lifetimes of these modes, to see how they are affected by viscosity.  Figure 1 shows electron microscopy images of a suspended nanowire, and a time-resolved trace for the nanowire.  The oscillations in the trace are from the breathing modes of the nanowire.  Finite element calculations of the frequencies of the breathing modes are in excellent agreement with the experimental frequencies.  Experiments performed with nanowires in viscous to moderately viscous liquids (glycerol and ethylene glycol) show that these modes are strongly damping by interactions with the liquid.  Calculations of the damping using a regular Newtonian description of the liquid viscosity fail to reproduce the experimental results.  On the other hand, good agreement is obtained when viscoelastic effects are included in the calculations.  This is somewhat unusual, as viscoelasticity is typically not important in simple liquids.\n\nWhether viscoelastic effects are significant or not depends on a parameter called the Deborah number, which is the relaxation time of the liquid multiplied by the frequency of the motion. High Deborah numbers mean solid-like behavior, and low Deborah numbers (fast relaxation times) correspond to liquid-like behavior. Viscoelastic materials display a transition from liquid-like to solid-like behavior with increasing frequency (a well-known example being cornstarch in water: this material feels like a solid for high frequency motions, and a liquid at low frequencies).  The liquids examined in our experiments display viscoelasticity because the breathing modes of nanomaterials have very high frequencies.  These results show that the way materials interact with their environment can be very different for nanoparticles compared to regular, bulk materials.  This work was recently published in Nano Letters (Yu et al., Nano Letters 2015, 15, 3964-3970).\n\nThe second major outcome from this project has been to use the single particle transient absorption measurements developed in our laboratory to examine the motion of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in metal nanostructures.  SPPs are electron oscillations at the surface of a metal that have a well-defined momentum.  They are important in surface enhanced spectroscopies and in developing plasmonic devices, such as logic circuits with sub-wavelength dimensions.  Our experiments provide information about the propagation lengths of the SPP modes, and how these modes couple between nanostructures.  Figure 2 shows an example of an experiment where we observed coupling between two nanostructures.  In these measurements a laser excites the SPP modes at the end of a nanowire (indicated by the arrow) and a second probe laser is scanned over the sample to generate an image.  The SPPs travel down the wire, and when they get to the end they cross over to the nearby nanoplate.  Interestingly, the modes in the nanoplate maintain memory of their initial momentum.  This work was published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry C (Yu et al., J. Phys. Chem. C 2014, 118, 8603-8609).  Analysis of this data gives information about the coupling efficiency, which is important for the design of plasmonic devices.\n\nThe broader impacts of the proposal have mainly been in student training.  Funds from the NSF were used to support the research of a postdoctoral scholar, four graduate students, and six undergraduate students (three from the University of Notre Dame, two from nearby Liberal Arts colleges, and one international student from..."
