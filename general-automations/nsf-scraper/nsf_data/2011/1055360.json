 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to develop optimization-based decision support models to assist emergency managers in planning, training, and operations for logistically complex emergency evacuations; specifically, the research will study both hospital and large-scale regional evacuations.  These two evacuation problems differ from the logistical problems often encountered in industry because risk is an important consideration (evacuations are performed in response to a perceived threat) and they occur infrequently (at least for any particular hospital or region), making appropriate institutional knowledge scarce.  Furthermore, hospital evacuations require decisions that are both medical and logistical in nature, while regional evacuations must consider social issues.  To be successful, both evacuation problems require the integration of multiple processes and the coordination of a large number of resources in an efficient manner. While these problems are distinct, they can both be modeled using novel network formulations that are combinatorial in nature and involve high levels of uncertainty. Furthermore, solutions to both problems require robust, implementable strategies that consider risk. An operations research-based methodology will be used to study these evacuation problems.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will develop models that will improve planning, training, and operational management for these difficult evacuation problems.  This research will be conducted in close collaboration with emergency managers and the other principle players.  This research is important, and widely applicable, the hospital portion also applies to residential care facilities (which serve approximately 2.2 million people in the U.S.).  Furthermore, as coastal populations grow, especially on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, more sophisticated evacuation strategies will be required in response to seasonal hurricane evacuations, among other threats. The educational component of this award will seek to increase graduate school enrollment and diversity, and illustrate to practitioners and policy-makers the value of these decision support models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcome Report\n\nSummary: This project studied decision support models that assist in the planning and training for, and management of, logistically complex emergency responses (e.g., evacuating a hospital or a region in response to a hurricane).  The decision support models produce optimal solutions to emergency scenarios.  What these problems share is a goal to minimize harm, through planning and better operations. These problems were modeled using novel network formulations that are combinatorial in nature, and represent the coordination of scarce resources (e.g., ambulances, roadways, evacuation vehicles), the management of which is essential for a successful response, i.e., a response that minimizes harm.  This research has produced decision support models, as well as collaborations with practitioners. This research is important, and widely applicable, as coastal populations grow, especially on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, more sophisticated evacuation strategies will be required in response to seasonal hurricanes and other threats.\n\nThe following summarizes the major contributions:\n\nHospital and Assisted Living Evacuations:  Evacuating a hospital, or other assisted living setting (i.e., nursing homes) is a resource intensive and logistically complex process.  Major decisions that are required for an evacuation were modeled using a network framework that quickly solvable.  This allows the generation of an evacuation plans for a large size hospital, for a given scenario, is a matter of minutes.  While this is useful for operational management, it is also useful for planning purposes; producing evacuation plans for a hospital for full years? worth of data (number of patients, types of patients, and available regional resources) and derive metrics from the set of optimal plans.  This research was performed in close collaboration with practitioners.\n\nRegional Evacuations: Regional evacuations include both automobile and transit based evacuees.  Both problems are difficult to plan for, and manage.  For car-based evacuees, one of the major problems is congestion, which reduces the ability to evacuate a region by causing traffic flow issues.  To better model this problem, network flow models with congestion were developed and used for evacuation planning.  For transit-based evacuations, models were developed to help schedule and route buses in an evacuation setting.\n\nMass Casualty Incidents: Triaging victims of a mass casualty incident, and then transporting them to regional hospitals is a difficult decision problem, which must take into account transportation resources, hospital capabilities, and the condition of the casualties.   The decisions required for such a response were modeled and optimal solutions were used to gain insights into good management practices. \n\nOperations Research and Management Science:  Innovative modeling frameworks were developed to study an important resource allocation problem in emergency management.  Using this framework, the structure of optimal evacuation policies were studied, considering various objective functions, including equity and robustness.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/16/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas R Bish"
