 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes two distinct threads of research. One thread involves estimation of the distributional components of random effects and mixed effects models, and the other is an investigation of BayesSim, a new and potentially more efficient way of doing statistical simulation studies. Random and mixed effects models are extremely useful statistical models that have wide applications. The investigator studies minimum distance methods for nonparametrically estimating the distributions of the random components of such models. This study includes an investigation of bootstrap methods for placing error bounds on these nonparametric estimates. The investigator also studies the use of minimum distance methods for testing common assumptions, such as normality and independence of random effects and errors, associated with mixed models. Complicated models in the modern statistics world have made simulation the most often used means of investigating new statistical methodology. Almost every simulation study published in a statistics journal proceeds as follows. A few models are selected, hundreds or thousands of data sets are generated from each model, the methodology of interest is applied to every data set, and the results are summarized. A different simulation strategy, called BayesSim, is considered by the investigator. The main idea is to do a better job of sampling all the relevant models. The strategy is to generate one data set (or at most a few data sets) from each of hundreds or thousands of randomly selected models. This approach has the potential of providing more complete information about a statistical method, while doing so at a reduced computational cost relative to the traditional simulation method.\r\n\r\nRandom effects models are often used for microarray data in genetics. Determining whether certain genes express more for diseased patients than for healthy ones is often the goal of a microarray study. The incorrect specification of distributions in the random effects model could mean that such genes go undetected. Part of the research in this proposal is aimed at improving methods of determining these distributions. Mixed effect models are used in small area estimation, an enor- mously important technique in the field of survey sampling. Estimation of quantities in small areas, such as counties, from surveys taken in the small area are often unreliable, due to small sample sizes. Small area techniques use information from nearby larger areas to infer or predict quantities of interest in the small area. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau has a special program, called Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, that provides more current estimates of certain income and poverty statistics than those from the most recent decennial census. Small area estimates made by the U.S. Census Bureau affect allocation of federal funds to local jurisdictions, and hence have a major impact on U.S. society. The investigator's research on random and mixed effects models could improve methods for small area estimation. BayesSim has the potential of improving the answers obtained from any statistical simulation study, and hence could have a large impact on the entire field of statistics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe outcomes of my research supported by this NSF grant have potential applications in at least two important areas: genetic studies and quality control.  Biologists use microarray analysis and proteomics to learn how genes are associated with disease.  This knowledge helps to identify drugs that may be effective in the treatment of diseases.  Part of my research can be used to improve the statistical analysis of data arising from microarray analyses.  More specifically, my research can improve the process of statistical testing that is used to identify genes that may be associated with a particular disease. \n\nIn industry, statistical quality control methods are used to monitor production processes, to make sure that product quality measures are in line with what the manufacturer intends. For example, suppose a machine produces a part that is supposed to be of a specified length, plus or minus some small margin of error.  Parts are rapidly produced and their lengths measured.  A statistical test is used to signal if the process is out of control, meaning that the parts are deviating from the specified length.  It is important that the test sounds an alarm as quickly as possible when the process is out of control, since time and money will be lost when bad parts are produced.  Part of my research has led to a new statistical test that is an improvement over one of the most commonly used tests in quality control.  \n\nTwo important areas of statistics are regression analysis and times series, areas with applications in a wide variety of settings, including agriculture, sociology, oceanography and engineering.  Regression is widely applicable since it is methodology for a ubiquitous problem, namely studying the relationship between two sets of variables.  Often scientists have no knowledge of the specifics of a such a relationship, in which case nonparametric regression techniques are useful.  For a certain type of relationship between variables, one of the outcomes of my research leads to an improvement over existing nonparametric regression methodology. \n\nTime series is the study of processes that are observed across time, such as daily high temperatures.  Often such processes are periodic, meaning that characteristics of the process tend to repeat themselves over time.  Temperatures are a good example.  Within a year, say December 21, 2014 to December 20, 2015, temperatures follow a certain pattern in a given area.  They are highest in summer and lowest in winter.  This same pattern will roughly repeat itself in each subsequent year, and so the temperatures are said to have a one year period.  Sometimes periodic behavior in a time series is more subtle, and hence difficult to identify.  One of the outcomes of my research has been the development of new methods to improve the quality of statistical estimates of period length. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/19/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey D Hart"
