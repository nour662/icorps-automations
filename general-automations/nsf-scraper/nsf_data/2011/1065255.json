 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching question that Scale, Consumers and Lotic Ecosystem Rates (SCALER) will address is: How can small-scale ecological experiments be applied to understand the behavior of entire ecological systems? Funds are provided to address:: 1) How should measures of fundamental properties of streams and effects of animals on those properties be scaled up to predict ecosystem characteristics of stream networks. 2) How do patterns of scaling compare across the wide array of ecological systems (from tundra to tropical forest) that occurs across North American? The SCALER experiment will be done in tropical forest, temperate mountainous forest, prairie, northern boreal evergreen forest, and tundra areas. Streams in each of these five areas will be examined at scales of centimeters to 10?s of meters in small, medium and large streams.  Rates of stream metabolism (photosynthesis and respiration) and nutrient uptake will be measured as well as the way these rates respond to animal exclusions (used to mimic loss of animal diversity in streams). These local results will be linked to the scale of watersheds and regions by modeling. Watershed scale predictions will be verified by broader, but less intensive sampling. Mechanistic explanation of how ecological measurements and experiments in streams can be scaled to watersheds will be provided. This scaling will be characterized in each of the five areas across the continent to explore how scaling differs across natural habitats.  The knowledge that will be generated by this project is essential to quantify controls on stream ecosystem processes as well as to manage human impacts on entire watersheds. The experimental and modeling results will be relevant to general ecology because few nested, and experimental and theoretically coupled scaling experiments have been undertaken in any environment. Results will inform those involved in conservation, management, and restoration of freshwater resources. Resource managers will gain a quantitative rationale and framework to link local measurements to regional patterns. The highly collaborative team will train six graduate students, five post doctoral students, and mentor three early career faculty members. Additional collaborations will be encouraged to collaborate and perform similar projects at additional sites through workshops related to the objectives and research design.",

These are essential ecosystem processes that control water quality and support the diversity of animals in freshwaters. We made these determinations across biomes at sites in Puerto Rico (tropical forest), North Carolina (deciduous temperate forest), Kansas (tallgrass prairie), Oregon (temperate rain forest), Alaska (tundra and boreal forest), and in Australia (tropical forest). The project has intellectual merit because stream scientists are usually restricted to sampling over scales of centimeters to several hundred meters, yet processes occurring at the watershed scale are more relevant to the way streams function in the environment and how people interact with them. We were able to capture the whole watershed by sampling many points in each watershed in each biome, and creating models to scale to the whole watershed. The project has further merit because these ecosystem processes and their interaction with animals might vary across the country and around the world. Our experimental design included sites from tropical rain forests to tundra, allowing very broad understanding and comparison of stream ecology. As such, we created a conceptual model of how streams are expected to vary with respect to ecosystem processes and organism diversity across the globe. We also found that animal effects only occurred at relatively high animal densities, and that these high densities only occurred in some locations of watersheds and only in some biomes. We improved methods to measure algal biomass.&nbsp; We documented how flow alters material (such as nitrogen and carbon) flux from streams and how thresholds exist with respect to instream processing of these materials.

These results relate to water quality, fisheries production, biodiversity protection, and other ecosystem services provided to humanity.
