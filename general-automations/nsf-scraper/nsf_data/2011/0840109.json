The work also will emphasize \r\nlittle-known (or small) early expeditions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed volume would comprehensively document the history and current status of a key element of the logistics network that makes science possible on the southernmost continent and fill a gap in the existing published record on the topic; currently there exists just one book on Antarctic aviation, which is both out-of-print and dated.\r\n\r\nA second existing work focuses on one specific Naval-aviation unit and is therefore very limited in scope, relative to the topic of Antarctic aviation generally.\r\n\r\n",
