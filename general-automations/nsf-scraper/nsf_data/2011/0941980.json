 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States must retain more students in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines to maintain a skilled workforce. Retention is often lower in the STEM undergraduate majors when compared to other majors, especially for underrepresented minorities. Research indicates that living-learning communities (i.e., specialized learning dorms), as well as mentorship through undergraduate research, increases student retention and strengthens the overall academic experience. These two models have been combined to form the Learning Environment and Academic Research Network (LEARN).  LEARN aims to increase retention in STEM disciplines by identifying at-risk, first-year students and provides the opportunity to join a learning community, in which they live, take courses, apprentice in research laboratories with faculty and graduate students, and interact as a group. The LEARN participants become part of a four-year research network where they find mentorship throughout their academic experience. The LEARN program is student-learning centered to provide the skills and confidence to continue their education in STEM disciplines. The program reaches approximately 120 undergraduate (participants and peer mentors) and graduate (research mentors) students in three years. Data collected through program assessment provides details regarding the best practices to increase student retention in the STEM disciplines. Assessment results are disseminated widely.",
