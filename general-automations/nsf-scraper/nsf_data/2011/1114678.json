 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pathways proposal seeks to find the most effective means for communicating research, research processes and ocean sciences to the public from the ocean ship Joides Resolution (JR). The JR is an NSF-supported research vessel that assists scientists and educators in their quest for understanding the science of oceans and ocean floors worldwide. The goal of this project is to find the best mechanism for communicating science through the numerous platforms of informal science education.\r\n\r\nThrough a series of discussions by stakeholders that include scientists, educators, end-users in the informal science education community and evaluators, 3-5 pilot projects will be selected for further elaboration, testing and evaluation for communication methodologies. From these studies and refinements, models for communication will be produced for further implementation. Partners in this venture include: Consortium for Ocean Leadership's Deep Earth Academy (DEA)and the Education Division for the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).\r\n\r\nThis project will enhance the public's understanding of oceans, ocean floors, and related research in these elements, and inspire younger individuals who may consider ocean science as a career. Models for how best to communicate the world of ocean science will be tested and disseminated through informal science education networks and platforms. Further, models for evaluation of this multidisciplinary science endeavor will be  helpful to advancing the informal science education field.",
