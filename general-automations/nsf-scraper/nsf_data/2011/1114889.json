 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project \"Hybrid methods for the time domain integral equations of electromagnetics\" advances a multidisciplinary program consisting of basic numerical analysis of time domain integral equations (TDIEs) and a two-fold program of hybridization.  The basic numerical analysis is devoted to issues of sparsification, quadrature error, error estimates and fast solvers for a new and exciting class of TDIE methods based on convolution quadrature (CQ-TDIE). The first prong of the hybridization work concerns combining CQ-TDIE with the volume finite element method.  Not only would this hybridization allow for the easy simulation of inhomogeneous and complex media, but it also raises the tantalizing prospect of a perfect time domain integral based boundary condition. The second, and more speculative, hybridization approach  combines CQ-TDIE with older Galerkin-based techniques with the aim of controlling dispersion and dissipation.  It is anticipated that the resulting hybrid methods have the stability and spatial accuracy of CQ, but with the greater efficiency and reduced dispersion associated with Galerkin approaches.  In particular, the technique would be ideally suited for the analysis of certain classes of modern technology involving long propagation distances through homogeneous regions (as occur in electromagnetic interference analysis) or mechanically moving parts (as necessary in many nanotechnology problems).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerical simulation of physical processes reduces business prototyping costs, enables the safe prediction of the outcome of dangerous experiments, and can even make scientific discoveries by illuminating internal processes difficult to examine in the laboratory.  In an era dominated by personal communication technology, the simulation of electromagnetic phenomena becomes especially crucial. \"Hybrid methods for the time domain integral equations of electromagnetics\" creates two new methods for the simulation of the interaction between electromagnetic fields and matter.  While computerized approaches to electromagnetic analysis already exist, the methods to be created by the investigators allow for more accurate and efficient simulation of problems involving biological tissue, long propagation distances (such as occur in communications simulations), and mechanically moving parts (as needed in nanotechnology simulations).  In addition to these benefits, the new method represents an important mathematical advance: it is based on a technique thought unstable for over three decades, which has only recently been made practical.  The investigators therefore expect that the advances made in the analysis of electromagnetic problems under the auspices of this work will be easily translated to other scientific areas including acoustics, solid mechanics, and fluid mechanics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSimulations of electromagnetic phenomena such as light and radio waves can aid in the design and testing of products ranging from lenses to antennas to RFID chips.  While simulation is generally cheapter than building and testing electromagnetic products, the creation of computer programs to do the simulation involves much complex mathematical analysis and computer programming.  Such simulations come in many different varieties, and like all complex products of engineering, different choices give rise to computer programs with different benefits and deficiencies.\n\nThe project \"Hybrid Methods for the Time Domain Integral Equations of Computational Electromagnetics\" studied a particular method for electromagnetic simulation.  \"Time domain\" means that the method under study simulated the phenomenon as it unfolded in time, rather than assuming that the phenomenon was limited to a single frequency.  In the context of electromagnetics, \"integral equation\" means that the numerical methods sought to find the electrical currents flowing on an object, rather than the fields they created which fill space.\n\nBecause of these properties, time domain integral equation (TDIE) based simulation methods are very good for the simulation of nonlinear effects (as would occur in electronic equipment or the outer outmospher of the earth) and time varying problems (such as the scattering of electromagnetic energy from the ocean).  They are also typically more efficient than other methods when the object being studied is conductive, or made of homegeneous material.  On the other hand, the methods would be less efficient for the simulation of the interaction of electromagnetic waves with inhomogeneous matter, or matter excited by a monochromatic source of energy.\n\nDespite the obvious potential usefulness of this combination of benefits and deficiencies, TDIE-based simulation programs are not currently commercially available.  Early computer implementations of TDIE-based schemes tended to be inaccurate and inefficient, and worse yet, unstable: They would provide results that would oscillate wildy between ever-increasing limits, rendering the simulations useless.  While the past two decased have seen several methods for solving these difficulties, these methods too have their merits and demerits.\n\nOne of the most exciting new methods for producing stable TDIE-based simulations is based on a method of modelling time called convolution quadrature (CQ).  CQ had several advantages over its competetors: It easily simulates materials that behave differently at different frequencies, and has properties that renders it easy to produce a simulation that is mathematically provably stable.  (Materials that behave differently at different frequencies are called dispersive.)  It also has drawbacks: it is generally more computationally expensive then its main competitors (the so-called \"temporal Galerkin\" (TG) methods), and it produces a numerical kind of dispersion that appears even if the material simulated is not dispersive.  (This is especially problematic, since all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed in a vacuum.  Electromagnetically, air is not very different from vacuum.)\n\nIn this project, we devised a method of combining the benefits of CQ and TG so that the stability and accuracy of CQ could be preserved, but the dispersion and computational load induced by CQ could be reduced.  The method is also as stable as the original CQ method.  This creation is novel in itself, and of interest for this reason to the communities of mathematicians and engineers who study such things.  \n\nThe broader impact of the work itself is twofold: First, though the implementations produced for this project involved electromagnetics, other simulation methods for other physical waves (such as acoustic waves or water waves) can directly apply the approach discovered.  Second, the new method has potential important applications in the study of communication through the upper..."
