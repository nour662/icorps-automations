The program provides students with a cutting-edge educational and research experience that: (1) leads students to independent, original research that is interdisciplinary in nature and has high potential for benefits for society, (2) allows students to experience first-hand the value of collaborative research and teaches the means of effective research communication, (3) encourages and enables the participants to form lasting and broadly cast professional networks with senior students, post-docs, and faculty mentors, (4) fosters diversity in the student population, and (5) provides students who have otherwise limited access to genuine research opportunities with new and potentially career-changing experiences.\r\n\r\nThe program provides scientific training for a diverse and globally competitive work force and it educates and mentors early career students to become leaders in research and development in fields of importance to society. The program actively recruits underrepresented minorities into the STEM fields, and provides students who have limited access to research resources with opportunities to conduct original research with the leaders in the field and at state-of-the-art facilities. The I-MIRTHE REU inspires a new generation of engineering professionals to enter and remain in the STEM fields and conduct groundbreaking research and development to the benefit of society.",

In addition to carrying out cutting-edge research projects, the students experienced the value of collaborative research, i.e. \"that the whole can be more than the sum of its parts\", and practiced effective communication methods by interacting and meeting with their peers at all six MIRTHE research universities, virtually through the web and in person at the week-long MIRTHE Summer Workshop, held at the end of each summer\u00c6s program.\n\nActivities and Findings\n\nThe 2011-2014 I-MIRTHE REU Site program was conducted as a 9-week intensive summer research experience, from early June to early August each year.  The I-MIRTHE REU students conducted original research and were directly embedded into the respective faculty\u00c6s research group.  The students interacted with each other, on a daily basis within each location, and on a weekly basis across locations &ndash; through in person meetings and web-conferences, respectively.  These web-conferences included lectures by faculty on MIRTHE related topics as well as short presentations by the students to update each other on their individual summer research projects.  During the 9th week, the annual week-long MIRTHE Summer Workshop was held and the I-MIRTHE REU students gave presentations about their work &ndash; short oral \"flash-presentations\", followed by extensive poster presentations with fellow students, faculty, and industry collaborators in attendance. \n\nOver this award period, 46 individual undergraduate students participated in the programs at the six MIRTHE locations (Princeton University, Rice University, Johns Hopkins University, Texas A&amp;M University, the City College of New York and the University of Maryland Baltimore County), under the guidance of 20 MIRTHE faculty; 6 students participated in two summers, bringing the total number of internships for this project to 52.   The students were recruited through fliers, which were sent to several hundred academic institutions across the U.S; the official MIRTHE website; through targeted advertising at professional and society conferences (McNair, NSBE, SACNAS, and SWE), as well as partnering LSAMP programs; by direct faculty-to-student recruiting; and by word-of-mouth. The program recruited underrepresented minorities into the STEM fields, and provided students with otherwise limited access to research resources with opportunities to conduct original research with the leaders in the field and at state-of-the-art facilities.  The I-MIRTHE REU inspired a new generation of engineering professionals to enter and remain in the STEM fields and conduct groundbreaking research and development to the benefit of society.\n\nThe diversity of the I-MIRTHE REU students in this award period is given in the table below:\n\nREU student diversity\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal number\n\n\nMale\n\n\nFemale\n\n\nAfrican American\n\n\nNative American, Pacific Islander\n\n\nHispanic American\n\n\n\n\nMIRTHE   &ndash; REU Students 2011\n\n\n15\n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nMIRTHE   &ndash; REU Students 2012\n\n\n15\n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nMIRTHE   &ndash; REU Students 2013\n\n\n15\n\n\n6\n\n\n9\n\n\n4\n\n\n0\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nMIRTHE   &ndash; REU Students 2014\n\n\n7\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Diversity of I-MIRTHE REU participants for 2011 - 2014.\n\nDuring this award period, MIRTHE applied for and received a supplement award to host a student, Ms. Andrea Amati, who required American Sign Lan..."
