 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is expanding workforce preparation for water quality operators in the environmental technology industry through a partnership of Red Rocks Community College with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Regis University, Western State College, and the Colorado State University-Global Campus.  It is producing a statewide training network that expands access to workforce preparation for water quality management technicians by: 1) developing and adapting curricula for online delivery that is supported by a mobile hands-on learning lab; 2) providing outreach and mentorship for the inclusion of women in the industry; and 3) establishing seamless career pathways through articulation agreements with 4-year institutions that lead to accelerated, dual and concurrent enrollment bachelors and masters degree programs. The project is engaging industry experts to define sustainability competencies for the twenty-first century water workforce, to develop and enhance curricula, and to refine instructional strategies. More specifically, the project is adapting water quality management foundational courses to include the industry-identified competencies; developing continuing education coursework to facilitate incumbent worker skills upgrades; adapting a water quality management degree program for online delivery that is being enhanced by the mobile training lab; and establishing a regional hands-on training network through partnerships with business and industry. As a result, the project is producing 1) updated course materials that prepare students to understand the importance of sustainability for the water industry; 2) enhanced entrance and persistence of women in the water quality management program; 3) increased enrollment in the water quality management degree program; 4) increased attainment of Class A and B water and wastewater licenses by incumbent workers; 5) the establishment of transfer agreements with colleges and universities; and 6) the establishment of a cadre of trained instructors to deliver online and regional hands-on training.  Collectively, these efforts are developing pathways into advanced education required by an increasingly complex industry, and producing a more diverse pool of highly qualified water quality technicians.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRed Rocks Community College is preparing to offer Colorado\u00c6s first Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Water Quality Management with the help from the National Science Foundation.  Originally, the college used NSF funds to redesign all of the Water Quality Management (WQM) Associate of Applied Science courses.  Efforts focused on converting courses from static lectures, to blended online coursework with face to face classroom experiences.  The College (RRCC) leveraged funding from the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College Career Training (TAACCCT) program to experiment with alternative course delivery methods with great success.  Surveys indicated a preference for accelerated or hybrid/blended courses that better matched a student\u00c6s hectic schedule, and now half of all WQM courses meet this demand.  Instructors enthusiastically supported the new schedule as well, with many asking to teach the weekend courses.  NSF funds paid for instructor training specifically targeting lesson-planning and adapting instruction for accelerated courses.\n\nThe mobile learning laboratory provided the backbone for many alternative courses.   Weighing just under 5 tons, this full wet-lab traveled to all corners of Colorado with a full contingent of instructors and lab assistants.  It also served as an alternative classroom space when the actual classroom labs were under construction.  In total, the lab supported course work every semester, including noncredit summer courses, from the day it rolled into the WQM parking lot.\n\nLate in the grant, RRCC was presented with a unique opportunity to expand on the accomplishments made with NSF funding by creating a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Water Quality Management. The Colorado Legislature passed Senate Bill 14-004 giving community colleges the authority to offer four-year Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degrees.  RRCC was asked by the Colorado Community College System to pursue a BAS in Water Quality.  RRCC requested and was approved for a no-cost grant extension allowing RRCC to shift remaining NSF grant funds from developing articulation agreements with 4-year colleges to conceptualizing a BAS for the Water Quality Program.\n\nRRCC kicked-off the BAS develop process by hosting a regional meeting for NSF center ATEEC.  The purpose of the meeting was to identify a broad range of career opportunities in water related fields.  Invitees included industry representatives from industry, labor, workforce development, government, and education representatives knowledgeable about trends and needs directly related to the emerging workforce demands for technicians in water management areas.  Building on the momentum from the ATEEC meeting, RRCC hosted its own Water Industry Summit to investigate industry interest in the BAS, and make curriculum recommendations.  Ten different industries and four different higher education institutions gave recommendations on appropriate BAS courses and course content.  Outcomes from these meetings drove BAS course design, and course outlines were approved by the RRCC curriculum committee and ultimately approved by the state curriculum committee within six month of the no-cost extension approval.\n\n \n\nA few months after the BAS courses were given official common course numbers, the Colorado Community College System Board met and approved the BAS degree as did the Colorado Commission of Higher Education. The Higher Learning Commission application was submitted and is awaiting approval.   RRCC anticipates offering BAS courses in the fall semester 2016 with the first graduates in 2018. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kelly Circle"
