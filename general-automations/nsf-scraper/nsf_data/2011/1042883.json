 "awd_abstract_narration": "1042883/Mayewski\r\n\r\nThis award supports a project to analyze a deep ice core which will be drilled by a New Zealand research team at Roosevelt Island. The objectives are to process the ice core at very high resolution to (a) better understand phasing sequences in Arctic/Antarctic abrupt climate change, even at the level of individual storm events; (b) determine the impact of changes in the Westerlies and the Amundsen Sea Low on past/present/future climate change; (c) determine how sea ice extent has varied in the area; (d) compare the response of West Antarctica climate to other regions during glacial/interglacial cycles; and (e) determine how climate of the Ross Sea Embayment changed during the transition from Ross Ice Sheet to Ross Ice Shelf.  The intellectual merit of the RICE deep ice core project is that it is expected to provide a 30kyr long (and possibly 150kyr long) extremely high-resolution view of climate change in the Ross Sea Embayment Region and data essential to test and understand critical questions that have emerged as a consequence of the recent synthesis of Antarctic and Southern Ocean climate change presented in the Scientific Commission for Antarctic Research document: Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment (ACCE, 2009).  Ice core processing and analysis will be performed jointly by University of Maine and the collaborators from New Zealand.  Co-registered sampling for all chemical analyses will be accomplished by a joint laboratory effort at the IGNS NZ ice core facility using a continuous melter system developed by the University of Maine. The RICE deep ice core record will provide information necessary in unraveling the significance of multi-millennial underpinning for climate change and in the understanding of observed and projected climate change in light of current dramatic human impact on Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. The broader impacts of the project include the fact that two CCI graduate students will be funded through the project, and will be involved in all aspects of field research, core sampling, sample processing, analytical and numerical analyses, data interpretation, writing of manuscripts, and presentation of results at national and international conferences.  Data and ideas developed in this project and associated work will be used in several courses taught at the University of Maine. Innovative cyberinfrastructure will be incorporated into this work and ground breaking analytical technologies, and data access/storage tools will be used.",

The following focuses on scientific contributions stemming from NSF grant 1042883 awarded to the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine.\n\nOur project contributed to the age dating of the RICE ice core through a combination of: annual layer counting based on seasonality in chemical signals using standard melt sampling technology; identification of volcanic events using newly developed tephra identification techniques since the site\u00c6s proximity to marine sources of sulfur swamped the volcanic sulfur record; and for the first time ever in an Antarctic ice core the use of ultra high resolution laser ablation sampling that increases sampling resolution by 2-3 orders of magnitude, allowing highly compressed annual layers heretofore too finely spaced to be interpretable at sub-seasonal scale.  \n\nThe location of the RICE ice core makes it highly suitable for monitoring the interaction between the Southern Ocean and the edge of the West Antarctic ice sheet. As such the RICE ice core appears to reveal more climate variability, in terms of changes in the strength of the Amundsen Sea Low and the westerlies, than that recorded in other West Antarctic deep ice core sites drilled farther inland.\n\nImmediately seaward of the RICE drill site is the Ross Sea Polynya (RSP), an open water area in the sea ice that flanks the Ross Ice Shelf.  Our project developed the first proxy for changes in the extent of a polynya, in this case the RSP.  Polynyas have relevance to climate studies because they release ocean heat to the atmosphere, absorb CO2, contain unique ecosystems, and are believed to be open as a consequence of katabatic (gravity driven) cold winds that emanate from higher regions of the ice sheet.  Anthropogenic forcing is believed to have caused the disappearance of the Weddell Sea Polynya and the RSP is currently at its smallest size relative to the last 1150 years. \n\nThe RICE deep ice core in combination with other West Antarctic ice cores offers insights into the history of natural and anthropogenic source emissions entering coastal regions of Antarctica.  Recent pollutant levels and marine (warm) air mass invasion into West Antarctica is unsurpassed over at least the last 60,000 to 100,000 years covered by these records.  Therefore, RICE and other Antarctic ice core records provide a venue for assessing the interaction of natural and human forced climate variability and the significance of tropical-polar, marine and atmosphere interactions.\n\nWest Antarctica is a highly vulnerable area with respect to past and future ice mass loss and therefore has the potential for notable sea level contribution in a warming climate.  Although not yet finalized it is expected that the RICE core will offer critical insights into the massive ice loss that occurred during the last deglaciation (Meltwater Plse 1A 13.000-14,600 yeas ago, 20 m in less than 500 years). This natural analog for massive warming has significance in terms of understanding future ice loss due to warming.\n\nThis project provided information and partial support for on-going synthesis of results summarized in the SCAR Antarctic Climate Change and Environment annual updates and as such scientific perspective for emerging results related to Antarctica\u00c6s role in the global climate system.  One of the scientific issues raised from these syntheses is the question of future changes in atmosphere-ocean circulation that will occur as greenhouse gas warming continues and the Antarctic ozone hole heals.  Climate models and past climate records differ with the former suggesting poleward migration of a strengthened, more zonal westerly system and the latter suggestin..."
