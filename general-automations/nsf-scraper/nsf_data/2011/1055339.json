 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Mark Steinmetz of Marquette University for synthesis and investigation of biological activity of photoreleased anionic metabolites. The goal of the research is to develop a series of robust caged benzothiophene carboxamides that, when exposed to long wavelength visible light, will undergo a 6-pi electrocyclic ring closing reaction that simultaneously expels an anion of biological importance. This controlled release can be used to manipulate the metabolite levels, pH, and/or the redox states inside cells. The methodology can be extended to create photo-removable protective groups in organic synthesis and in the synthesis of bio-oligomers.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the research include the multidisciplinary training opportunities for students, from organic synthesis to photochemistry and assessing the regulation of cellular processes via metabolic uptake. There are potential benefits to chemistry, biology, and medical science because of the generality of the methodology and the potential for temporal and spatial controlled release, for example, of ions across membranes through ion channels. Professor Steinmetz has an excellent track record of ethnic diversity in his research group.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF project on photoremovable protecting groups based on electrocyclic reactions progressed significantly towards accomplishing the goal of releasing biological agents as leaving groups by photolysis with visible (relatively low energy) light.  The research developed effective syntheses that constructed photoremovable protecting groups that contained a light absorbing moiety tethered to various thiophene ring systems via a carboxamide spacer.  Synthetic procedures were developed to provide suitable sites on the thiophene ring for the attachment of a variety of light releasable leaving groups (LG-) such as chloride, carboxylates (RCO2-), and thiolates (RS-) that span a 4-10 pKa range of the LG-H conjugate acids.  ROPO22- is also expected to be attachable for later light induced release.  The types of LG- functional groups are common functional groups present in biological agents such as peptides, proteins, neurotransmitters, and nucleotides.\n\nThe photolysis wavelength used was 385 nm, which is available from a sunlamp or standard photochemical light sources.  Upon project completion, 450 &ndash; 470 nm light will be usable for LG- release.  The chemical yields of released LG-H were 100% or 60%, depending on the thiophene ring system tethered to the light absorber.  The type of thiophene ring system also governed the efficiency of product formation with respect to light utilization.  The reaction was 3.5% to 8.2% efficient.  The likely limit is 32% efficiency, which was achievable when the excited state is initially localized on the thiophene ring system.  The efficiency was lower when the excitation energy must be transferred from the light absorber to the thiophene ring system and was found to depend on the relative energies of the light absorber excited state and that of the thiophene ring system.  Higher efficiencies are expected to be achieved upon completion of the project, once a thiophene ring system that has a lower energy excited state is incorporated into the photoremovable protecting group.\n\nThe project provided education and training for five graduate students, two who graduated with PhD degrees, and three who are still performing research for their doctoral degrees, and three undergraduate students, who have since graduated with BS degrees in chemistry to pursue their own graduate degrees in chemistry.  All of the students were trained in organic synthesis.  The graduate students had sufficient time to become highly proficient and independent and had greater opportunity for classroom instruction in organic synthesis.  The graduate students also received academic training in physical organic chemistry and photochemistry and have had or are receiving laboratory training in practical experimental organic photochemistry.  The graduate students have been a diverse group of three female two male (four Asian, one African).  Two graduate students received Ph.D. degrees and went to USDA research labs (M Sarker, T Shahrin).  Of the remaining three, two plan to obtain academic positions in their home countries (H. Jayasekara and G. Ndzeidze) and one (L Li) plans to enter the chemical industry in the U.S.\n\nThus far the results have been disseminated as a full paper and a patent and one of the photoremovable protecting groups is available though the Aldrich Chemical Co catalog.  The excited state multiciplicity was found to be triplet, and the triplet excited state potential surface from reactant to product was almost entirely elucidated computationally by a collaborator (Q Timerghazin) and included with our experimental findings in the full paper.  At least three additional full papers by graduate students are planned for publication upon completion of the project.  These international students have gained proficiency in writing extensive reports on their research and their preliminary dissertations and will continue the process in writing the papers in collaboration with the PI.  Each has also gained experience in oral p..."
