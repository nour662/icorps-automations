The Inuit Studies Conference is a premier international forum attended by over 500 Arctic scholars that includes Inuit representatives from Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Ruissia, and this is the first time it will be hosted by the United States.   The five day conference will cover a wide range of topics including: indigenous knowledge in understanding global environmental change; international cooperation in Arctic research; the roles of museums and museum collections in preserving Inuit languages, heritage and cultures; Arctic governance and more.  The conference planning agenda includes robust public engagement through musical performances, literature and poetry readings, a film festival, evening lectures for the public, and exhibits in Inuit Art, photography, and science.   In addition, a website will be developed that will not only publicize and facilitate the conference but will ultimately provide educational materials and opportunities for students and teachers.",
