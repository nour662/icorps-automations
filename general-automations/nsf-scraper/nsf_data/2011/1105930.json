 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will use asteroseismic data of stellar pulsations to test models of stellar evolution. As part of this effort, Dr. Basu and a postdoctoral associate will test whether the internal structure and underlying physics of the most stellar evolution theory is correct. Dr. Basu will also use asteroseismology data to obtain masses, radii, effective temperatures, helium abundances, log g(surface gravity) and convection zone sizes in stars. In particular, her team will use data on the large separation and frequency of maximum oscillation for numerous stars provided by the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium  to determine how gross properties of the models should vary across the HR diagram. \r\n\r\nThis work will extend well beyond stellar astrophysics because stars are used to calibrate both time and distance scales in the Universe and if the stellar models are incorrect, this would have many cosmological implications. This will also involve the training of a postdoctoral research associate.",
