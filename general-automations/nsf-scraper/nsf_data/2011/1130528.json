 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this grant is to elucidate failure mechanisms of solvent-filled thin films for use in micro-patterning applications.  Solvent-filled thin film systems such as sol-gels are frequently vulnerable to cracking during the drying process, and failure is difficult to predict due to evolving film mechanical properties.  In this study, failure criteria will be determined via two non-contact experimental methods specifically tailored towards ultra thin film studies: laser spallation adhesion tests and fluorescence-based digital image correlation measurements.  Experimental results will then provide the input data for a finite-element model to predict failure characteristics for more complicated loading regimes.  \r\n\r\nA mechanics-based analysis for predicting failure onset for solvent-filled thin film systems will provide valuable information to the multiple disciplines that utilize microfabrication techniques.  In particular, this work will improve reliability assessment and failure prediction for industrial spray coating applications.  Additionally, the ability to control thin film crack formation, width, and density will provide the foundation for a potentially transformative micro-patterning method, offering a low-cost technique for creating hierarchically distributed micro-scale networks.  In addition to providing educational development opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students through intensive research experiences, this work will be integrated into a module for the INSPIRE Program at the University of Louisville, an established summer enrichment program for local high school students targeted towards groups currently unrepresented in engineering.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThrough adjustment of the adhesion and mechanical properties of solvent-filled thin films, cracking patterns with controllable microscale features have been produced.  Mechanical measurements of thin film adhesion on different treated substrates was performed using a unique, laser spallation method.  Results of the adhesion testing were used to help predict cracking behavior of the drying thin films and compared with experimental observations.  For this, a new image analysis algorithm was created to track the path and grow for multiple cracks at the same time.\n\n \n\nThe crack patterns generated experimentally in this work were used as a template to dictate the placement of a nanoscale reinforcing material, specifically carbon nanotubes, to make composite films.  With improved control of the distribution of nanoscale reinforcing material, composites with enhanced macroscale properties can be realized.  The benefit of the developed patterning process is that it does not require specialized equipment, such as a cleanroom, to achieve comparable microscale resolutions.  This procedure shows the proof-of-concept for economical, large-scale manufacturing of nanocomposite films.\n\n \n\nThroughout this project, 3 different PhD students and 4 undergraduate students have participated in the experimental research.  In addition, this project has supported educational outreach efforts with high school students through engineering activities programming at the Louisville Free Public Library and the INSPIRE summer camp at the University of Louisville.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas Berfield"
