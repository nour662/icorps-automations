 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is grounded in land change science research, which combines the social and the physical aspects of environmental change, in an effort to better understand the complex coupled human-environment relationship. As a result of increasing global environmental impacts (e.g. climate change and the loss of biodiversity) from humans transforming the environment (e.g. through deforestation and degradation), solutions have been proposed to slow down the rate at which the environment is being altered, while at the same time seeking win-win solutions for sustainable development. Payments for Environmental Services (PES) and Reducing Emissions from Degradation and Deforestation (REDD) were proposed by the international community as a means of achieving this double goal of protecting the environment, while, at the same time, improving the livelihoods of the traditional people that often depend heavily on the environment for much of their livelihood. This project will be based in the Korup National Park (KNP) in Cameroon, and seeks to answer the following questions; (1) what factors lead to deforestation and degradation (environmental change) in the KNP? (2) How do these changes affect the environment, in terms of carbon stocks and biodiversity, and how have they been influenced by household decisions? (3) Lastly, how will household incomes and the environment in the park be influenced under different policy scenarios? The methodology will involve the use of mixed methods of data collection, and analysis. Questionnaires will be used to generate data on the socio-economic and demographic conditions of households while in-depth interviews with key informants will be used to generate data on land use trajectories, and household methods of adapting to the changing physical and socio-economic environment. Other techniques such as field based forest inventory, measures of carbon stocks, regression analysis, and other methods will be used. \r\n\r\nThis study provides the opportunity to examine the potential implications of PES/REDD policies on local households and communities, which is critical to our understanding of the important role households and local communities will have to play in global climate change mitigation strategies. The project will be conducted in association with The University of Buea, The Smithsonian Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS), and other local environmental NGOs interested in better understanding carbon stock dynamics and the prospects of implementing PES schemes. Furthermore, this project will allow the CoPI to gain valuable field research experience, while also completing his dissertation requirement. After the completion of the PhD, the CoPI will train students in field-based research methods in land change science. Results from this study will contribute to the increasing global talks regarding the importance of people, parks, and sustainable development in the tropics. The results will be shared with local affiliates, and also published in scientific papers as a contribution to the global debate on PES/REDD. User-friendly results will be disseminated to local communities, and copies of digitized maps will be given to chiefs and locals administrators of the park. The project also will provide support to enable a graduate student to establish an independent research career.",
