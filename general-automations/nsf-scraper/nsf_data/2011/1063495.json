A special committee will be appointed to conduct the workshop and workshop activities and the tasks include:\r\n1.\tIdentifying a range of critical goals for highly successful K-12 STEM education\r\n2.\tExploring the criteria for identifying schools and programs successful to those goals\r\n3.\tClassifying strategies and educational practices that schools and districts use to achieve success in STEM and identify scalable best practices associated with those strategies and practices\r\n\r\nBoth a letter report and a proceedings of the workshop will be developed.",
