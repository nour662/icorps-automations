 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will employ innovative processing technologies to incorporate highly crystalline ultra-long double wall carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) into poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) (Kevlar) to prepare advanced structural fibers for ballistic protection for our law enforcement and soldiers, and structural materials for commercial and military aircraft.  Current structural fibers are made from highly oriented, crystalline polymers or carbon. The polymer fibers are very tough, but their strength and stiffness is surpassed by carbon fibers, and each type has defined niche applications. The objective of this research is to utilize highly crystalline DWNT to combine these properties and prepare next-generation structural fibers with both high strength and toughness. This project addresses two of the most important deficiencies that have been limiting nanotube-polymer composites from approaching their theoretical properties: load transfer, by incorporating ultralong functionalized DWCNTs longer than the critical length in the target polymer, and nanotube alignment, by incorporating the nanotubes into the polymer prior to the highly orienting spinning process.  The anticipated result of this research is the development of structural fibers that exceed the toughness of present polymer fibers and the strength of carbon fibers.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, is the availability and mass production of ultra-high strength structural fibers with minimal cost increase over conventional fibers. This gives immediate impact in personal and vehicle ballistic protection affording mobility to personnel and vehicles; and in the commercial aerospace industry in which weight is becoming more of a premium as the cost and availability of fuel continues to impact this sector. The technology developed through this research will enhance scientific and technological understanding of how the physical and surface properties of carbon nanotubes affect the performance of polymers, not just for fibers but also in all-polymer composites. The Phase I team includes research institutions, manufacturers and end-users that are poised to take a successful program from the laboratory into production and commercialization.  If successful, the technology will substantially impact law enforcement and peacekeeping missions, affording personnel higher mobility and better protection in order to successfully execute their duties, while potentially saving many lives.  The commercial impact will be the use of this material for structural materials and armor, affording lighter weight, higher functionality aircraft and military vehicles, saving industry and the military money and materials.",

Structural fibers\nhave made inroads into industries that were once dominated by high strength metals, and fiber reinforced composites are currently used in structural applications where weight is a premium, such as space, aerospace, wind power, and ballistic applications for both personnel and vehicle protection. A breakthrough in fiber properties, especially strength, would result in a further revolution in structures and ballistic protection, civilian and military, by reducing platform weight by as much as 50%.\n\nBased on their superior mechanical properties, the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in fibers and composites has been explored since their discovery.  However, in order to fully reach the potential that nanotubes have for imparting high strength and stiffness into polymer fibers and composites, new innovations are required both in carbon nanotubes and in CNT/polymer blends. NTL ultralong DWNTs have the potential to make a significant\nimpact tin this area due to their extreme length, large aspect ratio, and high crystallinity.  In addition, their manufacturing process is amenable to direct scale-up with low labor requirements giving real commercial viability to the proposed fiber product.\n\nThrough our research, we found that the best nanotube containing fibers showed higher tensile modulus than the best control fibers, however, the tensile strength of the composite fibers was very similar to that of the control.  We are currently working on a new method of fiber preparation that we are confident will more conclusively answer this question.  \n\nIf this technology is successful, to the point where it can produce a viable product, the contributions to society would be immense. First and foremost, a higher performance ballistic fiber would be the result of this development.  Technically speaking, higher performance ballistic fiber refers to a lower weight and bulk for the same performance.  A technology such as this would contribute to protecting lives of law enforcement and military personnel; allowing them to perform missions wearing body armor that were impossible with lower performance material.  The savings goes beyond body armor as well, and includes protection of land, air, and sea vehicles, and the occupants therein; as well as the fabrication of fragment bags for storage and transport of IEDs and other types of explosives.\n\nThe second societal impact would be the benefit a fiber like this would have to the aerospace community.
