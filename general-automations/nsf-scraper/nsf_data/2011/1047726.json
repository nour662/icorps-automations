 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to observe two solar eclipses in 2012 that will occur over the USA and Australia. For the 20 May 2012 annular solar eclipse over the western USA, the PI plans to map long wavelength active-region radio emission at 91 centimeter and other wavelengths. For the 13 November 2012 total solar eclipse over Australia, he intends to make optical spectrographic observations of the white-light, green-line, and red-line corona and to work with highly processed images to bring out detail and contrast.  These processed images promise to improve measurements of the lifetimes and motions of coronal plumes and other coronal features. \r\n\r\nThe PI's solar corona observations will be applied to the study of other stars, many of whose coronae are currently being observed in x-rays by the Chandra satellite observatory. The PI notes that his high-resolution studies of flaring and active regions at long radio wavelengths should give information potentially useful for space weather predictions. The PI asserts that his expeditions to study the solar corona during eclipses have been a major part of the success of the Williams College Department of Astronomy in attracting and training undergraduate students in the physical sciences. The PI has widely disseminated his past research through technical journals, textbooks, National Geographic television programming, DVDs, and online streaming educational videos, and he will continue these efforts. Eclipses are of widespread public interest and provide unique opportunities for public education about astronomy and solar physics.",
