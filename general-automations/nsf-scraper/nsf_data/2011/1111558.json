 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Rodrigo Andrade of the Department of Chemistry at Temple University will apply novel synthetic methods toward the synthesis of various complex alkaloid natural products.  While many methods exist for the preparation of complex alkaloids, there is a need for step-efficient, asymmetric methodology.  Professor Andrade's research involves the discovery and development of novel methods to efficiently and selectively prepare complex natural products in an asymmetric manner, which is essential if they are to be employed as chemical probes in molecular biology.  Professor Andrade's group recently reported a sequential one-pot bis-cyclization method that has enabled the concise syntheses of several Strychnos alkaloids; this method will be employed in the syntheses of novel Strychnos and Aspidosperma alkaloids.  \r\n\r\nAlkaloids have a rich history in medicine, as many synthetic and semi-synthetic drugs such as Naloxone are structural modifications of alkaloids.  Therefore, more efficient synthetic approaches to this class of molecules will have significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry.   Some of the methodology developed in this proposal is also applicable to other classes of molecules.  Therefore, it will impact other areas of research (e.g., biochemical and agricultural sectors) in which the synthesis of these molecules is needed.    In terms of educational impacts, this project will provide excellent training of students, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.",

That the routes are asymmetric enables such an endeavor. A central objective of the proposed plan is the training of graduate students and undergraduates. These individuals represent the future of the scientific enterprise and as such, investment in the proper and effective training thereof is a top priority. The rigors of synthetic organic chemistry offer unparalleled training to the practitioner. Temple University boasts one of the most culturally diverse urban campuses in the United States; as such, it is an excellent source of underrepresented groups in the sciences. Finally, our findings will be presented at local and national conferences and meetings. The results are expected to impact those working in the fields of chemical and total synthesis, biochemistry and chemical biology.\n\n \n\nC.
