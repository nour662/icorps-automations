The center currently consists of the University of Virginia (lead), with the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, the Southern Methodist University, and the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign as research partners. \r\n\r\nThe University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and North Carolina State University (NCSU) present a synergistic effort that combines plasma chemistry, plasma-surface interactions, and plasma source development to enhance the scientific understanding of these systems, formulate pathways for industrial application that are founded in basic scientific understanding, and demonstrate the capabilities of intelligently designed next generation plasma devices to enable high technology precision manufacturing in the United States. This scientific effort is complimented by the broad and substantial outreach efforts of the investigators and their institutions. This integrated effort will compliment the current activities of the existing I/UCRC and broaden the scope of the center to include a class of plasma systems poised to make substantial contributions to future manufacturing efforts. \r\n\r\nThe addition of UTD and NCSU to the existing I/UCRC will fill a void in the capabilities of the U.S., providing a leadership role in the development of the fundamental science of low temperature plasmas. Related educational activities will include the traditional, and currently ongoing, outreach, educational, and scientific endeavors that engage students from high school to graduate level at both universities. Further, as both the Dallas and Raleigh-Durham areas have historically been regions in which low-temperature plasmas are widely used in industry, the consortium will be able to easily provide educational activities for working professions. These activities will be further enhanced by the presently established and successful outreach programs and distance education programs at both UTD and NCSU that will accelerate the accessibility of these programs to this broad industrial base.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe efforts under this grant have secured the necessary number of companies and financial committment from the private sector for NCSU to become a center site for the C-LPAM IUCRC based at the University of Virginia. Through support under this planning grant, NCSU has secured $150,000 in committed support for center efforts from Applied Materials Inc., Plasmatherm Inc., Advanced Energy Corporation, and MKS Instruments.\n\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed center work is substantial.  NCSU will advance the fundamental understanding of novel plasma heating mechanisms that will enable extension of nanoscale manufacturing to the sub 20nm regime.  New and hitherto unrealized applications outside of traditional electronics and material processing applications will also be advanced through efforts in understanding the mechanisms that drive atmospheric pressure discharges.\n\nThe broad impact of these center efforts is equally substantial.  NCSU will leverage the extensive office of outreach within the Department of Nuclear Engineering to develop dynamic engaging modules in plasma processing and plasma assisted manufacturing for K-12 students.  Additionally, NCSU will utilize the extensive distance education infrastructure through our Engineering Online office (engineeringonline.ncsu.edu) to produce engaging continuing education modules for mid-career engineers seeking to enhance their knowledge base in plasma science or move into plasma science from other professions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven C Shannon"
