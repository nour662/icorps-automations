 "awd_abstract_narration": "New Mexico State University, in collaboration with East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania, proposes a three-year program to increase the participation of individuals with mobility disabilities in computing. Persons with mobility disabilities are one of the largest groups of individuals with disabilities; however, they are not often targeted by educational programs because of the difficulty of accessing their community and the lack of academic role models to serve as advocates for them. The proposed project, ENABLE, is a comprehensive program that targets individuals with mobility disabilities who are in high school, post-high school, or early college years and have not yet chosen a career path. It will provide them with the knowledge, technology, and support they need to address the barriers to full participation in computing. ENABLE will run short workshops to expose participants to computing as an educational and career path, in order to demonstrate its feasibility and to motivate and excite the students. It  will also provide appropriate assistive technology to its participants, and it will support their success through mentoring and interaction with role models. In addition, the project will investigate various interactive video conferencing strategies for delivering its programs; this could lead to a model for institutions of higher education to use in more effectively serving this population. Partnerships with existing programs such as Reaching the Pinnacle and AccessComputing will serve to strengthen the quality of the ENABLE programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject ENABLE was a program aimed at motivating persons with physical disabilities to enter the field of computing.  The program attempted to change the perception of computer science within this population and to motivate the participants to obtain a degree in higher education or pursue a career in computing or a related field.  The program comprised three different workshops on computing: (1) Programming in Alice, (2) Robotics using LegoMinstorms and RobotC, and (3) Developing SmartPhone applications using AppInventor.  We also hosted Career and Technology speakers who spoke to participants about technology they were developing or researching, or their careers in a computing or computing-related field.   Additionally, we implemented a mentor program, where each participant had either a peer or professional mentor that interfaced with them on a weekly basis.  This project served a total of approximately 45 persons with disabilities over its three-year duration and participants were involved in program activities for one year.\n\n \n\nThe primary outcome of this program showed about a 10% increase in participants who were either enrolled or were planning to enroll in higher education as a result of their participation in the program.   9% of the participants stated that the program had made an impact on their choice to pursue a career in a computing-related area.  Note that the number of survey participants was small, so significance of these results in unclear.  Most participants strongly agreed that the material taught in the workshops was useful and enjoyable and did help them understand the field of computer science.  \n\n \n\nThroughout this program, much was learned about recruiting persons with disabilities for educational programs.  The fundamental numbers of persons in this population are small.  Therefore, recruitment was primarily done through rehabilitation centers who not only had current patients who were part of this population but also had contact with former patients through support groups and other community activities.  Many of our participants were former patients at these rehabilitation centers.  Very few participants were recruited from the local public schools.  We found that the number of students with physical disabilities is so small that recruitment efforts are too large for such a small benefit.  Additionally, reaching students in public schools is difficult due to privacy issues. \n\n \n\nIn summary, the program was beneficial and did show a positive impact.  There are many social issues that contribute to the low participation of persons with disabilities in higher education and in the broader workforce that should be investigated.   Although this program was challenging to implement due to the small numbers of this population group, it was well worth the effort and more work of this kind should be done to integrate persons with disabilities into our higher education system and into the workforce. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/15/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeanine M Cook"
