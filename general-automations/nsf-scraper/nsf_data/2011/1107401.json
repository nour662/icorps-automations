 "awd_abstract_narration": "Apex predators such as killer whales (Orcinus orca) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) directly compete with humans for ecosystem services such as fishery resources. One example of this type of competition is whale depredation on longline fisheries in Alaska. Sperm whale and killer whale depredation occurs when whales remove fish from longline gear, damage fish and/or fishing gear. This interaction has negative consequences for the longline fishery and for the whales. \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary dissertation project explores how whale depredation is impacting longline fishing practices and fishery resource use in Alaska. This research will synthesize social research interview and written questionnaire results with quantitative NMFS fishery data to construct a detailed economic analysis of the costs associated with depredation. Results from this study will establish baseline information on the socio-ecological and socio-economic impacts of cetacean depredation and how depredation impacts the long-term sustainability of longline fisheries in Alaska.",
