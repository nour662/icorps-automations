This summer school will bring\r\nthirty graduate students and early-career mathematicians together\r\nfor an introduction to an area in topology which is ripe for\r\ninvestigation, and whose techniques will inform and inspire\r\ndevelopments throughout topology. This summer school will use a\r\nunique blend of pedagogical tools, combining elements which have\r\nbeen successful in other settings. Younger researchers will be\r\ninvolved with both organizing and giving talks. Attendees will be\r\nencouraged to work problems, fill in background, and do reading\r\ntogether in addition to attending lectures.\r\n\r\nThe West Coast Topology Summer School continues a series that\r\nbegan in summer 2010 and will strengthen the knowledge base of\r\ntopologists and others who use topology and build a cohort of\r\njunior researchers familiar with recent developments in the\r\nsubject. The program organizers of the Summer School are the\r\nprincipal investigators, together with Alejandro Adem of the\r\nUniversity of British Columbia and the Pacific Institute of\r\nMathematical Sciences (PIMS). PIMS is a partner in the project,\r\nwhich will bring together US--based graduate students, largely\r\nfrom the western United States, and Canadian graduate students\r\nsponsored by PIMS. In its role as a basic study of shape,\r\ntopology has significant ramifications in other areas of\r\nmathematics, from basic counting problems (combinatorics) to\r\nsolutions of equations (algebra) to applications and extensions\r\nof the calculus (analysis). More broadly, knowledge of topology\r\nis essential for example in studying the structure of the early\r\nuniverse, in designing a robot arm with a minimal number of\r\ncontrollers, and in searching large data sets for meaningful\r\ngroupings as successfully done recently for study of breast\r\ncancer. This summer school will strengthen the ties between basic\r\nareas of theoretical mathematics. Mathematicians from\r\nunderrepresented backgrounds will be vigorously recruited.\r\nGraduate students and post-docs will gain hands-on experience\r\nwith some of the most important developments of contemporary\r\nmathematics, preparing them to be future leaders of the field.\r\nParticipants will enlarge their professional networks, which is\r\nespecially critical given the geographical distances faced by\r\nmathematicians in the western half of North America. Organizers\r\nand participants will also have the opportunity to reflect upon\r\nthe array of pedagogical tools employed, and might employ some\r\nthemselves in training graduate students and undergraduates or\r\nreaching out to fellow scientists and the general public.",
