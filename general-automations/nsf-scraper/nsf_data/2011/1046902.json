 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a wireless, needle implantable miniaturized (0.5 x 0.5 x 5 mm) sensor for continuous glucose monitoring, with provisions for internal self-calibration without the need for frequent, external fingerpricking. The proposed internal self-calibration is enabled through the use of novel pulse-mode sensor operation which quantifies sensitivity drifts internally. Pulsed-mode operation also results in improved power management as well as long sensor lifetime. Biocompatible coatings release various tissue response modifiers to control tissue inflammation. The device can be inserted under the skin and similarly removed via a needle, thus avoiding surgical implantation/removal. Phase-I seeks to develop the internal self-calibration routines and demonstrate proof-of-concept ex vivo. Phase II will focus on extensive in vivo studies thereby facilitating commercialization.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are enormous considering that there is an urgent need for continuous glucose monitoring devices in view of the growing number of diabetics. Implantable glucose sensors that afford minimal user intervention present a viable alternative, although their \"user-independent\" nature is often undermined by necessity for frequent external calibration by finger-pricking. The proposed project will result in a truly \"user-independent\" operation of implantable glucose sensors. In addition, the proposed internal calibration methodology is universal to all biosensors used for metabolic monitoring, rendering competitive market edge and job creation. The project will be performed in the Technology Incubation Program (TIP), at University of Connecticut. This industrial/academic collaboration provides training for the graduate and undergraduate students in the field ofbiosensors.",

The device can be inserted under the skin and similarly removed via a needle, thus avoiding surgical implantation/removal and also affords wireless operation.  The localized release of various tissue response modifiers has afforded effective inflammation/fibrosis suppression, and neo-angiogenesis.  This has eliminated the major 1-10 days sensor failure processes, and allowed prolonged sensor operation.  However, during long-term operation, sensor sensitivity gradually drifts contributing to inaccuracies in the measured glucose levels. \n\nThe Phase I NSF/SBIR project entitled \"Self Calibrating, Wireless, Needle Implantable Sensor for Continuous Glucose Monitoring\" aimed to develop a continuous glucose monitoring sensor with provisions for an internal calibration routine that accounts for a number of long-term sensory drifts and permits self-calibration.  Phase-I developed an internal calibration routine and demonstrate proof-of-concept in an ex vivo environment (serum model).  The proposed Phase II is intended to extend the developed concept in an in vivo environment as well development the proximity communicator and associated electronics. \n\nThe Phase-I of the NSF-SBIR has been successfully accomplished and the scientific accomplishments as well as the expertise gained will aid in a timely of the Phase-II project.  The Phase-I has resulted in 4 publications (2 accepted, 1 submitted and 1 under preparation) and 6 conference presentation, which are presented below. \n\nPublications:\n\nL. Qiang, S. Vaddiraju, D.
