Such mechanisms that integrate sets of correlated traits can potentially constrain further evolution of traits, limiting changes that can occur. The project will detail how sets of correlated traits may be \"pulled apart\" by analyzing physiological mechanisms underlying suites of correlated characters. The project will study twelve closely related species in a genus of lizards in which there are repeated origins of a specific novel trait. The project will study physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying the coevolution of visual and chemical communication, assessing traits involved in signal production and signal reception. The PIs will also develop statistical methods needed to analyze data on correlated traits when the study species are closely related. The resulting software enabling such statistical analyses will be made freely available online for use by other researchers. There are diverse broader impacts. First, undergraduate and graduate student will be trained and they will collaborate with researchers in biochemistry, molecular biology, neurophysiology, animal behavior, evolutionary biology, and biostatistics. Second, the funding will enhance infrastructure for research and education by establishing collaborations between researchers in different disciplines and institutions within the US, and also in Mexico where many of the study species occur. Finally, the PIs will enhance scientific and technological understanding by the public by 1) collaborating with two Indiana science museums to establish displays based on the funded research; 2) making data available by means of an existing online database service (Ethosource); and 3) connecting research outcomes with ongoing outreach activities that the PIs have established with local K-12 science teachers to assist in developing teaching units related to the science topics involved in the project.",
