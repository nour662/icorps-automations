 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to elucidate materials factors that control the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the equiatomic compound FeNi with the chemically-ordered tetragonal L10 structure that holds very high potential for rare-earth-free advanced permanent magnet applications.  Fundamental exploratory research on magnetic alloys in the near-equiatomic compositional region of the Fe-Ni phase diagram will take place in materials with and without the ternary alloying additions of Ti, V, and Al.  These materials will be synthesized in both bulk and thick-film form, with insight gained from film analogs of the focus alloys used to guide rational design of bulk alloys.  Correlations between chemical ordering and magnetic properties such as magnetization, anisotropy and Curie temperature will be determined and quantified to facilitate trend prediction.\r\n\r\nAstronomers have identified the L10 FeNi phase in selected meteorites and attributed its presence to an extraordinarily slow cooling rate that fosters long-range chemical ordering over a period of 4.6 billion years.  Confirmation of the L10 structure in the Fe-Ni system is extremely significant because the tetragonal distortion that accompanies the chemical ordering in this structure gives rise to appreciable anisotropy.  The development of rare-earth-free permanent magnet materials is essential to offset supply limitations and ensure U.S. competitiveness.  Attainment of a rare-earth-free magnetic material with very high magnetocrystalline anisotropy would carry tremendous impact that ranges from the basic science realm all the way to advanced applications of great societal importance.  Students supported by this grant will obtain an interdisciplinary research experience via educational exchange at three geographically diverse, strong science and engineering schools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany technologies rely on super-strong permanent magnets, including cell phones, computers, and medical instrumentation.  Further, high-efficient and powerful electric motors and generators critical for electric and hybrid vehicles and machines important to countless industries can be advanced only by the discovery and production of new magnetic materials.  Currently, all of the strongest permanent magnets contain rare earth elements&mdash;elements that have supply chain issues since the raw materials are mined overseas.  Thus, there is a strong incentive to develop new materials with outstanding magnetic performance.  An equiatomic compound between iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni) has the potential to impact the permanent magnet community due to its intrinsic characteristics.  However, this compound, known as tetrataenite, has been mostly observed only in meteorites that have undergone extremely slow cooling (less than one degree every million years).  This project sought to better understand the phase transformation necessary to form FeNi (tetrataenite), and to induce atomic-level defects that would promote atomic migration and thus the formation of the desired structure. Different alloys were processed by various non-equilibrium techniques, and the defect formation quantified and analyzed. Through the course of the work, knowledge was gained on the crystallization process induced by high-energy deformation, defect generation and dynamic annihilation during high-energy deformation, and the various crystallization pathways available via non-equilibrium processing.  Ultimately, the desired phase, tetrataenite, proved to be difficult to form, though one processing route, known as gas condensation, displayed hints of the desired phase formation.  Broader impacts included the training of a doctoral student, currently employed in U.S. industry.  Also, several archival papers were published containing the scientific results, and the work was presented at several international conferences.  Undergraduate researchers were also involved with the project, learning the fundamentals of research.  Finally, a high school science teacher conducted some of the research as well during the summer.  We have found that providing research experience for undergraduates encourages students to pursue graduate degrees, and teachers involved in the research endeavor are able to better communicate fundamental science to their high school students by connecting science basics to applications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/14/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey E Shield"
