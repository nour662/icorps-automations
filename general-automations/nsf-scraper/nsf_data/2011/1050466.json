 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will investigate geometric invariants which associate automorphic forms to structured manifolds.  The homotopy theoretic construction of these invariants is related to properties of holomorphic Eisenstein series on unitary groups.  A geometric construction of these invariants will also be pursued, using higher dimensional field theories.  These geometric invariants, when regarded as invariants of framed manifolds, give rise to invariants of elements of the stable homotopy groups of spheres.  The arithmetic properties of such families of automorphic forms arising from periodic families in the stable homotopy groups of spheres will also be investigated. Similar analysis for unstable homotopy groups of spheres will be considered using Goodwillie calculus.  The PI also proposes an educational program to identify and develop diverse undergraduate talent at MIT through ROUTE partnerships (Reading Outreach for Undergraduate Talent Exploration).  These partnerships will pair MIT undergraduates who are interested in the mathematics major, but may not know what mathematicians do, with graduate student mentors to engage in semester long directed reading projects. These mentoring partnerships will be targeted to undergraduates who are members of underrepresented minority groups.  The PI will solicit undergraduate research projects from outstanding students completing the ROUTE program, some of which will advance his own research agenda.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will advance our current understanding of geometry.  It will also link this new understanding to physics, as the proposed research involves generalizations of string theory.  As the proposed research involves using number theory to study geometry, it will associate new arithmetic structures to known geometric structures.  The ROUTE partnerships will create a pathway to tap the diverse talent pool represented by the MIT undergraduate population, and will attract a more diverse collection of individuals to pursue the mathematics major.",
