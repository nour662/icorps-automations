The activities of the project will be supported by an enhanced STEM infrastructure at LSCC impacting the underrepresented populations in STEM careers especially in the Central Alabama region.   The overarching goal of the 2-Pi-STEM Project is to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the STEM career paths focusing in the following goals: (1) Provide cross curricular mentoring and learning communities for STEM students to improve persistence and efficacy in STEM courses (2) Create a STEM pipeline by providing enrichment and academic enhancement programs for high school students (3) Implement a college bridge program for incoming freshman/sophomore and transfer students in concert with LSCC's Freshman Academy, a seminar class acclimating new students to college life. The project expects to increase preparation and success of a pool of African American students in Central Alabama in transitioning from high school, being retained in STEM at the community college, and transferring in STEM to a four-year college.",

For example: A research methods course titled STEM Research Methods (MTH 252). The course provides opportunity for the student to study selected topics in research and leadership under the supervision. The course covers quantitative and qualitative methodologies and leadership theory for credit. Students are introduced to basic research methodologies and leadership theories.

Earl defines it as proactive interactions with students, with the intention of connecting with them before a situation occurs that cannot be fixed (1988). If you believe that intrusive Advising is &ldquo;hand-holding&rdquo; or parenting, it is not, according to Upcraft &amp; Kramer, but rather it is active concern for students&rsquo; academic preparation; it is a willingness to assist students in exploring services and programs to improve skills and increase academic motivation (1995).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The framework of the conceptual model included advising and mentorship, research, recruitment, and enrichment, these components radiate into projects and activities: learning communities, research experiences for undergraduates, summer enrichment institute, and College Bridge opportunities.

Intrusive (Proactive or Intentional) advising: (mentoring; enrichment; academic enhancement, accountability, and advising; social, and economic resources, academic monitoring; progress reports; study plans; time management; social enhancement (social accountability).
