The conference will take\r\nat California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA on September 19, 2011. The conference website is http://dna17.caltech.edu. The goals of the event are to elucidate future directions and specific challenges for the field of DNA computation and molecular programming, and to facilitate discussion on how these visions are to be met. The DNA17 conference is the flagship conference in this emerging area. \r\n\r\nA report will be provided to NSF after the event, consisting of a short statement from each invited panelist and a summary of each panel discussion by the organizers. The panel discussions will provide a timely assessment of the field and the challenges and opportunities for the future, which will be useful to conference attendees and other researchers working in this area as they formulate their next research directions. \r\n\r\nRequested funds will primarily go to support registration and travel expenses for the invited panelists, \r\nas well as incidental costs associated with the impromptu parallel sessions.",
