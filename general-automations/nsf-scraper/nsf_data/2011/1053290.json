 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will result in the digitization of 150,000 specimens of dried specimens of algae, bryophytes, fungi (including lichens) and vascular plants from the Caribbean region held by The William and Lynda Steere Herbarium of The New York Botanical Garden, completing the digitization of the entire holdings of 300,000 specimens from the region.  Herbarium specimens are the fundamental source of information on the earth?s vegetation, past and present, and there is no larger single source of such information for the Caribbean region than the Steere Herbarium.  The Caribbean region contains many unique habitats and species, and these habitats are critically endangered. The data provided by this project will be essential to documenting the plants and fungi of the region. \r\n\r\nThis project can aid conservation efforts by indicating areas of diversity for protection, supplementing the distributional profile of individual species in order to document their conservation status, and tracking the spread of invasive species. The countries of the region can use these data to serve as the nucleus of new projects that will provide training and employment for regional biologists.  Whenever possible, the project will seek to hire staff from the local community surrounding the New York Botanical Garden, which contains a preponderance of immigrants from the Caribbean region, a group under-represented in Science. The data provided by this project will also serve Homeland Security by helping U.S. Fish and Wildlife staff to identify quarantined plant material.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Caribbean islands contain many unique habitats and species, many of which are critically endangered.  The goal of this project is to complete the digitization of Caribbean specimens held by The William and Lynda Steere Herbarium of The New York Botanical Garden, which holds the world\u00c6s largest collection of plant and fungal specimens from this region.  The data set, now almost complete, contains more than 400,000 specimens that are available for searching and download through The Garden\u00c6s Virtual Herbarium.  An example of the use of this data set is the Garden\u00c6s Caribbean Plants at Risk program.  The objective of the program  is to make a rapid assessment of habitat-restricted plant species that are most at risk for extirpation should those habitats be eliminated by human development or environmental change.  Herbarium specimens provide critical historical and modern locality information allowing us to map plant species distributions.  If species distributions are limited and/or collection data are only historical, those particular species are designated a higher conservation priority.\n\nThrough the Caribbean digitization project, we  digitized 191,000 specimens.  These are available now for searching through the Garden's Virtual Herbarium (http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/VirtualHerbarium.asp) developed a novel workflow for specimen digitization that involves deconstructing the very time-consuming data transcription from specimen labels into discrete tasks that can be at least partially automated.
