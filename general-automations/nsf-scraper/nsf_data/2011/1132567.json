 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oceanic copepods in the family Calanidae, such as Calanus finmarchicus, are among the most abundant animals on the planet, and they serve a key role in marine food webs by transferring energy from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels. The life history of these copepods has been well-studied, but fundamental questions remain about the regulation of an important period of dormancy called diapause.  In the last juvenile stage of development, C. finmarchicus either proceed to the terminal molt (i.e., molt into adults) or vertically migrate to depth and initiate diapause. This divergence in developmental pathways has critical implications for C. finmarchicus population dynamics, but is difficult to study experimentally because C. finmarchicus, like all other copepods in the family Calanidae, do not reliably enter diapause in the laboratory. In addition, most temperate populations of calanoid copepods have multiple generations in a single year with variability in the timing of reproduction and development that causes significant heterogeneity in age structure. Thus, field sampling of these heterogeneous populations yields a mixture of copepods that are preparing for diapause, are preparing for the terminal molt, or are not yet preparing for either fate. Studies of diapause preparation in such populations are extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nTo enable direct investigation of the factors that influence diapause initiation, we require markers that reliably predict the fate of individual copepods (entry into diapause or continued maturation to adulthood) within heterogeneous populations. Fortunately, the fjord population of C. finmarchicus off the coast of Norway during the late spring is remarkably synchronous and is comprised of juvenile copepods that are all destined to undergo diapause.  This project will use high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing to identify genes that change in expression as these copepods progress toward diapause. In collaboration with Norwegian researchers, the investigators will also rear copepods in a unique continuous culture and conduct additional transcriptional profiling to identify genes that change in expression as copepods prepare for the terminal molt. Comparison of gene expression patterns in the wild and cultured populations will enable the principal investigators to develop robust markers of diapauses preparation that can be used to study diapause initiation in more heterogeneous temperate populations.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Despite decades of research, we are still ignorant of the processes that trigger diapause and are therefore unable to model the population dynamics of calanoid copepods for even a single generation. This is a long-standing and well-known gap in our understanding of marine ecosystems, and progress on this research problem could be transformative. By developing molecular markers to identify preparation for diapause, the investigators seek to enable novel physiological and ecological research that will ultimately identify both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that control entry into diapause. Their approach is based on an assumption that gene expression patterns in wild populations are sufficiently consistent to be used as a reliable indicator of diapause preparation. This fundamental assumption has yet to be tested; thus, this work is risky but with potentially high reward and suitable for an EAGER project. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will enable a highly complementary new collaboration between US and Norwegian researchers and the training of undergraduate and graduate students. The results will be communicated to broad audiences through social media. Development and application of biomarkers of diapause preparation will ultimately allow modelers to parameterize diapause and improve the ability of ecosystem models to forecast changes associated with human impacts to oceans and climate change",

Just before reaching adulthood, many of these tiny marine crustaceans enter a type of hibernation called diapause to avoid adverse conditions in the upper ocean (e.g., warm temperatures, low food concentration, abundant predators).  They migrate to depth and remain in diapause for months until conditions improve for them to migrate back to the surface, molt into adults, and begin reproducing.  Curiously, some copepods skip diapause and molt directly into adults.  The circumstances under which some copepods enter diapause and others skip diapause are very poorly known.  As a result of this knowledge gap, predicting how populations of copepods change from year to year is impossible, and we therefore have limited ability to predict how changes in the environment from year to year will affect commercially important fish stocks and endangered baleen whales.  Moreover, we are completely unable to predict how temperate, subarctic, and arctic ecosystems will be altered by climate change without a better understanding of the factors that trigger diapause.\n\nOur research was aimed at developing both (1) an understanding of the physiological processes that occur during preparation for diapause and during preparation for molting into the adult stage (i.e., skipping diapause), and (2) practical biomarkers that faithfully predict on which developmental path (preparing to diapause or to skip diapause) a copepod may be.  We did this by examining two populations of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, the dominant calanoid copepod in the North Atlantic Ocean, during laboratory and field research in Trondheim, Norway: a lab-reared population that skips diapause and a fjord population that enters diapause.  By comparing gene expression between these two populations using state-of-the-art techniques (Illumina and qPCR), we were able to identify genes that \"turn on\" along each of these two developmental pathways.  In particular, copepods that skip diapause show increased expression of genes associated with fat (lipid) accumulation (ELOV, FABP) early in the last stage of development before adulthood, and then expression of these genes reduces as they get closer to molting into an adult.  Genes likely associated with molting (e.g., TORSO-like) show very high expression late in the last stage of development in preparation for the terminal molt, and therefore serve as excellent biomarkers of copepods that are skipping diapause.\n\nIn contrast, wild copepods that are preparing for diapause show continued high expression of genes associated with lipid accumulation, which is essential for surviving the long periods of starvation associated with diapause.  We identified several candidate genes and gene families that are expressed at much higher levels in the wild copepods than in the lab-reared copepods, and that also have roles in diapause in other crustaceans and insects.  Future work will focus on confirming that these genes are consistently and specifically associated with diapause preparation in Calanus finmarchicus.  Ultimately, these genes can be used to initiate novel studies about both the physiological and environmental factors that affect a copepod\u00c6s \"decision\" to enter diapause.  With this information, we will be able to better predict the fate of both copepod populations and the ecosystems in which they serve such vital roles.\n\nThroughout the project, we have taken the opportunity to train students at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  In particular, a PhD student in the MIT/WHOI Joint program, Ms. Amalia Aruda Almada, came with us to Trondheim to study bacterial interactions with wild Calanus finmarchicus caught in Trondheimsfjord.
