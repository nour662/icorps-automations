 "awd_abstract_narration": "The DIG-Maps project is increasing the number of minority students pursuing undergraduate degrees in geoscience by leveraging a strong existing partnership between North Carolina State University and Wake Tech Community College, both located in Raleigh, NC.  Collaboration between faculty from NC State's Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and Wake Tech's Geology faculty is developing enhanced introductory geology courses, summer and regular term research opportunities for undergraduate students, career and academic advising, and creating a learning community for program participants from Wake Tech, who will be able to continue their education at NC State. A distance education lecture and laboratory course that incorporates research-based pedagogy and field components is extending opportunities to those unable to attend regular classes.  Outreach to high schools through The Science House and a summer camp are being used to attract high school students to the program. Evaluation results are being used to establish the project as a model for collaboration between research universities and area community colleges.  As an additional broader impact, the large number of participants taking the introductory geoscience course at Wake Tech are gaining valuable knowledge about Earth Systems that will make them better prepared citizens.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of this project was to attract more students, particularly non-traditional students and students from under-represented groups to geoscience majors.  The major component of the program was recruitment of students from introductory geology courses at Wake Technical Community College for summer research opportunities at North Carolina State University.  The introductory courses emphasized career opportunities and examples of the type of work geologists do to demonstrate the relevance of geoscience to society..  The summer research experiences, mentored by faculty of the Department of Marine Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (MEAS)  at NC State, involved projects specifically designed to allow students with limited geology backgrounds to undertake research projects, not simply participate in projects run by others.  The research usually had a direct societal and/or environmental implication.\n\nStudents in introductory geology typically take the course as a general education course and do not plan to major in geology. This project resulted in a tremendous increase in interest in the number of students choosing to major in geology each year.  Over 70 students participated in the summer research program during the life of the project, about 90% expressed an intention in majoring in geology.  Many transferred to NC State and pursued their degree there.  Prior to the project,  an average of less than one student from Wake Tech tranferred to MEAS each year.  \n\nThe unusual aspect of the program was the selection of students for research from a community college, who had only one or two introductory geology courses and typically, did not intend to become geologists.  Recruiting students from introductory courses thus allowed us to reach students who otherwise would be unlikely to choose a geoscience major.\n\nThe students participating in summer research received training in research methods and in presentation of abstracts and posters for a professional presentation.  They then presented their work at a university research symposium.  The success of the many research projects and the quality of the student's presentation proved that these students were capable of  undertaking research. The enthusiasm of the student's for majoring in geology proved that the approach was successful in attracting students to the science.\n\nThe project also included operating a one-week summer camp for rising high school seniors.  The objective of the camp was to provide students with examples of research from each of the three disciplines in MEAS, geology, marine science and meteorology.  Instructors for the camp each year included representitives from each of the disciplines.  The camp was designed to show the relevance and excitement of research in each area.  The students selected for the camp had indicated interest in science; their interest in geoscience in particular was always increased by camp participation.\n\nThe results of both the summer research experiences for community college students and the summer science camp for high school students were so impressive that both activities are being continued under new, totally separate programs funded by the National Science Foundation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John C Fountain"
