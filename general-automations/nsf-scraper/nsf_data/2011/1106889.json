Mosquitofish are especially useful for studying the impacts of endocrine disrupting compounds because male and female mosquitofish have different physical characteristics. The anal fin of males is longer than the females, and anal fins grow on females when they are exposed to androgens (the male sex steroid). Another reason that studying mosquitofish is important is the fact that female mosquitofish with male-like anal fins were found downstream of paper mills in Florida over 30 years ago and are still found at one impacted site. The main issue with using mosquitofish for evaluating the impacts of chemicals in field studies is that we do not have a strong understanding of how anal fin growth occurs, both in normal males and in females exposed to androgens. This type of information is crucial for accurately interpreting results from the field and extrapolating results to predicted effects on other endpoints such as reproductive fitness. One way that we can obtain this information is to determine what genes are expressed in the growing anal fin during androgen treatment.
