 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concrete gravity dams are critical infrastructure serving electricity generation, water supply, flood control, irrigation and recreation. Large concrete dams would most likely experience different earthquake induced motions at different points on their base during an earthquake. This spatial variation of the motions is commonly ignored in the seismic design of these massive structures, although it may induce more severe response patterns in the structures, which may potentially pave the way for the loss of the reservoir and ensuing devastation. This project will comprehensively study the effect of the spatial variability of the ground motions on a few carefully selected concrete gravity dams from the nation?s inventory exposed to seismic excitations pertinent to their sites. The study will involve detailed numerical modeling and dynamic analysis of dam systems to accurately include the complex nonlinear material behavior and interactions of the dam concrete, foundation rock and water in the reservoir. The project will provide the methodology and framework for the evaluation of the effect of spatially variable ground motions on the response of concrete gravity dams. Based on the research results, recommendations for incorporating the effect of spatial variability of seismic motions in the design and retrofit of dam structures will be made.\r\n\r\nThe research results will enable engineers to design safer concrete gravity dams and to evaluate the performance of existing dams to identify those posing significant hazard to the community in terms of expected casualties and economic losses. The outcomes of the study will be directly disseminated to the profession via publications and presentations. The numerical codes and data generated with this project will be posted on a web site for use by researchers and practicing engineers. This will eventually enhance the safety of the nation?s vital infrastructure. The research will also provide advanced training to graduate and undergraduate students. Underrepresented groups will be recruited in the project using well established institutional partnerships.",

This study undertook the evaluation of the seismic response of these massive structures using numerical modeling. There are a number of issues when the physical domain (structure and supporting rock) is discretized into the numerical domain. One issue is that, in reality, the seismic waves propagate from the source to the site, excite the structure, and then propagate back into the earth, disappearing into its vast domain. A numerical model, however, cannot reproduce the vast earth domain. Hence, one needs to impose boundaries over a limited (finite) earth domain that are capable of fully absorbing the waves that propagate away from the structure. A novel approach has been developed that fully absorbs these outgoing waves and can be used in conjunction with numerical codes. Another issue is that seismic motions are recorded on the ground surface, but, in a numerical model, they need to be applied at depth, at the location where the finite numerical domain connects with the vast earth domain, where the waves disappear. Another novel approach was developed to evaluate seismic motions at the appropriate depth, given the surface motions and the characteristics of the soil strata underneath the structure. Furthermore, guidelines by the US Army Corps of Engineers, to facilitate ease in the numerical evaluation of these massive structures, suggest that the foundation area can be modeled without consideration of its mass. This, however, assumes that the foundation mass plays no role in the response of the structure, whose mass is still taken into account. The evaluation performed under this project indicated that the recommendations of the US Corps of Engineers are extremely conservative for the dam response and depend, to a large degree, on the characteristics of the seismic excitation. With the two novel approaches developed in this project, as noted above, the overly-conservative simplifications of the US Army Corps of Engineers are no longer needed, and dam performance can be safely evaluated using realistic modeling. Dams, as any other structure that extends for long distances parallel to the ground are subjected to the effect of spatially variable ground motions, i.e. motions that are functions of time but vary with space due to the propagation of the waves.
