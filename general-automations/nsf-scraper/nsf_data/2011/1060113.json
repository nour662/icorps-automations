 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is implementing an S-STEM project that builds a direct bridge to the Ph.D. for outstanding undergraduate engineering and computer science students.  The objectives of the project are to (a) increase the number of senior engineering and computer science students, in particular those of Hispanic background, who are encouraged to pursue a doctoral degree at UTEP; (b) to provide advising and mentoring opportunities that will enable S-STEM scholars to transition smoothly into Ph.D. programs; (c) to offer a professional development of S-STEM scholars that will help provide the tools necessary for a successful doctoral career; and (d) to systematically track progress made by S-STEM scholars toward degree completion.  To address the project goals and objectives of the project, UTEP is utilizing a very experienced team of administrators, faculty, and professional staff who are in charge of integrating advising, mentoring, and professional development in a way that allows students and faculty to work toward a productive doctoral experience within a well defined timeline for degree completion. The project has the potential for locally broadening STEM participation by directly increasing the number of advanced degrees awarded to Hispanics in a relatively short period of time. Furthermore, this mentoring model is replicable and has the potential for a broadening impact in the way many other institutions approach issues of recruiting, retention and graduation at the graduate level in STEM disciplines.",
