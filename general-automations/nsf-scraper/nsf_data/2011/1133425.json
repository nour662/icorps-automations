 "awd_abstract_narration": "1133425\r\nGaustad\r\nLittle work in nanotechnology environment, health and safety implications is directed toward complex nanomaterials and their life cycles.  Fundamental studies currently have mainly examined simple, homogeneous materials comprised of a single metal, metal oxide, or a simple organic moiety.  Nanomaterials in commerce have moved well beyond these simple, ?first generation? materials.  This research is directed toward examining impacts of high volume nanomaterials in commerce, specifically LiFePO4 and LiMnO4 in lithium-ion batteries throughout their life cycle with a particular focus on end of life and the potential for exposure.  The investigators will optimize recycling and reuse procedures for nano lithium batteries while simultaneously assessing environmental discharges of particles (during recycling processing) and leachates from modeled landfills using a standard Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) procedure.\r\n\r\nTo date there has been no work that explicitly addresses the environmental implications of nano-scale materials in batteries, despite recognition of considerable environmental uncertainties and concern at end-of life.  This research will provide results and methodological guidance for quantifying environmental risks at end-of-life for two commonly used nano-scale cathode chemistry batteries. The investigation will advance the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) body of knowledge related to the use of lithium ion batteries by creating new Life Cycle Impact data, quantifying potential end of life battery risks, developing knowledge on novel recycling techniques, and identifying best practices for ensuring environmental health and safety goals for nano-scale cathode materials.\r\n\r\nThe research team is well-suited to address the problem from both a life cycle approach and a materials science/analytical approach.  They include a materials engineer, an environmental engineer and a chemist, with expertise in the chemistry of lithium ion batteries, life cycle assessment,  nanomaterials, and recycling.\r\n\r\nThe project has an inherent broader impact on society as a whole, as it should lead directly to improved recycling and synthesis methods for nanoparticles in lithium ion batteries. It is clear that the existing industry partners of the research team will benefit from the research and this will lead to improved, \"greener\" production and disposal methods. Also, the investigators are associated with a sustainability institute at RIT, and this institute seems to have very strong programs in outreach and education. There are clear plans and procedures to increase participation by underrepresented groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\n            This project was able to contribute to the advancement of lithium ion batteries, particularly those containing nanomaterials by 1) quantifying some of the economic and environmental tradeoffs of a transition to next generation cathode and anode chemistries, 2) providing an initial characterization of the potential for exposure during recycling processes, and 3) developing novel recycling routes for end-of-life lithium ion batteries enhanced with nanomaterials. \n\n            This project found that as chemistries transition from Li-Co based cathodes to Li based Fe, Mn, and S cathodes, lithium ion battery recovery value will decrease as it correlates to the value of these raw materials; this indicates regulation will need to play a significant role in incentivizing recovery as profit-based recycling will not be a viable option. \n\n            A large intellectual contribution of this project is development of recycling routes for lithium ion batteries with a focus on nano-materials.  Specifically, this work found that basic acid and thermal treatments could successfully return single wall carbon nanotubes, recovered from lithium ion battery electrodes, to their pre-cycling functionality, using half the energy of traditional synthesis.  We were also able to isolate LiFePO4 cathode material post-cycling and refunctionalize the material to regain its original electrochemical performance, again, using less energy and chemicals than traditional synthesis.  Size segregation was also shown to be a viable method of concentrating the valuable metals in lithium ion batteries; a route with high potential for scale-up, lowering costs, and being automated.\n\nWhen refunctionalization of cathode and anode materials is not possible, likely recycling routes will involve shredding and potentially sorting of battery materials.  This research work investigated whether exposure to nanomaterials may be a possibility during recycling processes for lithium ion batteries.  Presence, size, concentration, and composition of nano-particles were determined using electron microscopy, x-ray fluoresce, and spectroscopy. Results indicate the potential for release and exposure during these recycling activities with varying degree; most sorting equipment results in more release than shredding activities.  This initial work fills life cycle inventory data gaps for airborne nanoparticle emission that would affect both human and health and safety impact assessment as well as ecotoxicity.\n\nIn the pursuit of quantifying these risks, our research group found that many studies have been done to understand the ecotoxicological impacts of nanomaterials; however, comparing results between these studies is difficult as methodologies range greatly between disciplines.  There is a clear need to synthesize the work between the engineering, environmental health and safety, medical, and ecology communities. One key result of this project was to outline methodologies from impact and exposure literature in a range of disciplines and provide an initial assessment of key gap areas within the life-cycle of several case study products.  Integrated metrics are explored in this context.   Implementation of risk-reducing strategies (regulations, product design, etc.)  was discussed in the framework of a life-cycle perspective to identify which may have the highest potential impact within that stage.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nFive PhD, two MS, and two high schools students received stipend support, training, mentorship, and professional development opportunities via this project.  Their efforts resulted in strong student led dissemination including thirteen presentations at conferences, five peer-reviewed papers in high impact journals, and two PhD dissertations.  The PIs also organized a variety of broader outreach including exhibits at Imagine RIT, an event drawing 35,000 visitors to RIT and summer camp outreach activities targeting 4th-6th grade girls to encou..."
