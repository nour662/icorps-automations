 "awd_abstract_narration": "Selectivity in catalysis requires the use of materials with well-defined active sites. Those sites also need to be robust, to survive all of the conditions used for their preparation and activation and for the process of catalysis. The manufacturing of such materials with well-defined active sites has been difficult to achieve in the past, but has recently received some help from the field of nanotechnology. Professor Francisco Zaera of the University of California at Riverside believes preparation of catalyst sites with extreme specificity in physicochemistry is now possible, and the results will be extremely useful. New colloidal and other self-assembly synthetic methodologies can now be used to make nanoparticles with specific sizes and shapes. This proposal describes research to develop general synthetic approaches for the preparation of metal-based catalysts with well-defined structural and/or chemical characteristics. Two interconnected directions of research are proposed: (1) the use of nanoparticles of Pt, Ni, and Pd will be made with exclusive (111) or (100) facets exposed with narrow distributions of sizes and well-defined shapes for the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts; and (2) the encapsulation of those metal nanoparticles by several approaches as a way to increase their stability and isolate their functionality. Desirable catalytic behavior will be targeted in terms of selectivity and/or stability, in particular for mild reactions involving hydrocarbon conversions such as hydrogenations and isomerizations in olefins and other unsaturated molecules. \r\n\r\nThe aim is to combine the use of novel synthetic methods with the understanding achieved from studies using model systems to design selective and robust metal catalysts for mild catalytic processes. The value of this approach is that it combines knowledge developed by three separate communities: self-assembly chemists, catalyst developers, and surface scientists. Success will have  repercussions on the design of new industrial\r\nprocesses that rely on catalysis of mild reactions such as in the food industry, where selectivity for the production of cis olefins is desired because of the adverse health effects of trans fats. The general synthetic methodology generated by the work is also likely to apply to the preparation of materials for other uses such as absorbents, sensors, and paints. \r\n\r\nThe knowledge deriving from this work will be used for educational purposes to illustrate basic solid-state synthesis and catalysis principles in undergraduate and graduate classes. Collaborations with Latin American research groups will be forged, and student participation from underrepresented groups in research (Hispanics in particular) will be strongly pursued. This is characteristic for this group and university.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur proposal has focused on research to develop general synthetic approaches for the preparation of catalysts with well-defined structural and/or chemical characteristics.  One of the major challenges in heterogeneous catalysis is the preparation of highly selective and robust catalysts.  Selective catalysts require lower amounts of feedstocks, avoid the need for subsequent separation steps, and minimize the generation of (potentially polluting) byproducts.  The goal is to be able to prepare solids with stable surfaces containing a large number of well-defined sites designed for the promotion of a particular reaction.  That objective has so far been quite difficult to achieve because the classical methodologies typically used for the preparation of catalysts lead to the formation of highly ill defined and varied surfaces.\n\nThe central objective of our project has been to develop general synthetic approaches for the preparation of catalysts with well-defined structural and/or chemical characteristics.  Our hypothesis has been that the new synthetic nanotechnologies advanced in recent years for the preparation of well-defined nanostructures can be best extended to the design and manufacturing of heterogeneous catalysts if the underlying physicochemistry is understood and if they are oriented to address specific catalytic functionality.\n\nTwo approaches have been explored in connection with our objectives:  (1) the implementation of nanoparticle encapsulation as a way to add stability to metal nanoparticles by using core-shell and yolk-shell nanostructures; and (2) the use of \"click\" chemistry to tether molecular functionality to solid supports as a way to develop selective heterogeneous catalysts.  \n\nMuch progress has been made in this work.  In one direction of our research, the mass transport of molecules through titania and silica shells in yolk-shell and core-shell nanostructures, structures that have become quite popular in recent times as possible individual nanoreactors, was probed in situ in liquid phase.  The first studies carried out via the detection of carbon monoxide adsorption using infrared absorption spectroscopy were later extended to larger molecules, all the way to porphyrins.  The facile nature of the mass transport was assessed by identified adsorbed species on the surface of the core nanoparticles inside these structures.\n\nIn terms of our second direction of research, on the tethering of molecular functionality to solid surfaces using \"click\" chemistry, this was first tested by assessing the catalytic performance of tethered cinchonidine for the promotion of thiol additions to conjugated ketones.  It has been assumed in many applications that the tethered molecules retain their chemical properties and dominate the chemistry of the resulting solid systems, but it was shown in our work that this is not always the case.  Indeed, a loss of enantioselectivity was observed upon tethering, which could be accounted for by a combination of at number of factors that could ultimately be minimized by silylation of the active OH groups within the surface of the oxide support, selection of solvents to optimize silane polymerization and minimize their breaking up via hydrolysis or alcoholysis reactions, and linking at defined positions in the molecule to be tethered in order to minimize its ability to interact with the surface.  The tethering approach was shown to be quite general, and has also been tested now in our laboratory for a number of other applications, including the anchoring of a Fe-cavitand homogeneous catalyst on a well-defined silica support (SBA-15) to create a selective partial oxidation heterogeneous catalyst capable of converting non-functionalized alkanes to ketones under mild (room temperature) conditions.\n\nIn a more general sense, the development of ways to design novel catalyst architectures can be extended to other areas, including, for instance, photocatalysis and solar cells.
