The US Ice Core Working Group recommended in 2003 that NSF pursue the means to take replicate samples, termed \"replicate coring\". This recommendation was part of an agreement to reduce the diameter of the (then) new drilling system (the DISC drill) core to 12.2 cm to lighten logistics burdens, and the science community accepted the reduction in ice sample with the understanding that replicate coring would be able to provide extra sample volume in key intervals. The WAIS Divide effort would particularly benefit from replicate coring, because of the unique quality of the expected gas record and the large samples needed for gases and gas isotopes; thus this proposal to employ replicate coring at WAIS Divide.  In addition, scientific demand for ice samples has been, and will continue to be, very unevenly distributed, with the ice core archive being completely depleted in depth intervals of high scientific interest (abrupt climate changes, volcanic sulfate horizons, meteor impact horizons, for example).  The broader impacts of the proposed research may include identification of leads and lags between Greenland, tropical, and Antarctic climate change, enabling critical tests of hypotheses for the mechanism of abrupt climate change. Improved understanding of volcanic impacts on atmospheric chemistry and climate may also emerge. This understanding may ultimately help improve climate models and prediction of the Earth System feedback response to ongoing human perturbation in coming centuries. Outreach and public education about climate change are integral components of the PIs' activities and the proposed work will enhance these efforts. Broader impacts also include education and training of 2 postdoctoral scholars and 1 graduate student, and invaluable field experience for the graduate and undergraduate students who will likely make up the core processing team at WAIS Divide.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA basic aspect of science is replication of findings.  When a new discovery is made, other scientists normally attempt to replicate the findings, and this process ensures that the result is valid.  However, in ice coring science, to date generally only one ice core has been recovered from a given site.  This is partially due to the large difficulty of recovering an ice core, in a harsh and remote environment.  But replicate sampling of ice is important, especially of a narrow interval that contains an extraordinary event such as a meteor impact or an abrupt climate shift.  Only by replication of the record can we be sure that this event was not an artifact, or caused by some irregularity of the snow deposition.  This award enabled the first-ever replicate coring of ice, across abrupt events, to obtain second and third cores of the same stratigraphic interval to facilitate the replication of all-important findings.\n\nThe technology to take replicate cores in ice did not exist prior to this project, so it had to be developed from scratch.  This difficult undertaking was carried out over a several year process by engineers at the Ice Drilling Design and Operations (IDDO) group at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  These talented engineers devised a set of actuator arms that fold out from the ice core drill and push the drill one direction or another, so that it can cut into the side of the borehole and take a second core.  Essentially this is a \"steerable drill\" somewhat like oil companies use to drill sideways in rock formations in search of oil pockets, except that the ice core drill only can tilt a few degrees away from the parent borehole.\n\nAll boreholes are slightly tilted from the vertical, no matter how careful the drillers were in trying to keep it vertical.  This means that every hole has a \"high side\" and a \"low side\".  The most difficult thing about this technology development was that the replicate borehole had to be made on the \"high side\" of the borehole, to prevent logging tools that follow gravity and thus the \"low side\" from inadvertently traveling down the replicate borehole.  For this reason the engineers had to fight gravity in \"pushing\" the drill out to the high side.  Overcoming this and other challenges was not easy, but ultimately they prevailed and in the 2012-2013 Antarctic summer season five replicate cores were taken across four abrupt events.  The ice core that was replicated was the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide (WAIS Divide for short) ice core, located at the flow divide of the marine-based ice sheet in West Antarctica.\n\nThese four events were: 1) The time 41, 000 years ago when the Earth's magnetic field collapsed, known as the Laschamp event, and a subsequent abrupt climate change event 38,000 years ago; 2) A massive halogen-rich volcanic eruption 18,000 years ago that may have triggered the end of the last ice age in Antarctica (2 replicate cores were taken from this particularly intriguing event); 3) An abrupt climate change event 14,700 years ago known as the B&oslash;lling Transition in which the northern hemisphere warmed in just a few decades and the Atlantic Ocean's overturning circulation restarted; and 4) A second event of abrupt warming and ocean circulation restarting that occurred 11,700 years ago that marks the end of the Pleistocene epoch and the begining of the warm stable climatic period in which civilization and agriculture developed, the Holocene epoch.\n\nThe ice in these replicate cores is precious and is being carefully allocated to investigators to maximize the science return from the samples, so much of it has not yet been destructively analyzed.  However these samples will no doubt prove extremely useful when they are ultimately analyzed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/11/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey P Severinghaus"
