The Conference is sponsored by the ASME Heat Transfer Division and Georgia Institute of Technology. The importance of nano-science and engineering has been well recognized by research communities and governmental organizations. It is believed that breakthroughs in nano-science and technology will change all aspects of the society, from energy utilization, biomedicine to homeland security. \r\n\r\nThe conference is intended to provide a forum for researchers and educators around the world to exchange the state-of-the-art research and development and identify research needs in this emerging field. The conference will include keynote and invited presentations, contributed oral and poster presentations, as well as panel discussion on the current status and future opportunities. A special issue of ASME Journal of Heat Transfer will be published after the conference for selected papers that will be reviewed according to the Journal?s review criteria.\r\n\r\nThe NSF funding will be used to subsidize the registration fees for graduate and undergraduate students so that they can enjoy all social and other functions as regular attendees with significantly reduced cost.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this conference is to promote and encourage international collaboration and interactions, especially in the new frontiers of micro/nanoscale heat and mass transfer and their impact to society. Such interactions will enable future opportunities in engineering research, including new directions and transformation research. Many of the participants will present newly research works funded by the National Science Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the conference is that it will bring together experts in nano-science and engineering which have accomplished nanoscale science and engineering researches that can affect broad areas in materials, energy, transportation, environment, national security, and health care. The conference will promote academic-government-industry collaborations and international corporations. As an effort of human resource development, young researchers, including junior faculty and graduate students, especially those from the underrepresented groups, will be particularly encouraged to attend the conference so that to provide them with opportunities of interaction and collaboration with their peers within and outside of the United States.",
