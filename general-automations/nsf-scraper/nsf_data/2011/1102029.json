 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fields Institute in Toronto will host and fund ($400,000 CAN) a Thematic Program on Discrete Geometry and its Applications, July-December 2011. This project shall provide support for two postdoctoral participants and a graduate student to the Fields thematic program. The goal of the program is to advance the understanding of discrete geometry and its relation to other parts of mathematics including packings and coverings of disks, expansive reconfigurations of spherical disks, visibility problems, optimization problems, algebraic geometry, topology, arrangements, polytopes, rigidity theory both local and global, rigidity and symmetry, geometric probability theory, and convexity as well as engineering problems related to the stability of structures, computational geometry, computational topology, computational structural biology, coding problems, and solid modeling to name a few. The common thread is the role that geometry plays and how a geometric viewpoint provides vital, often the critical insight, into the understanding of discrete structures. The program organizers have scheduled three roughly one-week focus workshops along with a Coxeter Lecture series and a Distinguished Lecture series. In addition, during July and August 2011, the Fields Institute will sponsor a program to introduce undergraduates, in the spirit of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), to many of the subjects that will be studied during the rest of the semester. Graduate courses will also be offered for students who will be attending during the semester. Significant numbers of senior and junior researchers and postdoctoral fellows will reside long-term with the program: others will make shorter visits.\r\n\r\nThis program capitalizes on the rapid development of several related areas in discrete geometry and comes at a time that is excellent for their interaction and common growth. The experienced and highly respected mathematicians, promising younger postdoctoral fellows and graduate students will have the diversity, creativity, and energy to make a significant impact on discrete geometry and its many applications for many years to come. This grant supports the training of two junior U.S. researchers and a graduate student by providing travel support and living expenses, making it possible for them to participate in the program. The participants will experience a wide range of activities including workshops, distinguished lecturer series, courses both specialized and for a general audience, day-to-day interactions for the people there, all connected with top researchers to provide guidance and direction for junior researchers and nonspecialists to provide synergy and excitement for all. The organizers, guided and overseen by the directorate of the Fields Institute will have a priority of making possible the participation and inclusion of qualified students, junior researchers, women, minorities, people with disabilities and under-represented groups. In addition, with the help of the Fields Institute infrastructure, the proposed activities will be communicated widely internationally.",
