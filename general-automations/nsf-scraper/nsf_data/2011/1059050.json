 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Quan Cheng of the University of California-Riverside is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop improved surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing and imaging techniques for better sensitivity and broader applications. The specific aims of the project are: (1) to develop microwell-confined SPR chips; (2) to develop waveguide-based SPR chips to probe conformational and structural changes stimulated by binding events; and (3) to use the techniques developed in the first two aims to study specific biomolecular interactions. Measurements parallel and perpendicular to the surface with waveguide SPR are expected to yield fundamental information pertinent to conformational and structural changes not obtainable with current SPR technologies.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the proposed research will lead to important advances in SPR, and better sensitivity with SPR imaging, which will advance high-throughput drug screening and hence impact the pharmaceutical industry and human health. Students involved in the project will receive multidisciplinary training in waveguide physics, chemistry of surface functionalization, and biology of membrane proteins and protein-ligand bindings. The results will be incorporated in advanced bioanalytical chemistry courses.",
