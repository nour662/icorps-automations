 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transforming Teaching Through Implementing Inquiry (T2I2) is a full research and development project that explores the use of cyberinfrastructure to significantly enhance the delivery and quality of professional development (PD) for grades 8-12 engineering, technology, and design educators. The goal of the project is to study whether the use of highly interactive cyberinfrastructure increases this target audience's: 1) understanding of engineering design concepts and ability to effectively teach them 2) understanding of how to address student learning needs 3) ability to manage, monitor, and adjust the learning environment 4) use of self assessment to enhance teaching ability and 5) engagement in a community of practice. These issues are of particular interest because of the limited resources in place to prepare pre-service engineering and CTE teachers, as well as a lack of in-service PD. \r\n\r\nThe content for the PD is grounded in the materials and processes of two projects reviewed by the National Research Council's (NRC) report review committee: Technology Education: Learning by Design for Middle Schools\" and \"Engineering by Design for High Schools.\"  By incorporating an object-oriented generic system design (learning objects), the cyberinfrastructure is set to be reusable, adaptable, and scalable. These learning objects allow for customization of the learning experience, whereby learning facilitators or learners themselves can configure the system based on their specific needs.  Delivering learning objects in an online framework enables teachers to develop and grow in a network community.\r\n\r\nA mixed methods approach is used to determine effects of professional development. Student achievement is measured by comparing each site's state assessments in the following areas: the curriculum's technology, engineering, and design assessment, end-of-grade mathematics assessment, and end-of-grade science assessment. Both formative and summative evaluation strategies inform the development and implementation of the project. As such, the project will advance theory, design, and practice in middle and high school engineering, technology and design-based classrooms.",
