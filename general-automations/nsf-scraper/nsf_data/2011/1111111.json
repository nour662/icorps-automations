 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing availability of large numbers of high-quality digital records from the global seismic networks has made possible a variety of new ways to study earthquakes and deep Earth structure.  By analyzing hundreds or thousands of seismograms, it is often possible to resolve new features in the data, or to perform more comprehensive analyses of problems that were previously addressed on smaller scales.   This project will continue analyses of global seismic data at U.C. San Diego to examine a variety of geophysical issues.  These include:  (1) Examining the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary using receiver functions and SS precursors,  (2) Imaging earthquake rupture using back-projection methods, (3) Observation and modeling of scattered energy between major body-wave seismic phases to constrain the statistical properties of mantle heterogeneity at scale lengths shorter than can be resolved using seismic tomography, (4) Systematic searches for (and tests of prior claims of) the inner-core shear phase PKJKP. This project supports the educational program at U.C. San Diego by providing funds for graduate and postdoctoral students.  This research is likely to lead to improved models of Earth structure and earthquake rupture processes, which will be of interest to the tectonics, geodynamics and mineral physics communities.  Results will be widely disseminated through publications, conference presentations, and material provided to SIO?s education and outreach programs. \r\n\r\nNetworks of global seismic stations now record vast amounts of data, which have a wealth of information about both earthquakes and deep Earth structure.  However, analysis of these data has lagged because traditional methods are time-intensive and do not fully exploit the capabilities of modern computers.  By applying automated methods to hundreds or thousands of seismograms, it is often possible to resolve new features in the data, or to perform more comprehensive analyses of problems that were previously addressed on smaller scales.  This U.C. San Diego project develops and applies these new methods to examine a variety of topics.  These include:  (1) Probing the boundary between Earth's relatively rigid upper layer and the more plastic layer below, (2) Examining earthquake rupture using high-frequency seismic waves, (3) Studying scattered seismic waves to understand the frequency and strength of small-scale structures in the deep Earth, and (4) Testing the solidity of Earth's inner core through study of a hard-to-observe seismic wave arrival called PKJKP.  This research is likely to lead to improved models of Earth structure and earthquake rupture processes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe increasing availability of large numbers of high-quality digital records from the global seismic networks has made possible a variety of new ways to study earthquakes and deep Earth structure.  By analyzing hundreds or thousands of seismograms, it is often possible to resolve new features in the data, or to perform more comprehensive analyses of problems that were previously addressed on smaller scales.   This project performed analyses of global seismic data to examine a variety of geophysical issues.  To better understand earthquakes, seismic records were back-projected to the source to resolve rupture details at higher frequencies than in traditional earthquake analyses.  Results from several major earthquakes, including the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan and the 2015 Nepal earthquake, revealed a great deal of source complexity, with multiple sub-events and frequency-dependent rupture behavior.  Another significant discovery was that a large aftershock of the 2013 Sea of Okhotsk earthquake ruptured at unusually high velocity, exceeding the local shear-wave velocity.  Deep Earth structure at 10 to 100 km scale lengths is hard to probe with traditional seismology methods, but can be constrained using the scattered seismic wave energy that arrives between the main seismic wave arrivals.  This approach confirmed that weak scattering is present throughout Earth's lower mantle and that the strength of upper-mantle heterogeneity is roughly constant over a wide range of scale lengths.  The Earth's inner core is known to be solid based on observations of the Earth's free oscillations, but direct evidence from seismic body waves has been lacking, such as observation of the inner-core shear phase named PKJKP.  However, analysis of both real data and numerical simulations shows that this is not surprising given that the expected amplitude of PKJIP is below noise levels.  The project provided support for two graduate students and two postdocs.
