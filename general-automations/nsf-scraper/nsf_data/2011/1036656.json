The workshop brings together leading theorists in conservation laws and in continuum mechanics, and aims to stimulate work at the interface between these fields and to inform young researchers about recent developments in the area.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop will enhance communication among junior and senior researchers in conservation laws and continuum mechanics.  Conference proceedings will be published in the Quarterly of Applied Mathematics of the American Mathematical Society.  The conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students, junior researchers, and members of under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  http://www.dam.brown.edu/HyperbolicConf/",
