 "awd_abstract_narration": "One important new frontier of cosmology is the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), marking the time when the Universe's first luminous objects formed and the time of the final phase of cosmological formation of structure in the Universe.  Most investigators seek to observe the EoR by detecting neutral hydrogen gas of the intergalactic medium (IGM) through its signature in the redshifted 21-cm spectral line.  While a variety of projects are currently underway to detect the EoR signal, thermal noise will dominant the signal and will require careful statistical analysis of the observational data to infer the statistical nature of the EoR signal.  Unfortunately, one of the statistical techniques employed will be to characterize power spectrum of the EoR signal even though this signal is expected to be non-Gaussian.\r\n\r\nThe intent of this project is to systematically explore statistics that reach far beyond the power spectrum technique.  The investigators will compute radiative transfer simulations of reionization for a wide variety of well-defined theoretical models.  Expected thermal noise, foreground corruption, and instrumental distortions will next be added to the simulations to produce complete simulations of observational sky maps in 21 cm.  The investigators will next measure a range of statistics on these simulated observational maps to characterize the most robust useful information obtainable from the EoR signal.\r\n\r\nEducationally, an undergraduate will receive support and mentoring at one institution, and graduate students at two institutions will receive support and mentoring.  An important feature of student training in this project is the interdisciplinary nature of the research including complex statistical analysis, analytical and numerical simulations, instrumental modeling, and astrophysics.  The student experience will also emphasize the interconnection between experimental conditions and scientific analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding the formation of early stars and galaxies during the first billion years of the Universe is a key frontier in astrophysics.  One approach is to use radio telescopes to study the influence of early galaxies on the primordial gas surrounding them.  However, there are significant observational and theoretical challenges that must be overcome. Observationally, strong foreground sources impede the ability of the telescopes to isolate the cosmology signal, while theoretically, it is not clear how best to extract astrophysical information about early stars and galaxies from the expected radio features in observations.\n\nThis project addressed both categories of challenges.  We developed a software pipeline to simulate observations from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA).  We used the pipeline to study artifacts introduced into the observations by the telescopes.  We then explored the robustness of several statistical metrics for identifying underlying information about early galaxies.\n\nOur simulations led to the identification of a previously unknown foreground contamination in widefield low-frequency radio observations that we then verified with MWA observations.   We also found that the MWA may be able to detect the effects of early galaxies based on the skewness of pixel values in images produced by the telescope.  Lastly, our simulations helped to establish design specficiations for the upcoming HERA telescope.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Judd D Bowman"
