 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent years have seen rapid growth in the depth, richness, and scope of\r\nscientific data, a trend that is likely to accelerate. At the same time, \r\nsimulation and analytical models have sharpened to unprecedented detail\r\nthe understanding of the processes that generate these data. But what has \r\nadvanced more slowly is the methodology to efficiently combine the information \r\nfrom rich, massive data sets with the detailed, and often nonlinear, \r\nconstraints of theory and simulations. This project will bridge that gap.\r\nThe investigators develop, implement, and disseminate new statistical methods\r\nthat can fully exploit the available data by adhering to the constraints \r\nimposed by current theoretical understanding. The central idea in the \r\nwork is constructing sparse, possibly nonlinear, representations of both \r\nthe data and the distributions for the data predicted by theory. These \r\nrepresentations can then be transformed onto a common space to allow sharp \r\ninferences that respect the inherent geometry of the model. The methodology \r\ndeveloped in this project will apply to a wide range of scientific problems.\r\nThe investigators focus, however, on a critical challenge in astronomy: using \r\nobservations of Type Ia supernovae to improve constraints on cosmological \r\ntheories explaining the nature of dark energy, a significant, yet little-\r\nunderstood, component of the Universe.\r\n\r\nCrucial scientific fields have enjoyed huge advances in the ability both to\r\ngather high-quality data and to understand the physical systems that generated \r\nthese data. Nevertheless, the full societal and scientific value of \r\nthis progress will only be realized with new, advanced statistical methods of\r\nanalyzing the massive amounts of available data. The investigators develop \r\nstatistical methods for combining theoretical modelling and observational evidence into \r\nimproved understanding of these physical processes. The analysis of these data will \r\nrequirenot only new methods, but also the use of high-performance computing resources. There is a particular need for these tools in cosmology and astronomy, and this project will bring together statisticians and astronomers to combine expertise, but this research is motivated by problems that are present in other fields, such as the climate sciences.",
