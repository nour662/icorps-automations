 "awd_abstract_narration": "Processing of Chromatic Information in the Peripheral Retina\r\n\t\r\nThere are two types of light detectors in the human retina, rods and cones.  Cones perform best in daylight conditions, whereas rods are specialized for night vision. In the daylight, humans are able to perceive color. This is because there are three different types of cones, each picking up on different spectrums of color (blue, green, and red). At night, human color perception is relatively impaired.\r\n\r\nThis study focuses on how the cones and rods operate under less than ideal conditions; conditions where both rods and cones are detecting light at the same time but neither detector is operating at its best.  Such lighting conditions would be comparable to those experienced at dawn or dusk.  The reason for this study is that for many years it has been assumed that rods do not contribute to our ability to perceive color, even under conditions where both rods and cones are detecting the presence of light.  It is now known that rods alter color perception, so the color of an object seen under daylight conditions may not be the same as the color seen at dawn or dusk.  When color is used to convey information, but lighting conditions under which the color is viewed are changing, the information provided by color may not be accurate.  The goal of this study is determine under what conditions failures in color perception arise and how the visual system may compensate for these failures. The results from this project may be applied to the design of color monitors, the efficacy of color information dissemination, and the design of cockpit and/or video displays.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n  The retina is composed of four different types of receptors that detect light; three of these receptors are called cones and operate optimally under daylight conditions while the fourth is known as rods and operates optimally under low light levels.  It is often assumed that the rods and cones function independently of each other, yet under certain light conditions, such as dawn or dusk, both receptors are operating at the same time, although these conditions known as mesopic light levels are not optimal for light detection by either receptor type.  Further complicating the matter is that across the retina the density and distribution of these receptors varies.  For example, in the center of the retina there are no rods but in the peripheral retina there are both rods and cones with more rods than cones. \n\n  Color perception is often attributed to the activation of the cones, yet from earlier studies rods have been assumed to desaturate stimuli (i.e., stimuli appear pale or dark such that a red with rod input may appear pink or maroon) or make an object appear bluer.  Trying to parcel out the contribution of cones versus rods can be tricky, but experimental procedures have been devised to study color perception in the peripheral retina whereby rod activation is minimized or maximized.  From these studies, it has been shown that 1) the effect of rods on color perception is greater for smaller stimuli than larger stimuli even though more rods are supposedly activated with the larger stimulus, 2) rods not only desaturate stimuli but can alter the percent of red, green, blue and yellow used to describe stimuli, 3) across the visible spectrum a greater range of wavelengths will appear yellow/green for a large stimulus presented in the peripheral retina than for a similar activating stimulus presented to the fovea, 4) the color of large stimuli presented under bleach and no-bleach conditions in the peripheral retina is similar, indicating cones may be suppressing rod activity with large stimuli, 5) large stimuli in the peripheral retina with little to no rod input are still different than similar stimuli presented to the fovea. indicating that chromatic processing of stimuli is different in the two retinal locations even though the same types of cones are detecting the light, and 6) under some conditions with large stimuli, color perception can be \"better\" in the peripheral retina than in the fovea, i.e., the stimulus is more saturated with less of an achromatic component.  This later finding is a bit counterintuitive since it is assumed that vision is better in the central retina (fovea).  When a stimulus is detected in the peripheral retina, we often move our eyes so that stimulus is detected by the receptors in the fovea (center retina), permitting a better view of the stimulus.\n\n  Given the differences in the density and distribution of the photodetectors in the retina and the differences in hue perception between the peripheral retinal and the fovea, it is surprising that when a large stimulus covers both the fovea and peripheral retina we perceive a stimulus that is spatially uniform in hue.  What causes this uniformity?  Is information from the fovea and peripheral retina averaged to create the uniform percept or does the fovea or periphery dominate the perception?  Our laboratory has shown that the peripheral retina dominates and determines hue perception when large stimuli cover both the fovea and periphery.\n\n  Lastly, many experiments investigating peripheral hue perception are conducted monocularly with one eye, yet objects in our environment are normally viewed with two eyes, binocularly.  It is known that when an object is viewed with both eyes the light reflected from the object falls on different locations in the two eyes.  The density and distribution of the rods and cones differ between the two eyes and when an object is viewed monocularly the color of the object differs between the two eyes, yet we perceive the ..."
