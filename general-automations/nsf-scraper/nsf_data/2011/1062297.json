Students are working on either an adapted physical activity capstone project or an industry-sponsored capstone project. Quantitative instruments are being developed to measure students' motivation, design self-efficacy, and attitudes toward people with disabilities. Qualitative assessments that consist of student reflections and focus group interviews are also being conducted. The project helps increase the understanding of student motivation, perceptions of engineering design, and the principles of inclusion.",
