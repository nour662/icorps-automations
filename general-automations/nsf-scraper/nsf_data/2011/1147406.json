 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing has enabled immense innovations in many fields and social\r\nlife due to continued performance, power, and cost improvements\r\nenabled by technology scaling. Unfortunately, two key trends threaten\r\nperformance and cost improvement of computers going into the\r\nfuture. First, technology scaling is at jeopardy, leading to major\r\nchallenges in power consumption, reliability, and performance. Second,\r\npower and energy consumption has become a key constraint, yet existing\r\nsystems are mostly designed in a one-size-fits-all way agnostic to the\r\nneeds of different applications. To overcome both problems, this\r\nresearch investigates novel uses of heterogeneous technologies in\r\nthree key components of a computing system: cores, interconnect, and\r\nmemory. The approach taken is an application-driven approach that aims\r\nto seamlessly integrate heterogeneity in the three components. Major\r\nexpected contributions of the research include: (1) an initial study\r\nof first-principles based and application-driven design of cores, (2)\r\nnew mechanisms for enabling phase-change memory based heterogeneous\r\nmain memory, (3) exploration of tradeoffs in the design of\r\n3-dimensional optical interconnects, (4) initial exploration of the\r\ninteraction of heterogeneous components in cores, interconnect, and\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research has the potential to transform the design and\r\narchitecture of future multi-core systems, which are already a part of\r\nthe entire IT sector and our daily lives. It can enable overcoming key\r\nchallenges that impediment higher-performance and lower-power\r\nlower-cost computing, which has traditionally enabled new applications\r\nand discoveries.  Enabling fundamentally efficient heterogeneous\r\nmulti-core systems can largely reduce energy and technology-scaling\r\ncosts of computing, and improve dependability and performance. Direct\r\ntransfer of many ideas to industry are expected through extensive\r\ncollaborations with platform and chip design industries.",
