 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological signaling processes help organisms respond to changes in their environment and to ensure proper regulation of their internal processes. Biological signaling starts when a receptor protein is activated by interaction with a signal. Two important fields of research in biological signaling are (i) the structural and chemical properties of isolated receptor proteins and (ii) the identification of signaling pathways in living cells and organisms. This project will use a bacterial photoreceptor called photoactive yellow protein (PYP) as a model system to obtain a direct link between these two research areas. Until recently, bacterial photoreceptors were thought to be specialized proteins present only in a small number of phototrophic bacteria. Unexpectedly, bacterial genome sequencing projects have revealed that many chemotrophs also contain photosensory proteins. This project will explore this developing area of bacterial photosensing. The research will explore the function of PYPs in a number of very different bacterial organisms, will examine the signal transduction chain associated with PYP, and will uncover which of the structural and chemical changes that are known to occur upon the light activation of PYP are required for signaling in the living bacterial cell.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts. Fundamental aspects of bacterial signaling will be explored, particularly the role of partial protein unfolding as a novel signaling mechanism. An increased understanding of biological signaling will have implications for a range of relevant areas, including biotechnology. Undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities will be actively involved in the proposed research. In addition, a series of presentations in the successful \"Stillwater Science Caf\u00e9\" will be organized. These presentations will be aimed at elementary school students and involve interactive presentations and hands-on demonstrations by OSU faculty members on their current research in the biological life sciences. This will increase understanding of and appreciation for science in elementary school students.",
