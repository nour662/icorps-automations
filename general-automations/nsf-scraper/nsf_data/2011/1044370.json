 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is developing inquiry-based animated case studies of complex physiological processes (diffusion, osmosis and filtration) and critically assessing their effect on student learning when introduced into large introductory college biology classes. This study is being designed to determine if students using animated case studies, when compared to those using only still images abstracted from the animations, will: (1) have greater learning gains regarding the dynamic nature of the physiological processes, and (2) be more engaged in science.  Qualitative observations are being used to gauge student engagement in the case studies.  Feedback from students participating in this study is being used to improve the existing case studies and to identify other physiological processes to serve as the focus of future case studies for introductory biology classes.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This project is providing critical information for animation designers, teachers, science education researchers, and curriculum designers. As a consequence, the outcomes of this study will advance the current knowledge base in several fields, and have the potential to be transformative on how complex biological processes are taught. New insights into why and when animated case studies lead to better student learning than case studies containing still images is an important potential contribution of this study.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The results of this study could be relevant not only for science instructors, science education researchers, and curriculum designers, but also for animation and educational game designers and could contribute to establishing new guidelines for the design of animations used in the science classroom, and for the assessment of learning with animations. In addition, by incorporating the animated case studies into the introductory biology curriculum, interested biology students will be recruited to collaborate with science education and animation undergraduate students in the planning and design of new animated processes, highlighting other biological processes that students find difficult to master. The animations and research findings will be presented at national and international biology professional society meetings including those of the American Physiological Society and at Science Education Research conferences. The designers of the animations will present them at national Digital Media conferences. The graduate and undergraduate students will present their research findings in departmental seminars and at statewide conferences.  Partnership with Morehouse College broadens the spectrum of students and faculty involved.",

The specifc objective of our study was to test the effectiveness of inquiry-based online case studies based on three fundamental biological processes (diffusion, osmosis and filtration) on student learning into large introductory biology classes. It was our expectation that students will learn challenging biological processes significantly better when their learning is supported with an engaging real-life scenario, in which they work as veterinarians, physician assistants, or nurses, to solve a health-related problem that is based in one of these challenging processes. We also expected that for these dynamic processes animated case studies will lead to greater learning gains than corresponding case studies containing still images from the animations. This was indeed the case. We tested student learning with online case studies in large (500+) introductory biology classes, and our results clearly show that students were engaged when learning with online cases (both animated and not), and students generally liked doing them. They commented on how these made them realize why they were learning the material, and all students significantly improved their knowledge and application skills. To test the impact of animated illustrations versus still images on student learning, we implemented three supervised online homework sessions for 500+ students every spring semester, with half of the students (randomly assigned) doing the animated case studies and the other half doing the cases with still images. We have analyzed the final exam performance (longer-term learning gains) of 550 introductory biology students, connected these data with their pre/post assessments (immediate learning gains) for the osmosis case study, and with student answers on the embedded case questions (case use, engagement and learning during the case). We refined our newly developed methodology for analyzing student learning gains, which includes an IRT analysis followed by a class transition analysis (Yang et al. 2015). We are currently writing up our osmosis case results in two manuscripts. The analysis of our other two case studies is in progress and will also be published. In general, students using animated images, learned more than students using still images. We are presently analyzing where the animations made a difference, and specifically, whether the understanding of the dynamic changes is impacted, as we predicted. Importantly, male and female students learned equally well (in contrast to lecture-based courses, where male students tend to have an advantage). Learning was observed across question types (remembering, knowledge application, process application), and we are presently analyzing all student answers to learn what they can tell us about student cognitive processing behind these question types. Together with information on the answer path that students took through the case, how much time they spend on each page, how long it took them to answer each embedded question, and the answer quality, this will help us identify effective (and ineffective) case study elements, which will be shared with case developers (and published). These insights will aid the development of even better technology-based learning supports for introductory biology students towards their mastery of challenging concepts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/05/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kathrin&nbsp;F&nbsp;Stanger-Hall</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
