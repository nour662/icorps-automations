 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to refine and implement a recently developed technique for estimating the altitude profile of neutral winds in the equatorial mesosphere/lower thermosphere between 85-115 km from high-resolution radar observations of non-specular meteor trails.  This effort will utilize incoherent scatter radar (ISR) observations of velocities, deceleration, and change in deceleration of meteoroids acquired from Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO) in Peru.  The project will include an evaluation of new radar transmission modes for routine wind determination, which will be used to assemble a database of wind estimates.  The measurements in turn will be used to create more realistic simulations of meteor trail evolution using a massively parallel, multi-dimensional hybrid numerical code developed over the past several years by the Principle Investigator as well as used to improve neutral density estimates between 80 and 120 km.  The simulations and meteor observations will be used to address broad questions regarding the nature of radar scatter from the meteor plasma.  This effort will involve participation by multiple graduate and undergraduate students over three institutions.",

For the last 50 years, optics and radars have characterized these meteor plasmas in order to infer properties of the meteoroids (speed, direction of origin, size) and the atmosphere in which they disintigrate (winds and temperatures). In the last decade, the aeronomy research community has made dramatic improvements in understanding the observational characteristics of radar meteors and their underlying physics. They have improved the measurements both of the meteors and the atmosphere they travel through. The objective of this project was to further develop this field in two directions: (1) improve high-resolution atmospheric measurements made with radar meteor observations and (2) to better understand and model meteor physics. Meteor physics plays an important role in many areas of space science and aeronomy. Aeronomers need to know the amount and location of meteoric material deposited in the Earth's atmosphere. Current estimates of the total amount deposited range between 1,600 and 170,000 tons per year but this wide range makes atmospheric modeling ambiguous. Aeronomers also need better estimates of meteoroid composition in order to understand the effects of metals such as Na and Fe on upper atmospheric chemistry. Since 1991, four satellites were seriously damaged by meteoroids; the shuttle's windows have been hit by over 20 meteoroids with enough energy to require replacement; and the Hubble telescope has received more than 5000 meteoroid impacts.
