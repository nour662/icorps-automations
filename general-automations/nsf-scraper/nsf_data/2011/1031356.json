 "awd_abstract_narration": "US college and universities are experiencing a dramatic decline in enrollment of computing majors, despite a predicted, rapid increase in future jobs in the computer science (CS) and information technology (IT) sectors. This reflects a decline in the number of students taking the AP computer science exam. To address this issue, this project will build statewide networks of college, middle school, and high school faculty who will offer workshops and provide continuing support during the academic year. \r\n\r\nThe networks will be set up in three different states (North Carolina, South Carolina, and Mississippi). College and university faculty will work directly with middle school and high school teachers in teaching and learning innovative and effective ways of introducing computing and computer programming, and in incorporating computational thinking into other disciplines. This project scales up a previous, successful collaborative project for students and teachers using the Alice 3D programming environment. The approach focuses on a strong core of fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques in an object-oriented, interactive environment. The project's external evaluation will include the collection of qualitative and quantitative data on teacher instruction and students' enrollment and performance. \r\n\r\nThe project will train approximately 265 teachers directly, and provide support for master teachers to provide subsequent training for other teachers in their home districts. This project has the potential to increase the amount and effectiveness of instruction in object-oriented programming concepts and problem-solving to a large number of middle school and high school students. By training middle school and high school teachers in the proposed approach, and by providing support networks and building community, the project should be able to impact students throughout three states. Developed curricular materials will be stored in an online, searchable database to be freely available to all teachers. In making computing, computer science, programming, and computational thinking more attractive to middle school and high school students, the project team expects to encourage more students to major in STEM, and particularly computing, at the college level.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Computing is a new field that in the past few years, has become one of the largest majors at many institutions. Its importance and popularity have come about as technology is increasingly intertwining with our daily lives, and predictions are indicating a shortage of technology workers in the future.<br /><br />However, K-12 education has been slow in incorporating computer science into all grade levels. One of the reasons why is that schools have \"technology\" or \"digital media\" courses. These typically teach keyboarding lessons and how to use software tools, such as word processor or spreadsheets. That is not computer science! Computer science is about using computational techniques to solve problems, especially problems that would be too difficult to solve with pencil and paper. Because of misconceptions between technology and computer science, schools have been slow to incorporate computer science into their curriculum.<br /><br />Our project is called Adventures with Alice Programming. Since 2007 with an ITEST grant followed by this ITEST Scale up grant, we have provided annual professional development to K-12 teachers to learn programming, and to guide them in creating lesson plans that integrate computing into their discipline. The Alice programming language is a free programming environment for novices to learn programming by creating animations of 3-D objects in a virtual world. Alice was created by Randy Pausch at CMU.<br /><br />Our major activity is providing professional development to teachers to learn programming and to guide them in creating lesson plans.&nbsp; We have sites in the states of North Carolina (NC), South Carolina (SC), California (CA) and Nebraska (NE).&nbsp; These sites run professional development workshops on Alice for middle school/high school teachers. The NC and SC workshops have run beginner workshops since summer 2011 and followup workshops every summer since 2012.&nbsp; The CA site ran workshops in summer 2014 and 2015. The Nebraska workshop started running workshops in summer 2016.&nbsp; The NC workshops are held at Duke University, the SC workshops at the College of Charleston and Columbia College, the CA workshops in the San Francisco/San Jose area, and the NE workshops in Lincoln, Nebraska.<br /><br />All professional development workshops are residential two-week workshops. In the first week, teachers learn fundamental programming by building Alice programs. During the second week, teachers develop lesson plans in their discipline. The following summer, teachers attend a followup workshop where teachers present material they have developed or student work, and we provide some instruction or updates to Alice.<br /><br />We have also organized four large Alice Symposia at Duke University since 2006 to build community, with two of the symposia as part of this grant. Beginner and followup workshops are held at the same time so beginners can learn from the followup teachers, and the followup teachers can present in a larger venue. We also schedule other short workshops around the Symposium for followup teachers to gain new knowledge. The Third Alice Symposium took place on June 19, 2013. The program included a Keynote by Tiffany Barnes from NCSU, papers, posters, invited speakers and an Alice contest for students. We organized six workshops on Alice or related topics in conjunction with the Symposium. The Symposium and workshops were attended by over 120 participants. The fourth Alice Symposium was held on June 20, 2017. The program included a Keynote by Thomas Price from NCSU, five invited talks, and teacher demos.&nbsp; A Workshop on Alice 2 to Alice 3 was held the next day, organized by Wanda Dann and Don Slater. There were 81 attendees at the Alice Symposium and 28 people attended the Alice 2 to Alice 3 Workshop.<br /><br />Our findings indicate that our summer professional development workshops were both positive and productive for participants. Those teachers participating in our study indicated that workshops helped them to increase their knowledge, skills, and abilities with Alice. Those respondents demonstrated learning effective instructional strategies for translating the information to their classrooms. For all the sites, the participants increased their content knowledge using Alice, as evidenced by significant gains on content assessments. Complementing these increases in knowledge, respondents provided praise for instructors and sessions, rating them as valuable and worthwhile in developing their pedagogical skill with using Alice in their own classroom lessons.<br /><br />The programming language Alice has been introduced by teachers attending our workshops to over 10,000 students.&nbsp; We have presented Alice at conferences from NC to Beijing, and we have used Alice in outreach activities.&nbsp; The free curriculum materials we have developed are on our web page.&nbsp; Google analytics on our website shows from Sept 2012 to Sept 14, 2018 that we have had over 50,700 users, over 66,800 sessions and over 88,000 page views at our website, with 80% of the traffic in the United States.&nbsp; We have been contacted by teachers all over the United States who said they are using our curriculum materials.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/10/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Roxann&nbsp;H&nbsp;Stalvey</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1031356/1031356_10095379_1539141483840_Group2016--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1031356/1031356_10095379_1539141483840_Group2016--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Teachers 2016 Worshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1031356/1031356_10095379_1539141483840_Group2016--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Teachers 2016 Worshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Teachers from 2016 SC Workshop at College of Charleston</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">RoxAnn Stalvey</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Roxann&nbsp;H&nbsp;Stalvey</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Teachers 2016 Worshop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1031356/1031356_10095379_1539141705820_classroom--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1031356/1031356_10095379_1539141705820_classroom--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Classroom\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1031356/1031356_10095379_1539141705820_classroom--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Classroom\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Teachers during workshop at workstations.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">RoxAnn Stalvey</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Roxann&nbsp;H&nbsp;Stalvey</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Classroom</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1031356/1031356_10095379_1539141967235_capture04--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1031356/1031356_10095379_1539141967235_capture04--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Teacher Produced World  1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1031356/1031356_10095379_1539141967235_capture04--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Teacher Produced World  1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Teacher produced MTV Video -
