 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to discover the ecological and evolutionary processes that govern host specificity of insect parasitoids of ants in the fly family Phoridae. As a group, these parasitoids consist of several 100 species in the Neotropical Region, most of which are extremely specialized, attacking one or a few closely related ant species. The research group, consisting of a natural products chemist, an evolutionary biologist and a behavioral ecologist, will focus on the chemical signals host ants use in communication (pheromones) as the primary cue by which the parasitoids locate hosts and lay their eggs in them. Once the chemical signals parasitoids use to find hosts are identified, the investigators will experimentally quantify the limits of host specificity by attracting parasitoids and inducing them to oviposit novel hosts to see if they develop normally. These chemical signals will then be mapped onto the phylogenetic tree of hosts and compared to the phylogenetic tree of the parasitoids to determine how the distribution of chemical signals shape the evolution of host specificity and shifts to novel hosts. Results of the project will have broad application to insect parasitoids and the potential for biological control of insect pests. Educational and outreach goals of the project include: 1) training US, Latin American and Caribbean graduate and undergraduate students in natural products chemistry and the ecological, behavioral and evolutionary aspects of life history specialization in insects; 2) training secondary school science teachers in the process of scientific research; and 3) using the results and products of the project to develop inquiry-based learning activities (IBAs) for Utah K-12 classrooms. These IBAs will focus on scientific issues such as conservation and biodiversity, adaptations and species interactions, and the family tree of life, all of which are part of the Utah state science core curriculum.",

Our experimental system included parasitoid species in the <em>Apocephalus miricauda</em>-species group, which are attracted to and lay eggs in injured ants. Experiments in the field showed that chemical compounds in the mandibular glands of hosts are both long-range host location cues and short-range oviposition cues for these parasitoids. Parasitoids can be induced to lay eggs in non-host species if chemical signals from a host species is present nearby. Analysis of the chemical compounds in the mandibular glands of ant species in the genus <em>Odontomachus</em> showed there was broad overlap in the alkyl-dimethylpyrazines present, but that each species nonetheless had a unique chemical signature. There was no obvious phylogenetic signal in mandibular gland contents among species. If this variation in mandibular gland contents is basis for host specificity in these parasitoids, then it is not surprising that we did not find strong evidence for a matching between the phylogeny of <em>Odontomachus</em> host species and the parasitoids that use them. The pattern of host use by parasitoids is determined more by the distributed of chemical signals than by the phylogenetic affinities of the hosts.

Our phylogeny of the Phoridae is the first comprehensive phylogeny based on molecular characters. The phylogeny of the Phoridae suggests that the use of injured or recently dead hosts evolved independently several times and, at least in the <em>A. miricauda</em>- species group, it appears that this pattern of host use is a derived from the use of live, healthy hosts.
