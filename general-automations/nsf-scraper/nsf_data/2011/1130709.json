 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lead PI has been working on th inversion of the refraction arrivals from all multi-channel seismic data from Atlantis Massif which is now complete. They are funded to incorporate these velocity models of the shallow crust in a re-examination of the reflectivity, extending the prior MCS analyses by other investigators. There are reflectors within the Oceanic Core Complex at Atlantis Massif at depths below the paths of the refracted waves. Incorporating these events in new tomographic inversions will extend current models into the core of the massif. The PIs also hope that the study will advance knowledge beyond current depths and will determine what type of experiment(s) can obtain seismic constraints across the full depth range necessary to truly test the models.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts include postdoctoral training, enhancing the outcomes of IODP drilling investments in igneous oceanic lithosphere, and development/sharing of tools for seismic analysis of shallow lithospheric structure. The work will also support two current IODP proposals under consideration for scheduling. Insights obtained on the seismic properties of intrusive ocean crust may feed into research/planning for a deep crustal and mantle penetration (MoHole) by the next ocean drilling program.",
