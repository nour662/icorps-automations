 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to improve physical understanding of Graphene - the thinnest possible sheet of just atomic thickness. In addition to its remarkable mechanical strength, Graphene has tantalizing electronic, magnetic, and optical properties which could lead to a host of applications ranging from nanoelectronics, highly sensitive sensors, strong materials and energy storage devices among others. One property missing from Graphene is the so-called \"piezoelectricity,\" which allows a voltage to be developed when a material is mechanically deformed and vice-versa. Thus the specific research objective of this investigation is to elucidate \"if\" and \"how\" Graphene can be endowed with piezoelectricity (even though it may not be expected to exhibit such behavior ...). Advanced quantum mechanical calculations and state-of-the-art fabrication and testing techniques will be employed to realize such goals.\r\n\r\nThis project puts forth a high-risk high-payoff concept and, if successful, will establish a new paradigm in creating multifunctional materials and the use of Graphene as the thinnest material capable of a variety of functions - sensing and actuation, among others.  Piezoelectricity is important in a host of applications where both sensing and actuation are needed - piezoelectric Graphene, for example, could be used to create artificial muscles.  Other potential applications range from biomedical to space. Graduate and undergraduate students working on the project will develop a strong foundation in the highly multidisciplinary areas of nanotechnology, computational materials science and mechanics. Plans are in place to reach out to school-children through the concept of \"Science behind Harry Potter.\"",

The low surface energy of the C-F bond also enables one to tailor the surface characteristics and charge, in this case, by chemically altering the C/O and C/F ratio on the graphene basal plane. We developed a one-pot methodology to synthesize bulk quantities of 2-dimensional (2D) nanoflakes of fluorinated graphene oxides (FGOs) with different C/O and C/F ratios. Fluorine is covalently bonded to the graphitic domain in the form of aliphatic C-F bonds, in addition to epoxy, hydroxyl and carbonyl moieties that typically exist on the surface of GO. Ease of the solution processing leads to fabrication of FGO-based \u00e6inks\u00c6 in volatile, organic solvents, that have been sprayed on a range of porous and smooth surfaces to create thin films (1 &ndash; 100 &micro;m). In addition to the simple spray-painting, thin films of superhydrophobic FGO were also obtained via drop-casting and..."
