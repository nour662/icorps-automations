 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award to Princeton University funds U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by the G8 Research Councils Initiative on Multilateral Research through the Interdisciplinary Program on Application Software towards Exascale Computing for Global Scale Issues. This is a pilot collaboration among the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Canadian National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), the German Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR),and the United Kingdom Research Councils (RC-UK), supporting collaborative research projects selected on a competitive basis that are comprised of researchers from at least three of the partner countries. \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this international project involving collaborating researchers in three countries  is the development of sophisticated 3D seismic imaging tools for the characterization of earthquakes, Earth 'noise', and mapping of Earth's interior on all scales. The research affects the fields of exploration geophysics, regional and global seismology, and even helioseismology.  The proposed research ensures that seismologists will be able to effectively and efficiently harness future high performance computers.   The project will develop and enhance open-source software for the simulation of 3D seismic wave propagation in acoustic, (an)elastic and poroelastic media on hierarchical computer architectures.  These simulations account for heterogeneity in the crust and mantle, topography, anisotropy, attenuation, fluid-solid interactions, self-gravitation, rotation, and the oceans. A major goal is to be able to routinely and efficiently reach a shortest period of 1 s in global simulations, the shortest period signal that propagates across our planet. \r\n\r\nThis NSF award supports the education and training of a postdoc. Software developed during the course of the proposed research period will be made freely available via the Computational Infrastructure for   Geodynamics (CIG). The award also supports the further development and enhancement of the southern California and global ShakeMovie web sites.",
