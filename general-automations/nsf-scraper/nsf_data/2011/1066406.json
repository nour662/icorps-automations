Accurate theoretical modeling of the lattice thermal conductivity is essential to numerous fields including microelectronics cooling, thermoelectrics, and even planetary science.  The goal of this collaborative research effort between Boston College and Cornell University will be to implement a theoretical approach to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of crystalline and alloyed materials from first principles. A central feature of this approach is that it has no adjustable parameters.\r\nThe Cornell site will focus on calculating ab initio harmonic and, where required, anharmonic interatomic force constants (IFCs) for the materials and structures to be investigated.  These calculations will be based on density functional perturbation theory.  The IFCs are required inputs for phonon dispersions, phonon density of states, and phonon thermal transport calculations from which the lattice thermal conductivity is obtained.  The materials to be studied in this project include lead chalcogenides, I-V-VI2 semiconductors, and nanoparticle-in-alloy-structures.\r\nThe first principles approach has already demonstrated excellent agreement with measured high thermal conductivities of group IV semiconductors. The materials to be studied in this project are unified by their exceptionally low thermal conductivities and therefore provide an excellent test of the robustness of the theory.  The measured thermal properties of many of these materials are well characterized and will provide an important check of our calculated adjustable parameter-free results. Good agreement with measured data would further validate the predictive capability of this state-of-the-art theory in studying and understanding thermal transport and the lattice thermal conductivity in a wide range of materials for many thermal management applications.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:  Current theories of the lattice thermal conductivity of materials are typically based on either highly parameterized relaxation time approximations or on purely classical molecular dynamics calculations. The rigorous first principles theory proposed here has no adjustable parameters and incorporates fully the quantum mechanical phonon scattering processes. It therefore could provide currently unavailable predictive power to support ongoing and future experimental studies of thermal transport in materials, as well as contributing to the development of new highly efficient materials engineered for desired thermal management applications.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:  The project will provide training for one postdoctoral researcher at Cornell University and one doctoral graduate student at Boston College.  In addition, several undergraduates including those from underrepresented groups will participate through NSF REU programs at both the Boston College and Cornell sites.  The computational tools to be developed during this project will be incorporated into the publicly available computing library of the Cornell Nanoscale Science and Technology Facility (CNF).  The activity will also benefit society by aiding in the development of new materials with desired thermal transport properties. This will facilitate technological breakthroughs that may lead to the next generation of thermoelectric materials, thermal barrier coating materials, and thermal interface materials.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCollaborative Research: Ab Initio Computation of Phonon Thermal Transport in Crystalline and Disordered Materials\n\nWe all learn about the concepts of hot and cold at an early age. If you have ever accidentally grabbed something hot off the stove, then you quickly learned a very memorable lesson in heat transfer.  Thermal conductivity is a measure of how well a material can conduct heat.  Developing new materials with tailored thermal properties is critical for many technological enterprises, ranging from heat conduits to help cool computers to thermoelectrics that convert waste heat energy into electricity. \n\nIn non-metals, heat is carried primarily by lattice vibrations or phonons.   While we have known about phonons for a long time, predicting the thermal conductivity of a material accurately has remained a challenging problem.  Until very recently, researchers were forced to rely on models that had several adjustable parameters.  Since these empirical models had to be fitted for each material, this limited their predictive capability. The major impediment to a full first principles (no fitting required) approach to calculating thermal conductivity has been determining the anharmonic force constants of a material.  These anharmonic force constants are needed to calculate phonon-phonon scattering and the phonon relaxation time.  In this project, we have developed a density functional approach to calculate the anharmonic force constants which can then be used in a Boltzmann transport equation to predict thermal conductivity.  We have applied this new approach to a range of materials and found good agreement with experiments.  This new technique represents an important predictive tool that can aid in understanding and designing thermal transport in existing and new materials.\n\nDuring this project, we have examined several technologically relevant materials.\n\n(1) Diamond nanowires hold great promise as electron field emission devices and nanoscale heat conduits.  Using our new approach, we investigated how the thermal conductivity of diamond nanowires changes as a function of diameter and crystallographic orientation.  We find that the nanowire thermal conductivity depends strongly on the crystallographic orientation of nanowire growth even at room temperature.  We predict that the [001] growth direction will always possess the highest thermal conductivity.  We also find that the size effects due to phonon-surface scattering in diamond nanowires at room temperature are much stronger than in other systems like Si nanowires.  This indicates that diamond nanowires could serve as a perfect system to test existing theories of how surface scattering affects nanoscale thermal transport.  \n\n(2) Thermoelectric materials allow the conversion of heat into electricity and vice versa.  They have been used to power deep space probes, cool electronics, and scavenge electricity from waste heat.  An efficient thermoelectric material must have high electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity.  This combination is difficult to find in nature and a great deal of research is underway to design improved thermoelectrics.  In this project, we have explored ways to reduce the thermal conductivity of thermoelectrics through alloying and nanostructuring.  We examined Mg2SixSn1-x alloys which show promise as good non-toxic, earth-abundant thermoelectrics.  We calculated the thermal conductivity of Mg2SixSn1-x over the full composition range and found good agreement with experiment.  This work demonstrated that our first principle approach can successfully predict the thermal conductivity of alloys.  We also found that the thermal conductivity of a 20 nm Mg2Si0.6Sn0.4 nanowire is 20% less than the bulk alloy.  This indicates that nanostructuring could be used to make more efficient thermoelectrics.    \n\n(3) Higher manganese silicides (HMS) are a promising class of non-toxic, earth abundant thermoelectrics.  Their low therma..."
