 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research project is to study behavior of solutions to the equations of incompressible fluid motion with very weak initial data.  The following two important open problems in mathematical fluid mechanics will be investigated.  The first is the regularity of solutions to the incompressible fluid equations with initial velocity in critical Sobolev and Besov spaces.  The second is the behavior of solutions to the fluid equations with initial vorticity in the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation. We will also study the approximation of inviscid fluids by fluids of very small viscosity in these two settings.  While much of this research will address two-dimensional flows, extensions of two-dimensional results to the three-dimensional axisymmetric setting will also be considered. \r\n \r\nLow viscosity fluids and fluids in which viscosity is negligible are of great interest to scientists and engineers.  A goal of this research project is to better understand how well an inviscid fluid must behave in order to be reasonably approximated by fluids of small viscosity.  Moreover, this project aims to study the assumptions necessary on both viscous and inviscid flows to extend two-dimensional analysis to a more complicated three-dimensional setting where the flow is symmetric about an axis.  Any improvement in the understanding of these two areas of fluid mechanics will lead to more accurate numerical simulations of badly behaved fluids.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBroadly speaking, the goal of this project was to better understand properties of solutions to the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations.  The Navier-Stokes equations are used to model behavior of viscous fluids as time evolves, while the Euler equations model behavior of fluids which are inviscid, or have no viscosity. \n\nOne objective of this project was to investigate conditions under which two-dimensional inviscid fluid flow can be approximated by fluid flows with small viscosity.  As a result of her research, the principal investigator showed that this approximation can be achieved if the velocity and vorticity (the rotation of the fluid) are sufficiently well-behaved.  The approximation established by the principal investigator is uniform in the sense that the difference between the velocity corresponding to the inviscid fluid and the velocity corresponding to the viscous fluid will be uniformly small across all points in space, assuming viscosity is small.  This result extends the class of solutions of the Euler equations which can be approximated by solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with small viscosity.      \n\nAnother objective of this project was to improve the understanding of behavior of two-dimensional inviscid fluid flow as time evolves.  The principal investigator was able to show that if, initially, the velocity increases sufficiently slowly as we move away from the designated origin in space, then the velocity cannot increase at a faster rate at later times.  This result broadens the class of velocities modeling inviscid fluid flow which, in some sense, maintain their behavior as time evolves.  It also builds upon results in an active area of research in which mathematicians are investigating fluids whose velocity does not become small far away from the origin in space.  \n\nFinally, an objective of this project was to develop a better understanding of three-dimensional axisymmetric flows.  These flows possess a certain symmetry which gives them a two-dimensional structure, even though they live in three-dimensional space.  This structure is beneficial because two-dimensional fluids possess properties which make them much easier to study than three-dimensional fluids.   Indeed, as a result of their axisymmetric structure, many properties of two-dimensional fluids extend to three-dimensional axisymmetric flows.  In recent years, mathematicians have investigated conditions under which behavior of two-dimensional fluid flow extends to the three-dimensional axisymmetric setting.  In this project, the principal investigator showed that properties of certain two-dimensional fluid flows with very badly behaved vorticity are shared by three-dimensional axisymmetric fluid flows.  \n\nAs mentioned above, a primary goal of this project was to better understand behavior of solutions to the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations modeling viscous and inviscid fluid flow, respectively.  In addition to doing research on these topics, the principal investigator had several opportunities to teach graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and faculty about these equations.  For example, she designed an introductory graduate course on fluid mechanics at Oregon State University.  In this course, the students learned a wide variety of topics which put them in position to do research in this field.  In addition, the principal investigator presented the research outlined above in seminars at Oregon State and the University of Oregon, and she gave presentations at several conferences.  Many of these presentations were accessible to graduate students.  Finally, the principal investigator advised a Masters student on topics related to those in this research project. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elaine Cozzi"
