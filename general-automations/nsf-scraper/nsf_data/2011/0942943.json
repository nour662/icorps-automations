 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nThis project is continuing to develop a 4-semester inquiry-based integrated natural science curriculum for all pre-service elementary education majors at the University of Texas.  It is supporting the remaining development of that curriculum, focusing on astronomy and earth climate.  This 4-semester model has built on existing models of integrated natural science content courses and, as such, represents a refinement of past models.  The curriculum is purposefully interdisciplinary and provides a special emphasis on making connections between the disciplines by using common vocabulary, evidence supported reasoning, and scientific laws while studying the phenomena of the natural world.  A stand-out feature of this refinement is the extensive use of formative assessment.  The curriculum includes frequent testing of the pre-service students' mastery of content.  It also includes frequent testing of their self-efficacy in conducting scientific experiments or hands-on activities with K-12 students.  This testing is guided by current research on using formative assessment during inquiry activities and aims to teach pre-service teachers how to use formative assessment in their classrooms.  \r\n\r\nThis project is also supporting faculty training to prepare instructors for offering the necessary multiple sections of these inquiry-based courses.  The new curriculum uses the guided inquiry method as the primary form of instruction.  This is a teaching approach not frequently employed in service courses at large universities.  Nevertheless, hands-on, inquiry-based instruction is the model that should ultimately be employed by in-service teachers.  This curriculum will initially serve 400 pre-service elementary teachers at the University of Texas each year.",
