The proposed work will provide fundamental information for understanding the dual behavior of droplets, underlying science of unique transport mechanisms at the interfacial boundaries (liquid-liquid, liquid-air, liquid-solid), practical tool kits for droplet-based chemical experiments, methodology for optical diagnostics of miniaturized devices and systems, and novel experimental protocols for controlled chemical reactions.\r\nThe broader impacts are summarized as (a) wide applicability of our technology for handling liquid samples in a self-confined configuration and for the effective thermal management of droplets relevant to many disciplines (b) dissemination of cultivated knowledge to research communities across electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry and biology and (c) long-lasting educational outcomes from thoughtfully designed multidisciplinary mentorship and outreach activities involving undergraduate, graduate and K-12 students.  \r\nThis program is built upon a new and transformative discovery ? bidirectional droplet actuation based on the surface film deformation, unlike the traditional approach. This program will help understand the defining science and working principles so the newly proposed actuation mechanism may be favorably used for miniaturized devices and systems.",

The findings in this fundamental study can be beneficial to many applications that need to deal with a small amount of chemical and biological liquid samples. The project successfully demonstrated the applicability of the theoretical framework to the practical aspects of chemical and biological sensing. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/08/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hyoung Jin Cho"
