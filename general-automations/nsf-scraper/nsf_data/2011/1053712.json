 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program, in the CBET division within the Engineering directorate, and the Networks and Regulation Cluster within the MCB division within Biology directorate at NSF, will create new computational tools that can be widely used to enhance the understanding of bacteria that are important in biotechnology and the environment.  Even though a thousand microbial genomes have been sequenced many of these sequenced organisms have not been well characterized experimentally. However, the information in these genome sequences can be used to generate computational models of metabolism and transcriptional regulation. The goals of this project are to use such models to design experiments that improve the understanding of metabolism and regulation in these less characterized organisms. By combining computational and experimental approaches the PI will elucidate the metabolic and transcriptional regulatory networks in two strains of Shewanella (bacteria with environmental and biotechnology applications). The results from this project will be an improved understanding of metabolism and regulation in these bacteria and a collection of computational tools for experimental design and model refinement that can be broadly applied to other sequenced organisms. Undergraduate students will participate in both computational and experimental research activities as part of this project. On-line course materials and pre-conference workshops will be developed related to these research activities to educate undergraduate and graduate students at UW-Madison and other institutions. In addition, workshops and events will be organized for female K-12 and graduate students to learn more about careers in science, engineering and academia.",

This knowledge is critical if we want to alter their behavior?e.g., to improve chemical production or bioremediation. Computational approaches that facilitate experimental design, data analysis, hypothesis generation, and computational model refinement are needed so that we can rapidly build predictive models of these less-characterized microbes, increase our understanding of their metabolic and regulatory networks, and improve our ability to predict and engineer microbial behavior. This project developed computational models of less-characterized microbes and innovative approaches to (1) design experiments to test metabolic and transcriptional regulatory models and (2) identify model changes needed to reduce the number of inconsistencies between model predictions and experimental data. The approaches generated by this project will lead to more complete and accurate models for a number of different microbes and enhance the use of microbes in a variety of applications.</p>\n<p>This project developed metabolic and thermodynamic models for strains of <em>Shewanella, Syntrophobacter, </em>and <em>Methanospirillum </em>? microbes with bioremediation and/or biotechnology applications. We built models for different <em>Shewanella</em> strains and identified conserved and variable metabolic capabilities across the genus (Figure 1). We constructed thermodynamic metabolic models of <em>Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans </em>and <em>Methanospirillum hungatei</em> to investigate how thermodynamics constrains the metabolic behavior of these microbes in mono- and co-cultures.<em> </em>We developed computational algorithms to design conditions where a reaction (Figure 2) or metabolite is essential for growth, which were then used to identify new metabolic functions for genes in an organism (Figure 3). We developed approaches for analyzing gene essentiality data to infer essential biomass components (Figure 4) and metabolite concentration ratios. We also developed algorithms to consider multiple criteria for metabolic engineering strain design and to trace active or high-flux paths through metabolic networks. This pathtracing approach was subsequently used to identify common precursors of different commercial chemical products.
