Specifically, this work will develop an algorithm to calculate simulated magnetic perturbations at the ground based on modeled currents, compare results from the simulation with ground-based magnetometer network data and electric field data from the AMPERE satellite network, and characterize the spatial and temporal evolution of storm-time current systems based on idealized simulations.   Specific science questions address the relationship between neutral thermospheric wind effects, storm phase, and global distribution of magnetic perturbations.",
