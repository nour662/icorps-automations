 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the properties of electro-mechanical waves that propagate as frequency and voltage disturbances over the electrical grid.  These waves reveal much about the short-term dynamics and stability of the electrical grid and will become increasingly important in the future as time-intermittent renewable generation resources are incorporated into the grid.  The approach is to leverage the new, wide-area, high-resolution phasor measurement unit monitoring and apply methods and approaches from the fields of nonlinear systems, applied mathematics, statistical physics, and signal analysis to study the dynamics of voltage, power flow, and frequency disturbances on large-scale transmission grids. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Studying electro-mechanical wave phenomena in large power systems is a promising new approach that draws on numerous disciplines and will rapidly advance the frontiers of the physics-based understanding and data-driven inference of electrical grid states and fast dynamics. This new understanding will enable the design of smart grid controls to prevent economically-costly cascading grid failures. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  New time-intermittent renewable resources create a need for effective ways of discovering how an event in one location is manifested in the rest of the grid.  Electro-mechanical waves provide one such relationship and will be key to early detection of problematic grid behavior and design and activation of advanced control systems to restore reliable operation.  Our project will develop a better fundamental understanding of electrical grid behavior, which will ultimately translate into improved operation, better control, and lowered cost.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nModern life depends on the reliable availability of electricity.  For most people in the United States this electricity comes from one of three large, interconnected 60 Hz ac systems &ndash; the Eastern Interconnect covers most of North America east of the Rockies, the Western Interconnect covers much of the western part of the continent, while most of Texas is covered by the third.  In order to keep the lights on the system frequency must remain quite close to 60 Hz.  This is accomplished by continually changing the electric generation to match the changing electric load in each system.  Even though over the course of a day the amount of electric load can vary by more than 100% from an early morning low to a daytime high, these changes usually occur gradually.  Thus automatic control devices and human operators can keep the system balanced.  Hence the systems appear to be operating in near to some steady-state, and the electrical frequency at every location in the system is almost identical, approximately 60 Hz. \n\nHowever, sometimes unplanned events can occur that can cause substantial deviations in the interconnected system frequency.  An example might be the disconnection of some large generator(s).  During such an event the electrical frequency across the interconnect is not constant.  Rather, the system can have oscillations, in which frequency variations move across the interconnected electric grid at speeds that can be greater than 1000 miles per second.  Usually these frequency oscillations are positively damped with automatic control devices returning the system to near steady-steady within a minute or so.  However during certain operating conditions these oscillations are not damped and can grow with time resulting in potentially large-scale system blackouts.  An example of such a blackout occurred in the Western Interconnect in 1996.  Large oscillations had also occurred in the Eastern Interconnect during the August 14th 2003 blackout that affected 50 million people. \n\nThe goal of this research was to develop better techniques for understanding and modeling these oscillations to track the system trajectory, with the desired outcome of reducing the risk of leading to such large-scale blackouts.  A data-driven model-augmented approach was used.  For this work the data input was assumed to be from phasor measurement units (PMUs), devices that measure the system frequency (and other electric values) at rates of 30 or 60 times per second.  By assuming a set of PMUs spread through an interconnected system we were able to apply modal identification algorithms to obtain information about the oscillation frequencies, their damping ratios, and their respective amplitudes and phases. Identifying poorly damped modes can help in developing control tuning strategies for better system operation.  In particular we explored the application of newer methods such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD).  DMD is a fairly recent analysis method developed in the field of fluid dynamics and computer vision. The research demonstrated how DMD could be used effectively to do real-time analysis of power systems.  To enhance mode detection for future wide-area control schemes, an approach was also developed to identify power system zones for succinct monitoring of key points in a network.   The use of interruptible load to improve the power system frequency response was also considered, with a new algorithm developed to better utilize these resources.  Finally, we considered better methods to visualize the results.  The net benefit of this research is expected to improve understanding of power system oscillations, coupled with better techniques for real-time monitoring that could allow better usage of our nation\u00c6s electric grids, and reducing the risk of large-scale blackouts.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/09/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas Overbye"
