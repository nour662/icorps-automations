 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California-Irvine, lead instituion for the University of California System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP), a senior alliance, will continue to conduct recruitment and retention activities over the next five years to produce highly competitive students from historically underrepresented minority populations, mostly Hispanic-Americans, in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) for the 21st Century workforce.  The University of California-Merced joins eight other UC campuses (Berkeley, Davis, Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Irvine, Riverside and San Diego)in implementing successful practices such as peer-mentoring, faculty mentored research, collaborative learning, undergraduate national and international research to increase STEM degree production.  This alliance of institutions will continue linkages with California community colleges to increase student transfer rates to 4-year baccalaureate-producing institutions.  Planned activities to stimulate community college transfer include annual \"STEM Transfer Days\", partnerships with the Alliance for Regional Collaboration to Heighten Educational Success (ARCHES), MESA, and other federal, state and local educational organizations devoted to supporting pre-college and undergraduate education.   \r\n\r\nCAMP provides the tools and support for minority students to overcome traditional barriers. With a common vision and collective effort, CAMP has become the University's premier systemwide program to raise academic performance and full participation in university life. Academic socialization together with professionalization is embedded in all student development activities from entering freshmen to enrollment in graduate education. Faculty mentored laboratory research is a key component, resulting in increased student connectivity to the discipline, subject mastery, and a strong propensity to prepare for graduate school, particularly the Ph.D.\r\n\r\nInstitutional commitment to increase the quality and quantity of underrepresented minorities completing programs in STEM will continue.  The University of California LSAMP has sustained a 2:1 ratio of support to NSF funding, representing an unparalleled effort for institutionalization.\r\n\r\nCAMP's effectiveness stems from connectivity among partners and significant, sustained commitment of STEM deans, faculty, and program staff, supported by the University's top-level leadership. From baseline year  the minority STEM baccalaureate degree completion rate has increased 168% and minority STEM enrollment increased 182%. CAMP has played a strong role in these outcomes. The Alliance has fostered local, regional, and national synergistic relationships that enable an effective infrastructure within California higher education and among LSAMP-funded institutions nationwide.",

Over the past five years we have seen the results of a positive and supportive campus environment at our 9 UC partners that make a difference in student achievement, not only in degree completion but in retention rates. While there are many individual success stories, we are particularly proud that CAMP students have achieved a national identify and a vibrant student peer network and a national sense of community.</p>\n<p>GROUP IMPACT</p>\n<p>The University of California LSAMP impact is evident in systemwide enrollment of historically underrepresented students, with 23,973 URM STEM majors enrolled at UC partner campuses in 2018-19, an all-time high. Over the life of the CAMP/LSAMP program, partners working collaboratively have helped achieve a 591% increase in degree production systemwide, including 4,250 B.S. degrees awarded in 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2016-17 including Fall 2017, 384 CAMP students conducted laboratory research; 160 presented at national STEM conferences, and 37 won national recognition for excellence in research.&nbsp;&nbsp;Faculty mentoring has shown to be the Alliance's exemplary strength impacting student commitment and retention in STEM majors. Undergraduate engagement in laboratory research has proven to be a life-changing experience that provides students with hard skills and competencies in technologies and develops soft skills such as independence and communications proficiency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>INTELLECTUAL MERIT</p>\n<p>The University of California provides an exciting, competitive environment for developing intellectual growth and creative activity in STEM. High quality discipline-based opportunities to participate in the scientific community, especially laboratory research, will continue to support CAMP students systemwide. The program will expose students to extraordinary experiences in the national labs as well as university research institutes and creative centers fostering innovative ideas in STEM. Participants engage in cutting edge scientific and engineering discovery through challenging mentored research, and develop communication skills by presenting their findings at national conferences. The benefit of working with faculty, senior scientists, graduate students, and postdocs posits students to gain necessary technological and analytical skills that support career development. With its dedicated leadership and focus on LSAMP goals, CAMP demonstrates high levels of&nbsp;&nbsp;impacting academic performance, inclusive excellence, and increased enrollment in graduate education.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>BROADER IMPACTS</p>\n<p>The interaction with UC faculty members and scientists through laboratory research experiences builds knowledge in the discipline and broadens enrollment in graduate school and STEM careers, particularly emerging interdisciplinary fields. Embedded in all core components is the overarching objective to narrow disparities and lift achievement for underrepresented minorities, which is seen in the increasing numbers of students enrolling in graduate education. CAMP fulfills the student outreach component for the broader impacts requirement of faculty proposals for federal, state, and foundation grants, with potential for students to experience advanced and original experimentation. Community college partnerships for transfer success further expand opportunity for minority students to transition smoothly to the UC and engage in research. The companion Bridge to the Doctorate activity, which rotates among our UC partners, is a dynamic extension of the work that is broadening participation in the professoriate, R&amp;D, and the STEM professional community. Benefits to society will be seen in multiple areas, particularly breakthrough technologies, artificial intelligence, societal implications of ubiquitous IT, and cyber security/national security; project management, statistical software development and global economics; science policy advising at the national level; robotics for manufacturing and targeted health systems. Findings resulting from our shared goals, multi-contextual elements of the work, and measurable outcomes will be disseminated through various local, state and national venues as well as in webinars and relevant virtual learning environments and printed reports.</p>\n<p>Among our significant outcomes is participant tracking along the degree pathway.&nbsp;&nbsp;LSAMP tracking is both decentralized, at the partner campuses who track student progress, and centralized at Irvine, in the Statewide Office, under the program evaluator. Monitoring student progress has been a core activity in measuring success. Technology is the primary tool for tracking student participation and progress. Tracking of each graduating class is assisted by the online Senior Exit Survey, in which students relate their post baccalaureate plans for graduate education or the professional workplace.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/24/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Howard&nbsp;Gillman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1102531/1102531_10105222_1554338431735_UCCAMPExcellenceinResearchawards--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1102531/1102531_10105222_1554338431735_UCCAMPExcellenceinResearchawards--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UC CAMP Excellence in Research Awards\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1102531/1102531_10105222_1554338431735_UCCAMPExcellenceinResearchawards--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UC CAMP Excellence in Research Awards\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CAMP students receiving the UC CAMP Excellence in Research Awards at the 2018 Undergraduate Research Symposium</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jacqueline Le Photography</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Howard&nbsp;Gillman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UC CAMP Excellence in Research Awards</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1102531/1102531_10105222_1554337684616_LSAMPUNDERGRADPRESENTER--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1102531/1102531_10105222_1554337684616_LSAMPUNDERGRADPRESENTER--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"LSAMP Undergraduate Presenter\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1102531/1102531_10105222_1554337684616_LSAMPUNDERGRADPRESENTER--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"LSAMP Undergraduate Presenter\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CAMP student presenting her research at 2018 StatewideUndergraduate Research Symposium</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jacqueline Le Photography</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Howard&nbsp;Gillman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LSAMP Undergraduate Presenter</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1102531/1102531_10105222_1554337936819_STATEWIDESYMPOSIUM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1102531/1102531_10105222_1554337936819_STATEWIDESYMPOSIUM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"LSAMP Undergraduate Presenter\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1102531/1102531_10105222_1554337936819_STATEWIDESYMPOSIUM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"LSAMP Undergraduate Presenter\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UCSC CAMP student presenting at 2018 Undergraduate Research Symposium</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jacqueline Le Photography</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Howard&nbsp;Gillman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LSAMP Undergraduate Presenter</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1102531/1102531_10105222_1554337599323_LSAMPPRESENTERS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1102531/1102531_10105222_1554337599323_LSAMPPRESENTERS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"LSAMP Presenters\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1102531/1102531_10105222_1554337599323_LSAMPPRESENTERS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"LSAMP Presenters\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UCSD CAMP student presenters at 2018 StatewideUndergraduate Research Symposium</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jacqueline Le Photography</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Howard&nbsp;Gillman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LSAMP Presenters</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
