 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposer proposes to develop efficient numerical methods\r\nfor several problems in quantum dynamics. Specifically, the following\r\nthree topics are selected:  Semiclassical methods for quantumscattering, \r\nsurface hopping,  and Bloch-decomposition based computational\r\nmethods for quantum dynamics in periodic lattice. These are challenging\r\ncomputational issues that involve high frequency waves and\r\nquantum-classical coupling. Mathematical and computational\r\nmethods can play important roles to enhance our understanding as well\r\nas our ability to simulate these problems.\r\n\r\nThese problems arise in solid state physics,  semiconductor device\r\nmodeling, Bose-Eistein Condensations (BEC),  solar energy, and\r\nfunctional materials such as graphane, thus the developed computational\r\nmethods will have a wide range of applications, some of which of\r\nsignificant national interests. Some of the research results will\r\nprovide excellent additions for future graduate courses in applied\r\nmathematics and scientific computing, thus will help to\r\nimprove the graduate curriculum in applied mathematics in order to\r\nbetter train future graduate students in modern applied mathematics.",
