 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this EAGER award is to develop a new and potentially transformative technology to enable the rapid development of secreted proteases with extended substrate specificity.  These proteases would constitute a new class of therapeutics that could be used to treat certain diseases where overproduction of a protein, or production of a poorly folded protein leads to the disease state.  As evidenced by the therapeutic use of botulinum toxin, the ability to achieve precise specificity towards an arbitrary target would dramatically reduce the production costs of biological theraputics by orders of magnitude, when compared to therapeutic antibodies.  Although a few proteases have proven to be effective therapeutics, their use has been limited because of the inability to engineer proteases with desired specificity.  To address this need, a novel proteases library screening technology will be developed to enable multi step directed evolution of protease specificity.  The technology will be tested in a target application for Alzheimer's disease.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     This project has resulted in advanced training of two graduate doctoral students and two undergraduate students in Chemical Engineering and Chemistry, through mentoring and active learning in a modern biotechnology laboratory.  The primary outcome of this project is a new technology for creating therapeutic enzymes that have great potential for improving the effectiveness of biological therapies, while lowering their cost.\n\n     During the course of this one year project the funded investigators design and developed a method to screen for protease variants that could cleave a target peptide substrate.  Proteases are enzymes that recognize specifically cut other proteins and are ubiquitous in living organisms.   Proteases are the only available means to cut and thereby modify the linear sequence of a protein to alter protein function.  Although several proteases are now used as efficacious therapeutics, their use has been hindered by the lack of available methods to modify their recognition specificity.  Thus, during the course of this EAGER project we designed a novel process to generate proteolytic enzymes that recognize and cut a target sequence of amino acids, but do not cut a non-target sequence.  To accomplish this we genetically modified yeast to produce both a template protease and a substrate whose cleavage state could be detected using high throughput quantitative screening instrumentation.  We identified conditions where substrate cleavage could be quantitatively measured for single cells in a population.  These accomplishments have successfully laid the foundation for a new process to create proteases with desired recognition and cleavage specificity.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick S Daugherty"
