 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the design of green cellular network architectures and algorithms to reduce energy consumption. A major consumer of energy in cellular networks is the operation of the base stations. Most base stations are deployed and operated continuously based on peak traffic estimates. Intuitively, it saves energy to judiciously \"scale back\" un-utilized and under-utilized base stations during off-peak times. The remaining base stations must adapt accordingly so that the required coverage is maintained.\r\n\r\nThe PIs propose a dynamically adaptive cellular network where the cell size and capacity of the base stations are dynamically reconfigured based on the current user locations and Quality of Service (QoS) demands of the applications. Modeling of the network power consumption based on the network topography, followed by optimization of the topography is the key to this problem. The project will involve student participation at all stages through suitably designed projects. The results of the research will be disseminated through professional journals and conference proceedings and also through industry forums and workshops. Furthermore, the project addresses one of the most pressing issues of today, namely, reducing the carbon footprint of the cellular network. Radical new designs for the network have the potential to spur economic development, create jobs and forge stronger communities.",
