The proposed research uses a wide range of techniques including forcing, PCF theory and inner model theory.  \r\n\r\nThe immediate goal of Cummings' research program is to get a better understanding of certain  infinite mathematical structures. Problems about these structures arise in many areas of mathematics including algebra, analysis, topology and (perhaps surprisingly)  the study of finite structures.   The long term goal is to forge new tools for the construction and analysis  of infinite structures, which should  then  find broader application.",
