The discussion will be held between leading cancer researchers and leading physicists working at the interface of biology and physics. The physics community working at the physics-biology interface is excited by the possibility of contributing to the fundamental understanding of cancer, which is a failure of multi-cellularity, but is also an essential byproduct of evolution. The meeting is sponsored by the Physics Division at NSF.",
