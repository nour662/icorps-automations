 "awd_abstract_narration": "1133015\r\nKaragozian\r\n\r\nThis project involves the study of low density non-reactive and reactive (burning) jets injected into crossflow, a topic applicable to improved efficiency and reduced emissions for a range of energy and propulsion systems.  The ability to control the trajectory, spread, mixing, reaction completion, and temperature or density field associated with such jets is the overall goal of these studies.  The present approach is primarily experimental, involving optical diagnostics as a means of interrogating and analyzing the instabilities in the flowfield as a means of developing methods for their control.  This work will help to advance our ability to design and develop highly efficient future engines for stationary power plants, airbreathing propulsion systems, and rocket propulsion systems.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of this research involve detailed explorations of the mechanisms underlying convective to absolute shear layer instability transition for low density non-reactive and reactive transverse jets.  For both equidensity and low density jets in crossflow, there is significant evidence to confirm that the shear layer becomes globally unstable or self-excited; such evidence includes the initiation of strong single-tone disturbances that do not vary along the jet's shear layer, the inhibition of subharmonic initiation, lock-in to applied frequencies only at very large forcing amplitudes and/or at frequencies close to the fundamental, and evidence of a Hopf bifurcation.  We are able to take advantage of the knowledge of these instabilities in applying strategic forcing to the transverse jet, whereby relatively weak sinusoidal jet excitation can enhance the convectively unstable jet, but strong square wave forcing at specific temporal pulse widths is required to control the absolutely unstable transverse jet. Yet the specific mechanisms for this transition, a quantification of altered mixing states during different excitation conditions, and the behavior of transverse jets in the presence of a chemical reaction are all significant unknowns, with substantial practical relevance.\r\n\r\nThese experimental studies employ laser diagnostics, including particle image velocimetry (PIV) simultaneous to planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging of seeded acetone, in order to quantify 3D velocity and vorticity fields as well as scalar transport processes in transverse jets.  Building on these explorations will be quantification of mixing associated with the non-reactive flow (equidensity as well as low density jets) via acetone PLIF, as a means of determining flow and excitation conditions to optimize jet-crossflow mixing.  Closed loop control methods are being developed for the optimization of jet behavior and response to upset conditions, using non-intrusive sensing whose measurements may be related to global flow characteristics.  With respect to the reactive jet in crossflow, OH* chemiluminescence imaging will be used to determine flame characteristics, instabilities, and flow characteristics.  These fundamental explorations will be critical to the ability to predict and control such instabilities in a range of engineering systems.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed studies go well beyond the practical applications of the transverse jet and the usual \"graduate level research and education\".  Our track record in such impacts has included undergraduate research training as well as outreach to and laboratory experiences for local high school students and underrepresented students at other universities.  In the present project, undergraduate researchers will continue to be trained and employed in our laboratory, and outreach presentations and demonstrations will continue to be provided for local high school and potentially middle school and elementary school students, with special focus on students at public schools.  Opportunities for local high school students to gain laboratory experiences in the summer will be provided.  Cutbacks in funding by the state of California to the public schools- MESA (Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement) programs has made it even more important for universities such as UCLA to extend outreach programs to public middle schools and high schools as a means of encouraging the development of future engineers and scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe technical outcomes from this NSF-supported project pertain to an experimental exploration of the behavior of the jet in crossflow (JICF) under conditions where the densities of the jet and crossflow fluids are the same, and also where the jet fluid is of lower density.  These studies are performed in the gas phase, with engineering applications and detailed measurements relevant to non-reactive as well as reactive systems.  This flowfield is found in aircraft engines, where control of instabilities can improve turbine blade cooling, reduce atmospheric pollutants, and improve fuel efficiency.  It is also applicable to rocket engines, where improved mixing in preburners or thrust vectoring can impact performance and safety.  Based on these wide-ranging applications, an understanding of the relationships among flow instabilities, jet structure, mixing, and local fluid mechanical strain rates has profound implications for flow control and optimization in practical systems.  The present experiments have employed non-intrusive laser diagnostics, including particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging of seeded acetone, in order to quantify three-dimensional velocity fields as well as jet structure and scalar transport/mixing/interfacial straining processes.  To our knowledge, this type of extensive exploration of the transverse jet has never been done, especially for such a wide range of operating conditions.  An important new discovery in these studies has involved the nature of jet\u00c6s three-dimensional structure, in particular, the existence of asymmetries that are associated with the jet\u00c6s cross-section in specific flow regimes.  Jet cross-sectional asymmetry appears for flush jet injection at relatively high jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratios, for which shear layers are (relatively weakly) convectively unstable.  But when the flow conditions are such that the jet shear layers experience absolutely unstable conditions, the jet cross-section returns to a classic symmetric counter-rotating vortex pair.  These findings are observed to have significant implications for jet mixing characteristics, where both centerplane-based mixing metrics and cross-sectional metrics are quantified.  The findings are similarly crucial to differences in the local strain rates in the flowfield, with important relevance to ignition processes in reactive flows. \n\n \n\nThe broader impacts of these studies have gone well beyond the practical applications of the jet in crossflow and the usual \"graduate level research and education\".  Our activities have included undergraduate research training as well as outreach and presentations to high school and community college students, many of whom are from under-represented groups.
