 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the work of Professor Brandon L. Ashfeld at the University of Notre Dame toward the design and development of new phosphorus mediated synthetic strategies for the direct conversion of carboxylic acids to ketones.  This research uses an alkyl phosphorus-to-carbon ligand transfer that enables the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds with high levels of chemoselectivity and effectively allows for an operationally simple and efficient approach toward synthetic targets through unconventional bond constructs.  This study expands the role of carboxylic acids and phosphorus reagents in synthesis and introduces new and exciting strategies for complex molecule synthesis.\r\n\r\nThe long term impact of this research program is the development of synthetic strategies that enable the construction of new and complex compounds useful for scientific research pharmaceutical industry.  The educational component of this CAREER award describes a series of outreach initiatives to inspire secondary students to pursue careers in the physical sciences, the development of an undergraduate course in energy sustainability, and the design of an interactive, web-based workbook to serve as a valuable resource for students and educators of chemistry. The combined research and education components constitute the foundation of this training program, and address the fundamental issues of safety, environmental friendliness, energy conservation, and cost of chemical research. Recruitment and training of undergraduate students, women, and under-represented minorities to chemistry, and the physical sciences, is a key aspect of this multi-faceted program.",
