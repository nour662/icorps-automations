Observations will be performed using the Georgia State University (GSU) Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) interferometer, an NSF-supported six-telescope optical array on Mt. Wilson, California.  This group will make use of the Michigan Infrared Combiner (MIRC), a facility instrument built by this group that will be upgraded from 4-beam to 6-beam operation in time for this project.\r\n\r\nThe work is expected to shed light on the relationship between rotation, magnetic fields, and stellar activity in cool stars.  Such phenomena are well-studied on the Sun, but have not been investigated in great detail in other stars.",
