 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraic Combinatorixx is a five-day workshop to be held May 22-27, 2011 at the Banff International Research Station (BIRS) in  Alberta, Canada.  This workshop will bring together forty-two senior and junior female mathematicians to collaborate on cutting-edge research problems in algebraic combinatorics and to forge mentoring networks, with the long-term goal of increasing and strengthening the participation of women in mathematics.  BIRS will provide the necessary facilities for uninterrupted research activities including intense and prolonged interactions for collaborative and cross-disciplinary research among participants.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic combinatorics is a broad discipline with substantial connections to many different areas of mathematics and physics such as knot theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, number theory, mathematical biology, statistical mechanics, and quantum computing.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will also have a major mentoring component.  Over half of the participants will be early career\r\n(pre-tenure or recently tenured) women faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, or graduate students who will be paired with senior researchers working in combinatorics.  In addition to research talks, on two of the evenings there will be discussions on building the tools to succeed:  from professional development\r\nto work-life balance.\r\n\r\nThe long-term benefits of this workshop will be an increase in the participation of women in research activities, the creation and maintenance of a research network of potential collaborators, and visibility and connectivity for younger researchers, especially those at smaller  colleges.",

Of the 25 individuals  supported by this grant, 19 of them were early-career mathematicians. As one participant remarked in her evaluation of the conference: 'This was a unique experience; fully energizing, an eye opening in how a well-planned workshop can be extremely productive.'\n\nThe program for the workshop consisted of survey lectures on the latest research developments  given by more established researchers and some shorter research talks by junior participants.  In addition, early-career participants presented posters and gave a brief 2-3 minute preview of their poster before it was displayed.   Roughly half the time was spent working in smaller groups organized according to research interests, where actual research problems were discussed, and in many cases solved.  Groups gave brief daily updates to the entire workshop audience on the topics and problems they had worked on and posed open questions.   As a result, there was much collaboration and discussion, which have continued well beyond the 5-day workshop.  At the end of the workshop, the groups presented reports.

Funding from this grant supported five research projects during 2012-2013.\n\n To build on the momentum generated at the workshop,  two participants organized a well-attended special session \"Algebraic Combinatorics and Representation Theory\" at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in January 2013.   The session organizers and half  the invited speakers were involved with the 2011 workshop.   The session provided a forum for reporting on recent research developments, for sustaining contacts,  and for expanding the network of researchers.\n\n The response to the Algebraic Combinatorixx Workshop was overwhelmingly positive,  and many participants expressed  interest in attending  similar events in the future.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Georgia Benkart"
