 "awd_abstract_narration": "During magnetic reconnection, the energy stored in magnetic fields is quickly tapped and converted into heat and kinetic energy, in a process analogous to a magnetic explosion. Reconnection is thought to power many astrophysical events including solar flares and Earth's auroras, as well as play an important role in laboratory fusion experiments. Although the basic workings of magnetic reconnection are well-understood, a long-standing puzzle has existed as to the precise process that provides the spark triggering the explosion. Advances in computer power have recently made it possible to model magnetic reconnection in three dimensions and allow this work to answer the question.\r\n\r\nBy tapping the energy of magnetic fields, reconnection in the solar corona and solar wind drives space weather, the changing of environmental conditions in near-Earth space. Space weather, in turn, has profound influences on topics as diverse as passenger radiation exposure on polar flights, communications satellite lifetimes, and the stability of electrical power grids. Exploring the dynamics of reconnection and, in particular, understanding the processes that allow reconnection to occur thus has broad importance for society.",

Since laboratory\nexperiments and in situ satellite observations of reconnection are\ndifficult (although it is the focus of NASA's upcoming Magnetospheric\nMultiscale Mission), computer simulations offer a complementary\napproach.  The most physically accurate formulations require massive\namounts of computational power and only with recent supercomputers has\nit become possible to compute physically accurate models in three\ndimensions.  The primary goal of this project was to understand, via\nnumerical simulations, the mechanisms responsible for sparking\nmagnetic reconnection.  Answering this question would further our\nknowledge of this fundamental process.  Future work, e.g., global\nsimulations of space weather, can incorporate the findings which would\nallow for better predictions and protection against adverse events.\n\nReconnection occurs in what are known as plasmas, collections of\ncharged particles, usually protons and electrons, in which a magnetic\nfield is embedded. Work for this project has found that during\nreconnection (and particularly during a quite common type known as\nguide-field reconnection), thin regions of current can form, become\nunstable, and evolve into turbulence.  A phenomenon known as anomalous\nviscosity (an electromagnetic analogue of the usual fluid viscosity)\nbecomes important in such turbulent regions and the simulations and\nanalysis we have performed show that it is the dominant mechanism\ntriggering reconnection over a broad range of parameters.  The\naccompanying image shows results from one of the simulations.\nOppositely-directed magnetic field lines (red, orange, and white)\nreconnect at the central current layer.  Numerous flux ropes (seen in\nthe isosurfaces as red on the ends with a tan exterior) twist around\nand interact with each other in a turbulent manner.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael M Swisdak"
