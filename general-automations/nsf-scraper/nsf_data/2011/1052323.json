 "awd_abstract_narration": "What is the effect of a mutation that \"knocks out\" a single gene in an organism's genome? Unsatisfyingly, today's plant geneticists can only say: \"It depends.\" Only a small minority of mutations are lethal or have a significant impact. For the vast majority, at most only subtle effects have been detected. Plant genetics is poised to progress rapidly in remedying this situation, using a collection of \"knockout\" mutant strains of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Knockouts, carrying a tiny tagged segment of disruptive DNA in one targeted gene, are already available for ~67% of the 27,000+ unique genes in this plant's genome. Inspired by progress in yeast genetics, the project will grow large subsets of these knockouts in benign and challenging environments, quantifying ecological performance attributes (e.g., population growth rate, fruit yield). We predict that, as in yeast, such an approach will reveal important phenotypic differences between mutant and control lines and possibly reveal undiscovered genome-wide patterns. The project is a collaboration of primarily undergraduate institutions and will train young scientists in how major genomic questions are addressed by networks of researchers. \r\n\r\nThe project will involve screening 7000 available T-DNA lines to identify those that have mutations at only one gene, providing these results to the biological community.  Traits relevant to plant performance will be measured in over 3000 single-mutant lines, across multiple environments. Cyberinfrastructure will be developed to disseminate common protocols and to archive and index data.    Over 50 undergraduate researchers will be involved in collecting and analyzing data and communicating results. The project also includes a study of how participating in a distributed research network influences undergraduates' access to social capital within the scientific community. Results from this aspect of the work will lay the foundation for a larger scale, empirical study of the outcomes undergraduates realize by participating in research networks.",

Our project is now dubbed &ldquo;Undergraduates Phenotyping <em>Arabidopsis</em>&nbsp;Knockouts&rdquo; or &ldquo;UnPAK&rdquo; for short.

Our focus on these traits was motivated by their relevance to agriculture as well as to organismal fitness. Additionally, we concentrated all of our efforts on a comprehensive mutant collection consisting of thousands of mutant lines, previous developed and made publicly available by the SALK Institute. Distinct from prior efforts sampling one or a few SALK knockout mutants at a time, our experiments involved mass sampling, aiming to cover a large and representative sample of the 27,000+ genes in the Arabidopsis genome. We typically grew 122 or 366 mutants per experiment, completing multiple experiments and accumulating data for more than a thousand mutant lines on our campus alone. Additionally, we created and refined protocols to quantify and analyze trait data in a standardized manner, and shared protocols and preliminary data analyses using Internet-based tools. Barnard also collaborated with College of Charleston to conduct a large capstone experiment, re-screening a subset of mutants in a soil-manipulation experiment to quantify when shifts in one or more traits were dependent not only on a specific mutation but additionally on one or more soil-mediated environmental stresses. Data from Barnard and from all participating UnPAK campuses was amassed by uploading to the public UnPAK database developed at the College of Charleston during this grant.
