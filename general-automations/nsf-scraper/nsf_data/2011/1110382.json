 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do females pick a mate? Do social interactions modify innate preferences? Understanding how genes and social environment interact to produce mating patterns is important for understanding how the spectacular diversity in animal morphology evolves and is maintained. This proposed work aims to determine whether social interactions and visual and olfactory communication  are associated with the maintenance of animal morphological diversity by determining whether mate preferences for physical appearances can be learned and mediated by the presence of olfactory signals in one of the most diverse groups of animals: butterflies. Having determined that females can learn to like specific male physical appearances, the chemical signals of male butterflies will be modified to 1) determine whether female innate preferences for male odors facilitate female learning preferences for physical appearance, and 2) determine whether females can learn preferences for specific male odors. Male-male interactions during female mate choice trials will also be observed to determine how male-male competition mediates female preference. This will be the first study examining 1) the role of pre-mating female experience on the relative importance of male appearance and odor in any animal; and 2) the combinatorial role of male activity and male appearance in non-vertebrates, illuminating how social interactions and multiple signals influence mating patterns and drive the evolution of diverse animal forms.\r\nThis research will train an undergraduate researcher, and will be used to engage non-science majors in scientific thought processes during mentoring sessions and social interactions via the graduate affiliate program at an undergraduate dorm. Findings from this project will be displayed on a public website on the biology of Bicyclus anynana, in the form of reader-friendly multi-media web-pages accessible to high-school students, the public at large and the scientific community.",

Future work in this, and other systems, will allow us to explore these differences in perception, and to determine whether this difference in visual perception is pervasive amongst animals as well as why these sex-specific differences in response to visual social signals exist. Our finding that odor influences whether females learn to prefer or avoid specific male wing patterns demonstrates, for the first time, that signals in other sensory modalities (such as odor) influence the learning of visual mate preferences. This finding gives us new insights in to how visual preferences for physical traits may be learned.\n \nIn addition to enhancing our understanding of how visual social learning works by producing the first evidence of learning biases in visual preference learning, the first evidence of differences between male and female learning biases in visual preference learning, and the first evidence that odor influences whether females learn to prefer or avoid male visual characteristics, this grant assisted in funding both the training of undergraduate women and minorities in the sciences, and outreach activities to engage the public in the sciences. Two undergraduate students, who were either female or ethnic minorities, were trained in scientific methodology, data collection, and data analysis during this study. W..."
