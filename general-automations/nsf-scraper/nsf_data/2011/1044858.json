 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is re-designing biochemistry laboratory courses, from the traditional structured experiments based on laboratory manuals to a more exploratory, project-based approach. To that end, this project is (i) designing a year-long, research-based biochemistry laboratory course for immediate implementation, (ii) developing the course as a series of individual units, or modules, which can be easily transferred to other institutions, and (iii) developing and publishing a website that disseminates the infrastructure to others interested in improving their undergraduate biochemistry programs. The long-term educational goal is to enhance the scientific education of undergraduate students, and to provide other biochemistry educators with a framework by which they can transform their own programs, thereby having a broader impact on the quality of education of biochemistry students. The goal is to educate scientists, not science majors.\r\nThe educational materials and resources developed are available to other educators and institutions via a website. The work is also being disseminated via publication in appropriate educational journals, and via presentations at regional and national meetings which biochemistry educators attend.",
