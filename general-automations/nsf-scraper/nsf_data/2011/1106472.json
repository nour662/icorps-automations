 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past, speech research training was only available to students and researchers associated with major research universities and large centers where dedicated software development was joined with mentoring and expert technical support. In the current environment, inexpensive computers, electronic distance communication, and specialist freeware, have expanded the opportunities for dissemination of research and knowledge outside of such large centers. On the one hand, this is an exciting development, because it reduces barriers to entry for a wider and more diverse set of students and researchers. On the other, hand, the laboratory software for visualizing and manipulating acoustic signals is either prohibitively expensive for institutions to buy, or else discouragingly inefficient for students at introductory levels. Other software is easy to use but doesn't teach the fundamental scientific principles that underlie the manipulations allowed.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet this opportunity for expanded access, this award supports a conference workshop, \"Software To Empower Learning And Research In Speech (STELARIS),\" for scientists, students and software developers. The theme of the workshop is to identify the best existing platforms and develop standards for future developments that minimize technical barriers to data exchange, while maximizing use as a teaching and research tool.",

There were 41 senior researcher attendees and 10 student attendees. It was generally agreed that the most important need was a method or methods for researchers to learn about available tools and databases of speech recordings.  Subgroups shared information on which tools are available where, and also on websites that might be available for hosting standard versions of such tools for download.   The group agreed on two steps for the future:\n\n(1)     Organization of a special session at the Interspeech on whether such a database is feasible and if so, what is the best way to set up such a database    This suggestion is being implemented currently. \n\n(2)     Identification of a website and plans for hosting/maintenance. \n\nPerhaps the most important and visible outcome of the workshop is that, as partial implementation of (2) above, the student section of the International Speech Communication Association (ISCA), is now hosting a website for uploading of useful software and speech data for teaching and research.  The URL for the website is:   http://isca-students.org/?q=node%2Fadd%2Fspeech-tool&amp;mid=53713.  This database became available in late November, 2011.
