 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 2009 the U.S. Federal government provided nearly $33 billion in funding for university performed research and development (R&D), accounting for about 60 percent of the total funding for university R&D in that year.  This project examines the impact of this federal funding for university R&D in chemistry on a range of significant economic and scientific outcomes, including the production of new scientific knowledge and how this knowledge in turn affects local economies. \r\n\r\nThe project uses a two-track research strategy to shed light on the impacts of federal funding on scientific productivity and local economic development.  In the first track, we analyze historical data on research funding at the 150 most-funded institutions using a dynamic panel estimation framework.  We measure scientific outcomes via the number of doctoral students trained, the quantity of publications produced, the scholarly impact of these publications as reflected in the number of citations they receive, and the number of patents awarded; economic outcomes are measured using average wage levels in the community surrounding each institution.  The significant policy-induced variations in research funding over the last two decades are exploited as a natural experiment to obtain causal estimates of the marginal impact of increased funding on these different measures of impact.\r\n\r\nIn the second track, survey data will be collected from investigators in chemistry departments at the institutions being studied to gain insight about the ways in which institutional characteristics, attitudes and behaviors mediate the effects of federal funding.   Combining this survey data from research chemists with the overall analysis of spending impact from the first track will yield insights specific to the effects of chemical-science investments that can then be compared to the impacts of non-chemistry spending.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe project will develop quantitative measures of the impact of federal funding on scientific and economic outcomes and connect them to different institutional characteristics at the universities studied.  Estimates of these impacts can be used to identify specific institutional characteristics that either increase or reduce the impact of additional funding, and thereby evaluate the most (and least) productive areas for incremental funding.  For federal officials involved in setting science policy and allocating scarce taxpayer funds, these estimates will help support choices that maximize the scientific impact of their investments.  For university officials administering these research institutions, these estimates will allow them to better understand how institutional policies affect desired institutional outcomes and consequently support their ability to make better choices about institutional priorities.",

We also measured the inputs of number of faculty, graduate students, and research funding in chemistry. To measure innovations resulting from Chemistry research we analyzed data from the US Patent and Trademark Office on patents assigned to universities.  Using these data required us to resolve ambiguities in the assignee information in the original source and match them to individual research universities.\n\n \n\nIn addition to the quantitative database described above, we surveyed the membership of the American Chemical Society, asking questions about the impact of funding cuts and additional funding on the quality and quantity of their research.  When fielding this survey took advantage of the opportunity to explore how small incentives affect survey response among professionals.\n\n \n\nOur research has identified several important insights about the relationship between federal funding and chemistry research.  We published Rosenbloom, Ginther, Juhl and Heppert (2015) that found a strong, positive causal effect of federal funding on knowledge production. This effect is similar across subsets of universities, suggesting a relatively efficient allocation of R&amp;D funds. We also documented a rapid acceleration in the rate at which chemical knowledge was produced in the late 1990s and early 2000s relative to the financial and human resources devoted to its production (Figure 1).  In fact, we identified a declining \"cost per publication\" in chemistry research that is at odds with trends for STEM fields as a whole where \"costs per publication\" actually increased. \n\n \n\nIn subsequent work, we have also shown that chemistry patents per research dollar have increased over time.  Furthermore, our preliminary estimates indicate that increases in the number of postdocs at a university lead to higher levels of future university chemistry funding.  We expect that these findings will result in one or two additional research publications. \n\n \n\nWe are currently in the process of analyzing the survey of American Chemical Society members.  The survey solicited responses to the following research questions:\n\n \n\nHow lower than normal funding affects choice of research topic \nHow inadequate funding in the past five years affected his/her research program \nHow the source of funding affects the quantity of products \nHow the source of funding affects the quality of products \n\n\nTable 1 summarizes the responses in the case of lower than normal research funding.  Our survey respondents indicated that they would engage in less risky and incremental research and would spend less money on research personnel such as graduate students and postdocs. \n\n \n\nWhile fielding the survey of American Chemical Society members, we experimented with different financial incentives to determine which approaches would increase response rates.  We have developed a manuscript with the graduate research assistant employed on this project.  Respondents were offered $10 and $5 prepaid debit cards, the opportunity to participate in the lottery with an expected payoff of $5 and a $5 donation to the charity for completion of the survey.  Response rates are compared among groups of respondents with different incentives to those that were not offered any compensation for survey participation.  We find that cash incentives increased the probability of response compared no incentives, but lottery and charity donations did not influence the response rate. We also found that compared to charity, respondents requested fewer incentives in all other groups, including cash incentives and..."
