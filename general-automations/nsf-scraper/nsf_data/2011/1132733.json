Specifically, the project supports travel to the conference for those who might not otherwise be able to attend for financial reasons, and  participation in a doctoral consortium that provides for one-on-one interactions  and mentoring for the students from the world's leading semantic web researchers. Students benefit from  exposure to state-of-the-art semantic web research, opportunities to attend tutorials on emerging research topics.  Collectively, these activities help integrate graduate students into the established semantic web research community and provides a natural avenue for integration of research and education.",
