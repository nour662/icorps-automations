 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is studying data from seismometers and borehole strainmeters in southern California to understand better what signals they can and cannot detect. The detection levels are largely controlled by noise in the earth and in the instruments, and the project aims to characterize this, especially in two areas. One is at the frequencies of seismic waves, where it is important to understand the variations in noise level from natural sources and human activities. The other is at periods of days to months, over which the strainmeters can be affected by groundwater changes. The project will be examining strainmeter and pumping data to develop models of how this effect works.",
