 "awd_abstract_narration": "Green chemistry and engineering offer fundamental sustainable solutions to the global challenges facing this planet. Green chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances. Green engineering is the development and commercialization of industrial processes that are economically feasible and reduce the risk to human health and the environment. Green chemistry and engineering are absolutely essential to the development of solutions to global challenges.The impact of green chemistry and engineering approaches on sustainable development are significant, since these design philosophies unite the pursuit of economic prosperity with environmental and public health protection.\r\n\r\nThe annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference (www.GCandE.org) is organized each year by the American Chemical Society (ACS) Green Chemistry Institute\u00ae (ACS GCI) with the active involvement of an organizing committee comprised of scientists from other non-profit organizations, U.S. government agencies, academic institutions and industry. Dr. Jennifer Young serves as the PI for the ACS Green Chemistry Institute.\r\n\r\nThe 15th Annual GC&E Conference in 2011 will tie together the International Year of Chemistry and the 5th International Conference on Green and Sustainable Chemistry. Students participating in the GC&E workshop and/or conference will have a unique opportunity to engage in topics not commonly encountered in traditional university courses and conferences. The meeting is expected to convene a record number of approximately 600 plus leading international researchers from industry, academe, and government to discuss the latest advances in green chemistry and engineering from across the spectrum of the chemical enterprise. This dynamic event provides students with excellent opportunities to learn about the newest research developments across all topics of GC&E, dialog with other academic, industrial, and governmental researchers, and expand their network of professional contacts.",
