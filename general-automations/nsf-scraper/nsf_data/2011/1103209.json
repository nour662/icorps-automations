Output from the paleoclimate model simulations will be made accessible and incorporated into undergraduate and graduate classes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the course of this award, the project PI and co-PI, along with a postdoctoral researcher, investigated climate changes taking place in the past on timescales over which the orbital configuration of the earth has varied.  Our primary interest in looking \"backward\" in time at these past climates (paleoclimates) is motivated by what they may tell us about the workings of the climate system.  Indeed, comparison of climate states subject to different forcings&mdash;in the case of paleoclimates, from variations in the spatial and temporal distribution and/or total amount of energy received from the sun&mdash;can provide insights into how climate may evolve in the future.  Throughout the course of this proposal, we actively sought to \"bridge the divide\" between the study of current climates and paleoclimate. \n\nOur main thrust of research focused on an area of intense precipitation in the South Pacific known as the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ).  Although a prominent feature of current climate, the reasons for the existence of this rainband, as well as its unique characteristics, e.g., its diagonal tilt from northwest to southeast, remain unclear.  Available climatic indicators, or \"paleoproxies\", of the SPCZ during the mid-Holocene, 6000 years before present, suggest a southeastward shift of this rainband.  We analyzed a suite of global climate models, the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP; specifically, the Phase 2 ensemble), and found these models to capture a similar spatial displacement of the SPCZ under mid-Holocene forcing conditions (a combination of changes to solar insolation and greenhouse gases).  Based on our analysis of the PMIP2 ensemble, we concluded that differences simulation of sea surface temperature (SST) between modern and mid-Holocene conditions are a necessary ingredient for the SPCZ displacement.  Other factors, such as changes in the strength of the Australian monsoon circulation, appear to be of secondary importance.\n\nThe other key research carried out during the course of this award investigated how changes in the tilt of the earth\u00c6s axis of rotation (or obliquity) impacts large-scale temperature gradients across the equator as well as between the equator and the poles.  We demonstrated how changes in these temperature gradients translate to changes in the general circulation of the atmosphere.  In the spirit of \"bridging the divide\" alluded to above, we applied a theoretical concept from current climate used to describe the general circulation atmospheric general circulation (known as the transformed Eulerian mean) in a paleoclimate setting.  As far as we are aware, our study was the first application of the transformed Eulerian mean to the study of past climate.\n\nThis project provided funding and training for a postdoctoral researcher; it also provided partial funding support for a PhD student.  The award facilitated the PI, co-PI, and postdoctoral researcher's participation in national and international conferences and workshops.  It was a key component of the PI's promotion from assistant to associate professor with tenure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin R Lintner"
