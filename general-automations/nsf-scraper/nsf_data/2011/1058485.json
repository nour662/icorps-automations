 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaboration between natural and social scientists and scientists and non-scientists has been increasing in what has been referred to as Mode 2 science.  Large research problems are increasingly perceived to require expertise from both natural and social scientists and the participation of public sectors and collaboration is often encouraged or required by funding agencies.  Despite increased interdisciplinary and science/non-science collaboration, there is still limited research into why it succeeds or fails and its unique problems, impacts, and interactive forms.  Even more limited is research on collaboration teams designed by social scientists.  This project takes advantage of two currently funded NSF centers on societal dimensions of nanotechnology as research sites to improve our understanding of interdisciplinary and science/non-science collaboration.\r\n\tThe project involves a detailed study of collaboration at the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers (NSECs) at Arizona State University and University of California, Santa Barbara.  Each center emphasizes collaborative ties between social scientists and natural scientists and engineers and between scientists and stakeholders, the broader public, and policy makers in its mission and design.  A post-doctoral fellow, with active guidance of the PI, conducts 3-4 months of on-site observations of collaboration, conducts personal interviews with collaborating participants, and collects other relevant data.   Several research questions guide the project, but questions 2, 5, and 7 are prioritized.  1) What are the different forms and goals of interdisciplinary and interorganizational collaboration?  2) What are the effects of collaboration on productivity and how does collaboration itself affect participants? perceptions of productivity?  3) How do patterns of collaboration vary across academic hierarchies at the centers?  4) What organizational features of the center and university facilitate interdisciplinary and interorganizational collaboration?  5) What communicative barriers and strategies are prevalent in interdisciplinary collaborative relationships and how are they managed?  6) What unique challenges and successes are found in interorganizational collaborations at the centers?  7) How are public engagement activities designed to enhance the potential for scientist/public collaboration? \r\n\tIntellectual Merit: Through two detailed case studies, the project generates knowledge about collaboration between social scientists and natural scientists and engineers and between scientists and non-scientists.  The project contributes empirical data to Science, Technology & Society research on interdisciplinary and interorganizational collaboration that has focused on such issues as impacts on productivity, communicative gaps and strategies, tensions and risks, and organizational and network contexts.  This study is unique in that it focuses on centers organized by social scientists.  The project contributes empirical data to theoretical work on interdisciplinary trading zones and the notion of interactional and contributory expertise.  It also contributes to theoretical work that critically assesses the science policy move towards increased public engagement.\r\n\tBroader Impacts: Although not designed as an evaluative project, results nonetheless provide information on collaboration to center leaders of these two NSECs. Beyond this localized impact, a policy paper on collaboration oriented to social science organized interdisciplinary centers is developed and made accessible to NSF and other funding agencies engaged in support of interdisciplinary collaboration.  From a personal professional standpoint, this project also is an excellent opportunity for a post-doc to engage in cutting edge STS research, while expanding a professional network through connections to center personnel.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research project was a study of interdisciplinary collaboration at two centers for the study of nanotechnology in society.  A postdoctoral fellow was placed in each center for part of a year to make observations, conduct personal interviews, and participate in center activities.  There have been many studies of natural science and engineering directed interdisciplinary research.  This project was unique in its focus on social science directed centers, with natural science and engineering participants.\n\nWe observed that social scientists face challenges related to development and maintenance of infrastructure (especially human) and handling professional identities. In terms of infrastructure, since many social scientists work outside of physical laboratories (primarily in personal offices), they may not have access to a place and space that is perceived by participants as an \"interdisciplinary\" space in an important symbolic sense.&#8239; A bounded place for interdisciplinary human infrastructure (e.g., assistant administrators, post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, staff members, and meeting space) is particularly important for inter- and intra-organizational activity so that participants are ready to put on their \"interdisciplinary hat\".&#8239; This human infrastructure also plays an important role in managing often unwieldy and arbitrarily standardized forms of communication and budget management between the center and funding agency, between the center and university account managers, and among researchers.&#8239; We believe that this aspect of interdisciplinary social science research has been underappreciated and underfunded by reviewers and granting agencies, yet it is essential for interdisciplinary success.\nIn terms of identity, we found two different avenues for accounting for interdisciplinarity across the two research sites.&#8239; At one site, an interdisciplinarity identity was adapted as a personal identity even as researchers maintained strong disciplinary ties, disciplinary workspace, and co-researchers with similar research skill and educational background.&#8239; Participants saw themselves as holding an interdisciplinary identity simultaneously with their disciplinary identity.  At the other site, interdisciplinarity was an identity connected to the collaborative activity with diverse researchers focused on a problem that lies outside the domain of any one discipline.&#8239; The research problems themselves initiated the interdisciplinary identity.&#8239; Both forms of interdisciplinary identity are viable and effective, but are typically not considered in decisions about funding interdisciplinary research.&#8239; To the extent funding agencies continue to promote and fund interdisciplinary research, identity differences, such as these (and perhaps others), need to be considered in decision-making and be understood and integrated to the project by project leaders.\nThe project has intellectual merit in the sense of being one of the first studies of interdisciplinary research directed by social scientists to detect unique aspects and problems.  The project has broader impacts in that it identified challenges related to interdisciplinary research that should be considered in the review and granting of future social science interdisciplinary projects.  In addition, the project provided useful research training for a postdoctoral fellow who is now an assistant professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/07/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen C Zehr"
