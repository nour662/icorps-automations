This provides a probe of the size of the emitting regions, their velocities via the line profiles, and allows an estimate of the mass of the central super-massive black hole. This \"reverberation mapping\" method is the primary way of measuring the masses of black holes in the central regions of active galaxies out to high redshifts.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs.  Public outreach includes involvement in the COSMOS high school summer science teaching program.",
