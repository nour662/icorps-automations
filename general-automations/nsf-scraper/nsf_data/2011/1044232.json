 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a team-taught cross-disciplinary course to promote systems thinking as a way to understand the various engineering, design, and economic issues of sustainability. Team projects form the basis of a problem-based learning approach and are drawn from four different colleges: Engineering, Design and Architecture, Education, and Business-Economics. Learning goals for students and faculty include: i) a better understanding of the complex cross-disciplinary socio-technical issues of sustainability, ii) an understanding of and ability to use \"systems thinking\" approaches to better explore these complexities, and iii) enhanced ability to communicate and collaborate successfully in cross-disciplinary projects. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the co-mingling of disciplinary perspectives that offers students and faculty new and challenging opportunities for learning, communication and collaboration. In addition the \"systems thinking\" framework enables students to see their learning as integral and functional, rather than as a set of discrete \"tacked on\" features. Finally, problem-based learning demands active engagement by students in making their assumptions explicit, formulating hypotheses and models, and testing those ideas against those of their peers. The project envisions \"Systems Thinking for Sustainability\" as a catalyst, first for similar cross-disciplinary courses at the PI's institution and then at other institutions. By developing and disseminating a set of learning outcomes useful in cross-disciplinary courses that bring together core STEM fields with related areas, the project is broadening its impact.",

Working against that interdisciplinary approach is the inevitable narrowing of perspective as students move deeper into their majors. This narrowing, while useful for depth of knowledge in one area, did not really prepare students for life after graduation working in multidisciplinary teams in industry and government as well as in academic research.
