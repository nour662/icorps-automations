 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arun Yethiraj of the University of Wisconsin is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to develop coarse-grained models for polymers and ionic liquids. The quantity of primary interest is the phase behavior. Physical insight will be obtained by studying single chain properties, the free energy of association between chains, and the properties of the polymers in the one phase region. Of particular interest for ionic liquid solutions is the correlation between the polymer behavior and the nano-structured heterogeneous nature of the solvent. The proposed research will focus on the role of chemical details and solvent effects on the properties of the polymers. This has been an un-explored area of research to date.\r\n\r\nThe Yethiraj group will carry out research on understanding how polymers behave when they are dissolved in ionic liquids. Ionic liquids have the potential to substitute for environmentally less benign solvents. The research is aimed at developing chemically realistic models for polymers and ionic liquids that incorporate a high level of detail, but are nevertheless amenable to large-scale computation for realistic molecular weights. This will be achieved by adapting recent advances in the development of molecular models for biological systems.",

Simple salts, such as table salt, are solid or crystalline at room temperature.  The molecules of ionic liquids, however, are bulky and cannot pack, and this makes solidification difficult.  Consequently they are liquid at room temperature.  To be useful as materials they require mechanical strength which can be provided by a polymer, i.e., plastic, scaffold.  The work performed concerns the behavior of polymer molecules in ionic liquids at a molecular level.\n\nTo study molecular systems using computational methods one requires what is called a force field - a set of equations that describes the forces between molecules.  In our work we have developed a new set of force fields for polymers and ionic liquids that we show are accurate.  \n\n\nUsing these force fields we evolve the molecules using Newton's equations of motion and study the average properties.  We obtain new physical insight into the conditions under which the polymers and ionic liquids mix and why.  Oil and water do not mix for entropic reasons, i.e., there are more ways to arrange the molecules if the oil and water are separate than if they are mixed.  Interestingly, polymers and ionic liquids do not mix for similar entropic reasons.\n\n\nUnder the auspicies of this grant we have performed experiments in elementary school classrooms explaining why oil and water do not mix and, more generally, what two substances mix.
