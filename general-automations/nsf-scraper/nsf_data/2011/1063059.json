 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teachers and undergraduate students participate in an integrated materials-focused summer research and education program at the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR), a NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC). Twelve undergraduate students funded by this grant join additional students funded by the MRSEC program to participate annually in a variety of 10-week-long research projects covering a broad range of materials-related topics including the synthesis, simulation and testing of new materials such as atomic membranes, complex oxides, carbon nanotubes and quantum dots, as well as devices made from novel materials such as single molecule transistors, solar cells, vaccine delivery vehicles, and green nanocomposites. A stimulating cohort experience is created through weekly seminars, field trips, workshops on communication and research ethics, a graduate school panel discussion, and a research symposium.\r\n\t\r\nIn addition, five middle school and high school teachers are introduced annually to scientific research through team research projects and curriculum development. The teachers are introduced to the tools of materials research through hands-on projects and then design experiments to solve posed challenges They  also gain a broader understanding of materials science through a variety of activities and create a materials-oriented curriculum project suitable for their classrooms.",
