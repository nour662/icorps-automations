The Bakry-Emery Ricci\r\ncurvature is an important generalization of Ricci curvature for\r\nsmooth metric measure space, which occurs naturally as the\r\ncollapsed measured Gromov-Haudorff limit. Furthermore, the\r\nBakry-Emery Ricci curvature plays important roles in a variety of\r\ntopics such as the study of Ricci soliton, warped Einstein\r\nmetric, diffusion process, logrithmic Sobolev inequality, as well\r\nas in the extension of Ricci curvature lower bound for metric\r\nmeasure space. The principal investigator will study the geometry\r\nof Ricci solitons; relation between comparison geometry and Ricci\r\nflow and obtaining a combined estimate for the first eigenvalue\r\nfor Ricci positive and nonnegative lower bound.  The PI will also\r\nstudy the structures of the fundamental groups for manifolds with\r\nlower integral Ricci curvature bound as well as minimal volume of\r\nhyperbolic orbifolds.\r\n\r\nBakry-Emery Ricci curvature and Ricci soliton play a very\r\nimportant role in Ricci flow, which led to the solution of\r\nPoincare conjecture.  Quasi-Einstein metrics is are important\r\nboth in mathematics and physics.  Smooth metric measure space is\r\nalso related to optimal transport, information geometry, discrete\r\ngeometry. The proposed activities would have impact on all these\r\ndirections.  The fundamental group is the most fundamental (as\r\nthe name implies) topological information. Its understanding will\r\ngreatly advance the study of the effect of curvature bounds on\r\nthe global topology of Riemannian manifolds, therefore will be\r\nhelpful in answering questions about the shape of the universe.",
