 "awd_abstract_narration": "Questions of neural synchrony -- correlations in cell-to-cell spiking -- have \r\ndriven decades of research.  However, recent technological and theoretical \r\nadvances have thrust open two lines of inquiry.  The first is understanding \r\nthe combinatorial scale of the correlations that occur in natural and model \r\nneural networks.  It is well known that describing neural activity requires \r\npairwise statistical interactions -- but we do not yet understand when network \r\ndynamics produce patterns of correlations that extend beyond this pairwise \r\ndescription, when the pairwise descriptions will be complete, and what the \r\noverall implications are for neural coding and signal processing.  \r\nThe Principal Investigator will address these questions for a set of \"canonical\" \r\nneural circuits, or motifs, and will build toward networks of gradually \r\nincreasing complexity in their dynamics and architecture.  Further, extending \r\nbeyond intrinsic network dynamics, he will ask how these basic network properties \r\ndetermine the ways in which patterns of synchrony can be controlled by external stimulation.   \r\nAnswering these complementary questions requires synergies between methods of \r\nstochastic processes, dynamical systems, and statistical inference.\r\n\r\nHow do how networked neurons work together to produce the brain's astonishing \r\ncomputational ability?   Such coordinated neural dynamics are characterized by \r\nsynchrony among different neurons.  One prospect is that this coordinated \r\nactivity opens new channels for signal processing:  there is a combinatorial \r\nexplosion in the number of possible multi-neuron patterns that can occur in \r\nincreasingly large networks.  However, we only have the first hints at whether \r\nand when these patterns systematically occur in the brain's networks, and what \r\ninformation they might (or might not) carry.  Shea-Brown will study the \r\nfundamental properties of neural dynamics, connectivity, and noise that \r\ndetermine the level and impact of multi-neuron synchrony in a series of \r\nnetworks of gradually increasing complexity.  He will use \r\ninterdisciplinary tools from both deterministic and statistical branches of \r\napplied mathematics to understand how levels of synchrony are created, \r\ndestroyed, and manipulated by external stimulation.   These findings will \r\ncontribute to experimental and clinical neuroscience:  working in \r\ncollaboration with experimentalists, the investigator will make predictions for light stimuli \r\nthat evoke higher-order correlations in the retina, and for electrical stimuli \r\nthat suppress pathological synchrony in neurodegenerative disease.  These \r\nquestions, as part of theoretical neuroscience -- an emerging field that is \r\nrich in open questions and highly varied interdisciplinary techniques -- \r\npresent a strong opportunity for recruiting, engaging, and training \r\nundergraduates in the mathematical sciences.  Shea-Brown will direct this opportunity \r\ntoward the underrepresented groups from which new scholars are most urgently \r\nneeded, through an integrated four-year research pathway for undergraduates.  \r\nThis will be developed together with newly designed units in the computational \r\nscience and mathematical biology courses taught by the investigator.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe brain?s function arises from the coordinated activity of vast numbers of neurons.  Given the huge number of different ways that neurons can fire together, how can such collective neural activity be measured and described?  And what are the origins of collective activity in the interaction networks among neurons and in the way each cell translates its inputs into spikes?  \n\n\nWe used mathematical modeling and analysis to advance our understanding of these fundamental questions in neuroscience.  We began by studying the extent of collective, or correlated, neural activity.  This is often quantified via ``higher-order correlations,?? which describe statistical interactions among increasingly larger sets of cells.  Our work identified basic mechanisms which both promote and suppress higher-order correlations in neural circuits.  We also developed elementary rules for how certain higher order correlations be captured in statistical models, and how they can impact the information encoded in neural groups.\n\n\nThere is increasing evidence that the collective activity that occurs deep in the brain has a property known as chaos:  due to ``runaway\" feedback interactions, it generates and sustains its own unpredictability.  We found that the population structure of this intrinsic variability has a surprising and useful property:  it impacts only subsets of cells at a time, creating opportunities for unexpectedly high fidelity signaling in others.  \n\n\nBiological rhythms are another very important category of coordinated neural activity.  Such rhythms serve key biological roles, such as generating the periodic signals that drive respiration.  At the same time, if they become too strong or sharply defined, or occur in the wrong areas, such rhythms can also cause pathologies.  For the paradigmatic case of respiratory networks, we identified an interplay between coupling mechanisms that serves both necessary functions:  creating, but also limiting, rhythmic synchrony. \n\n\nThe study of collective brain dynamics using mathematics and computation provides a perspective on the mathematical sciences that is distinctly different from what most students experience in their high school and undergraduate years.  This creates an opportunity to engage new members of the STEM community.  We conducted a series of research exposure workshops targeted to incoming underrepresented groups that revealed what is like to work in this exciting and rapidly evolving field, while teaching basic programming and computational concepts.  Further investing in the future, trainees from the undergraduate to postdoctoral levels performed years of advanced research, and new courses and programs in mathematical neuroscience were put into place.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric T Shea-Brown"
