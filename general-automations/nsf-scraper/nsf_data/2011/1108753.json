Dr. Ozel and her graduate students will model the mass distribution of black holes and neutron stars, simulate accretion onto black holes and neutron stars, perform relativistic calculations of the spacetime near neutron stars, and investigate the properties of nuclear matter in neutron stars.\r\n\r\nResults from this project are expected to have an impact in the areas of stellar evolution, nuclear physics, and gravitational wave physics.  In addition to her theoretical work, Dr. Ozel will continue her interactions with physics teachers in the Tucson area, and will engage popular outreach on the subject neutron stars and black holes.",
