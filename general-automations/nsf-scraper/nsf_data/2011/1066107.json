An underrepresented area of study is the development and application of emissive biosensors to monitor nucleoside transport and metabolism in living cells. Toward this goal, nucleosides will be synthesized where phosphorescent metal tags replace conventional nucleobases. Two new synthetic protocols join cyclometalated iridium(III) and platinum(II) to deoxyribose, creating emitting agents that monitor the biochemical reactions of nucleoside metabolism. The comprehensive studies proposed here will characterize these unique compounds at the molecular (ground- and excited-state methods), cellular (transport and imaging studies), and organismal (animal imaging studies) levels. \r\n\r\nThe work will support student training in the Gray and Berdis research laboratories, whose members include participants from several underrepresented groups. The use of cyclometalated bioprobes is being incorporated into undergraduate and graduate-level Bioinorganic Chemistry courses in the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCBET-1066107 supported research in the Chemical Biology of nucleoside transporters.  The Gray and Berdis collaboration has invented cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes that are recognized and taken up by human equilibrative nucleoside transporters.  The new probes luminesce in cytoplasm and organelles.\n\nIntellectual Merit.  This project confronts the problem of tracking nucleoside transport in cells noninvasively and without radioactivity.  Chemical syntheses have been devised that unite a protein recognition element&mdash;a deoxyribose sugar&mdash;to a series of optical probes.  A copper-catalyzed \"click\" cycloaddition links azidosugars to the organic ligands of cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes.  These are durable, bright light-emitting molecules.  Their chemical inertness, bright emission, and microsecond excited state lifetimes commend iridium(III) complexes to the problem of nucleoside transport.  Biochemical studies in the human KB3-1 cell line show that the probes are transported.  After initial buildup in the cytoplasm, they accumulate in the nucleus and mitochondria.  Nucleosides carrying cyclometalated iridium(III) are competent substrates for the equilibrative transporter hENT1.\n\nThe major obstacle to nucleoside transport research is heavy reliance on radioisotope labeling, with its hazards and discontinuous (often post-mortem) assaying.  With phosphorescent probes, imaging in cells with an optical microscope is feasible.  Probes are phosphorescent with large Stokes shifts that minimize interference from cellular autofluorescence.  Real-time imaging of nucleoside transport in cells has been achieved.\n\nBroader Impacts.  Not enough is known about the mechanism of nucleoside transport.  A fundamental understanding of transport and biodisposition of nucleosides has implications throughout mammalian biology.  The broad impacts of this research come from developing the tools to monitor nucleoside transport and their validation in cells.\n\nNSF support sustained the professional training of graduate students, undergraduates, and postdoctoral researchers.  These students will benefit from training in Chemistry and Chemical Biology.  Gray and Berdis routinely presented results at Gordon Research Conferences and national meetings of the American Chemical Society.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas G Gray"
