 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North American Dendroecological Fieldweek (NADEF) has been providing advanced education in tree-ring research through project-based learning for 20 years. The current project will provide funding for the next five years to acquire state-of-the-art equipment and includes funds to offset participant fees to students to make attendance easier for undergraduate and graduate students. Tree-ring research (or dendrochronology) uses the annual growth of trees to record environmental variables such as climate, fires, or insect outbreaks. Anything that affects tree-growth could potentially be dated using tree rings. The fieldweek teaches the skills of crossdating (matching the pattern of wide and narrow rings to apply exact dates to every ring) and the statistical techniques necessary to interpret what is affecting tree growth by using hands-on teaching techniques that enable learners to understand the process more fully and to comprehend the practice of dendrochronology on a research project from start to finish. \r\n\r\nNADEF is a nine-day workshop that has approximately 40 participants. The participants choose to become a member of the research team on one of five original research projects that are conducted during the fieldweek under the guidance of experienced dendrochronologists. Participants are divided into groups on fire history, climate reconstruction, stand-age structure, insect outbreak histories, dating archaeological dwellings, among other activities. With respect to broader impacts, the fieldweeks have given researchers as well as undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to interact and network with others. Furthermore, the research that is completed each year contributes to the local resource management knowledge base and can grow into long-term research agendas. Past fieldweek projects have also been the kernel for further work on a thesis or dissertation and have become published papers. As the fieldweek comes to an end, participants from each group present their findings back to the whole group and turn in a short research paper describing their methods and findings.",

Dendrochronology, the science of tree-ring dating, is occasionally misapplied or applied incorrectly, so this fieldweek helps participants ensure that the techniques they use are correct and the latest made available by science. NADEF is divided into up to six groups, with each group led by one or two experts in that subdiscipline of dendrochronology, such as dendroarchaeology, dendroclimatology, and dendroecology. Participants at NADEF join the group in which they are most interested, usually to further their training (as with graduate students and professionals) or to learn a new skill set. Over the past five NADEF events in which I co-organized and served as a Group Leader, my groups conducted investigations that ranged from dendroarchaeology (2011 and 2012) to fire history (2014) to climatology (2015) to advanced climatology (2016). Our participants learned all the critical field and laboratory skills, including gaining experience with hardware and software used, needed to perform valid scientific experiments and were instructed on how to apply the scientific method to help answer questions pertaining to the natural environment. The results from the 2011 and 2012 NADEF projects were instructive and vital to understanding the cultural history of an area based on when Euro-Americans initially occupied a region and began building structures and modifying the landscape. The results from the 2014 fire history project was conducted in an area where the primary pine species, whitebark pine, is decreasing due to various natural (mountain pine beetle) and human-caused (white pine blister rust) disturbances, and our project provided useful information to land management personnel concerning the past history of fire occurrences to better manage this fragile landscape. Lastly, the results from the 2015 and 2016 NADEF projects have immediate applications to extend our understanding of habitats and ecosystems that are currently facing challenges due to increasing pervasive human disturbances, including ongoing climate change. The 2015 NADEF project was conducted in the one location where four native pine species intersect on a lone mountain top in the northeastern U.S. and our results showed that two species will largely be unaffected by global warming while two other pine species may see their ranges restricted. Our 2016 NADEF project focused on reconstructing Pacific Climate Variability to better understand longer-term oscillations in ocean-atmosphere teleconnections that affect continental climate, tree growth, and ecosystem processes. All results from our research over these five NADEF events were shared with the agencies hosting the events as well as the federal agencies in charge of the lands on which we sampled (e.g. USDA National Forests and National Park Service). The results from two NADEF projects (2011 and 2012) resulted in the publication of two articles in peer-reviewed journals, while the results from the 2014 and 2015 NADEF events are currently being formatted and revised for eventually submission. We also intend on submitting the results from our 2016 NADEF event to a peer-reviewed journal. Several presentations, both oral and as posters, have resulted from this research, often presented by graduate students to further their academic training. Overall, NADEF has provided a rich learning experience, not only for the hundreds of participants who have participated over the past 26 years, but also for the many group leaders who have generously donated their time to assist in training the next generation of scientists.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/03/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Henri&nbsp;D&nbsp;Grissino-Mayer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1061501/1061501_10078998_1499090886433_2016-07-2616.36.30--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1061501/1061501_10078998_1499090886433_2016-07-2616.36.30--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2016 NADEF Advanced Climate Group\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1061501/1061501_10078998_1499090886433_2016-07-2616.36.30--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2016 NADEF Advanced Climate Group\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Members of the 2016 Advanced Climate Group, led by Henri Grissino-Mayer (left) and Bryan Black (right), search for suitable western hemlock samples in Mt.
