 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the development of computational methods for\r\ntomosynthesis breast image reconstruction, a technique used to\r\nreconstruct 3-dimensional images using slightly modified versions of\r\nconventional x-ray systems. The mathematical models addressed in this\r\nproject are difficult ill-posed inverse problems; computed solutions\r\nare very sensitive to errors in the data, and implementation for large\r\nscale 3-dimensional images is nontrivial.  All previous breast\r\ntomosynthesis image reconstruction algorithms use a simplified, but\r\nincorrect assumption that the source x-ray beam is comprised of\r\nphotons with a constant energy; that is, the x-ray beam is assumed to\r\nbe monoenergetic.  The simplified monoenergetic assumption results in\r\na linear mathematical model.  This project uses the physically\r\ncorrect, and hence more accurate, assumption that the x-ray beam is\r\npolyenergetic.  The resulting mathematical model is nonlinear,\r\nproviding great challenges to the development and analysis of\r\nmathematical models, as well as for the development of computational\r\nmethods.  However, as this project reveals, the nonlinear model allows\r\nfor reconstructing images with substantially fewer artifacts than the\r\nlinear model.  Moreover, the nonlinear model can incorporate\r\nparameterizations to allow for explicit decomposition of the breast\r\ninto distinct materials, such as, glandular tissue, adipose tissue,\r\ncalcifications, and iodinated contrast agents, thereby providing\r\nimproved diagnostic information.\r\n\r\nIn the US, over 200,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every\r\nyear, but there is a 97% five-year survival rate if the cancer is\r\nlocalized, and if it is discovered before it spreads to other parts of\r\nthe body.  Therefore, improved imaging techniques that help to detect\r\nand diagnose breast cancer early can have a profound impact on the\r\nhealthcare of women.  The research in this project focuses on\r\ntomosynthesis imaging, which just received FDA approval for clinical\r\nuse in 2011, because it has the potential to provide substantially\r\nbetter screening capabilities than mammography. The new mathematical\r\nand computational approaches developed in this work are designed to\r\nunlock the potentially transformative benefits of tomosynthesis for\r\nbreast cancer screening, providing significantly better diagnostic\r\ninformation to physicians.  In addition to its application to breast\r\ncancer screening, tomosynthesis, in its whole-body implementation can\r\nbe used for many other applications where standard x-ray and CT are\r\nused, such as chest imaging for detection of lung nodules, as well as\r\nnon-medical imaging applications such as nuclear waste inspections and\r\nexplosive detection.  Thus, advances in computational methods for this\r\napplication can have a very broad impact in the imaging field.\r\nCollaborations between researchers in Mathematics and Computer Science\r\nand researchers in the Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences\r\nand Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University facilitates\r\ntransitioning new software to clinical use.",
