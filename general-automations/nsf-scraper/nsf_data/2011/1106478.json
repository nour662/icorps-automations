The span of this conference\r\nseries is unique among international conferences with an emphasis on\r\ncombinatorial mathematics.  The principal topics featured during the\r\nFPSAC 2011 and 2012 conferences will be algebraic, geometric, and\r\nenumerative combinatorics. The emphasis will be on applications in\r\nphysics, biology, and computer science and on relations to other areas\r\nof mathematics such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra,\r\nK-theory, geometric group theory, representation theory, and\r\nsymplectic geometry.",
