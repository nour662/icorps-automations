 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to\r\ncommercialize a new process to recycle petroleum toxic wastes to clean and inexpensive\r\nenergy. This Phase II project will scale the improved process by modifying the company?s pilot\r\nunit to incorporate the enhancements realized with the bench scale unit in Phase I. The basic\r\nSuperATR is a non&#8208;catalytic process that employs a cyclic flow reactor filled with an inert packed\r\nbed. In the cyclic flow reactor, the direction of oxidizer/fuel mixture is periodically reversed\r\nproducing a high temperature volume. The modifications in the Phase I project effectively\r\nraised the temperature even higher to make the reactor even more efficient.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are that deteriorating qualities of oils and gases is forcing\r\nthe petroleum sector to incur very high cost for energy and waste disposal. For example, the\r\nbenign disposal of hydrogen sulfide costs oil refineries and natural gas processing plants $5\r\nbillion a year. Present technologies only permit extracting the sulfur content while wasting the\r\nmuch more valuable hydrogen portion. In commercializing this technology, the value\r\npropositions are but not limited to:\r\n&#61623; Obtain 9 billion kilowatt hours of carbon&#8208;free electricity and steam inexpensively.\r\n&#61623; Lowering gasoline and diesel prices, even by 1 cent per gallon, would leave $2 billion in\r\nthe hands of Americans.\r\n&#61623; Eliminate 5 million tons of greenhouse gas along with 1.5 million tons of acid rain\r\npollutants by helping refineries and natural gas plants exceed environmental standards.",

The Phase I bench-scale reactor achieved another significant milestone: a 38% yield of hydrogen from hydrogen sulfide.  The obtained hydrogen sulfide-to-hydrogen yield is the highest ever from a thermal process.\n\nHydrogen sulfide is a toxic waste that cost the petroleum sector $2.5 billion a year to capture and dispose of.  Present technologies, notably the Claus Process, only permits recovery of the sulfur content while wasting the much more valuable hydrogen portion.  In addition, Claus-based sulfur recovery units emit significant quantities of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen: harmful pollutants that causes acid rain.  Those pollutants are the root cause behind the heavy fines, $2 billion in the last 12 years, \n\nThe SuperATR will not only recover sulfur, it will also extract the much more valuable hydrogen content.  The extracted hydrogen can be utilized to generate clean electricity or used as chemical feedstock for the production of ammonia or methanol.  Unlike the Claus process, it will emit much less other byproducts that causes acid rain.\n\nIt its attempt to commercialized the SuperATR process with this Phase II SBIR grant, the team constructed a robust reactor with ten times the capacity of the Phase I reactor.  After construction, the system was tested with natural gas to ascertain operational integrity as well as efficiency. The tests confirm that the reactor operates more efficiently than anticipated.\n\nAs part of the commercialization effort, IES is negotiating with a small oil and gas company to install a unit at their sour gas plant in rural Kentucky.  To finance that effort, IES has and still reaching out to a number of potential strategic investors.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jacques P Bingue"
