 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of learning science researchers, game designers, game theory researchers, and environmental scientists to engage diverse audiences in the science of sustainability and sustainable development. Taking its inspiration from Buckminster Fuller's \"World Game\" - conceived nearly fifty years ago as a tool to facilitate a comprehensive, participatory approach to addressing the problems of the world - the team is developing, testing, and delivering a real-time, collaborative environment using a distributed, technology-enhanced, game-based architecture to enable groups of individuals to explore the interconnected nature of the economic, social and environmental factors that influence sustainability. The intellectual merit of the project has two key dimensions. First, by making visualizations of scientific data available in public spaces for groups of informal learners, the investigators seek to understand the nature of the resulting participatory engagement with data, giving particular attention to discovering design principles that influence the effectiveness of the visualizations. Second, the investigators are creating innovative interfaces that make computers \"invisible\" and provide alternative tactile, social, and spatially distributed ways to interact with the underlying data, and then studying how such interfaces promote generative and cooperative thinking about sustainability issues. The project is exercising its broader impacts through its contribution to the field's general understanding of the ways in which social, highly participatory environments support deeper and more reflective learning about complex multivariate data. Moreover, the research team is advancing the public understanding of science in general, and sustainability and environmental science in particular.",

A wide variety of tracking, sensing and imaging technologies were explored for scalability in a 900 sq. m. immersive experience for up to 50 simultaneous participants. The result is <em>Connected Worlds</em>, a public experience and human subject research platform of unprecedented scale intended to introduce museum visitors to complex human and environmental systems interactions and their consequences. <em>Connected Worlds</em> provides a research infrastructure to study human dynamics, interaction and social learning in a controlled setting. &nbsp;It includes the capacity to scale tracking technologies for high accuracy and high reliability sensing and logging of human behavior and response in the open world environmental simulation &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo;.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Findings from this work indicate that participants in <em>Connected Worlds</em> can both cooperate and compete in water management in a group setting, can divide labor, take on roles and be collectively strategic about sharing resources to achieve balance among the needs of multiple habitats. Analytical methods are under continued development to cluster and characterize the different emergent behaviors produced by the groups to improve understanding of the kinds of strategies that result in more sustainable ecosystems. By making decision-making a spatialized, performative act, <em>Connected Worlds</em> opens up the possibility of helping learners not just develop understandings about complex systems, but about how humans can work together to manage complex systems.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\"><strong>Broader Impacts<br /></strong>The development of Connected Worlds has been a process of discovering important pathways into fundamental skills and concepts needed by lifelong learners to understand sustainability and the complex ways that human and natural systems couple. By providing a means for both providing opportunities for visitors to learn these important ideas, as well as ways to detect and analyze learning, we can inform the trajectory of learning for important, yet complex and difficult-to-grasp ideas necessary for 21<sup>st</sup> century students, citizens and decisionmakers. Connected Worlds also informs two important trends in technology and learning: the advent of large-scale multiuser, open world computer games and the use of tracking and sensing technologies to locate and characterize human behaviors. Connected Worlds leverages these technologies in a live participatory setting in order to identify the kind of learning that spontaneously emerges in socio-environmental systems, better understand the role of social interaction in learning, and the role of embodied learning in both the social and environmental interactions.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/31/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stephen&nbsp;M&nbsp;Uzzo</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1123832/1123832_10130246_1485880601343_18958494862_4ef7889dda_o-2.s--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1123832/1123832_10130246_1485880601343_18958494862_4ef7889dda_o-2.s--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Overview of Connected Worlds\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1123832/1123832_10130246_1485880601343_18958494862_4ef7889dda_o-2.s--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Overview of Connected Worlds\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Wide view of the experience with visitors showing all habitats and water sources.
