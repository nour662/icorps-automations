 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to the University of Minnesota that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students, during the summers of 2011- 2013. The program focuses on the use of molecular genetics and proteomics tools to address important research problems in gene structure, genome organization and regulation of gene expression in a variety of model systems. Student projects will be conducted under the direction of faculty members who are affiliated with the program. Students will spend the first 3 weeks of the summer program in an intensive 3-credit lab course at the Itasca Biological Station learning basic molecular genetics techniques and at a Proteomics Workshop. Students will then spend 7 weeks on the Twin Cities campus in a faculty laboratory working full time on an independent research project using techniques learned in the course. Additional program activities will include research presentations at weekly student seminars, participation in bioethics workshops, and participation in evening sessions designed to strengthen future applications for graduate studies. Students will be recruited at national meetings, during campus visits, and through the NSF and program web sites. Students will be selected based on academic record, letters of recommendation, personal statement, and potential for outstanding research in the biological sciences. Students will be tracked after the program to follow their eventual career paths. The program will be assessed through student and faculty surveys and by use of the REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://www.cbs.umn.edu/main/summer_research/ or by contacting the PI (Dr. Janet Schottel at schot002@umn.edu).",
