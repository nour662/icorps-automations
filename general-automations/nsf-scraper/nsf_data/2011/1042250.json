 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of a\r\nhigh-performance FPGA implementation of full 3-D seismic Waveform Inversion (WFI), the\r\nmost advanced and resource-demanding seismic imaging application used today in the oil and gas\r\nindustry. The objective of WFI is to estimate a model of the Earth?s subsurface that minimizes\r\nthe difference between recorded data and synthetic simulated data derived from an iteratively\r\nadjusted Earth model. The computational kernel of WFI is the 3-D wave equation in a\r\nheterogeneous medium. This equation is solved repeatedly in a gradient optimization process\r\nyielding highly accurate seismic images. The deliverable of the Phase I project will be a novel\r\nField Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of an especially optimized WFI kernel\r\nin the form of a socket compliant special-purpose device. In a continuation Phase II project, the\r\nPhase I deliverable will be evolved into a prototype full-fledged implementation of WFI,\r\ndelivering order-of-magnitudes improvements in performance over conventional software\r\nimplementations on traditional hardware. As microprocessors reach the limits of attainable clock\r\nfrequencies and power consumption, there is a growing need in the oil and gas industry to go\r\nbeyond conventional computer software/hardware solutions. The proposed project addresses this\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to usher in a new era of low impact,\r\nlow energy, and much higher-performance computing in the oil and gas industry. FPGA\r\ncomputing is likely to become a disruptive technology for geophysical exploration, allowing\r\nunprecedented improvements in capability and performance. With the proposed technology, 3-D\r\nseismic data will be processed faster, and used more effectively to characterize and delineate oil\r\nand gas reservoirs in extremely complicated geological settings. Furthermore, the proposed\r\ntechnology will enable WFI in production settings. The urgent need for this new capability is\r\nhighlighted by domestic and foreign oil companies' recent announcements that their main\r\ntechnological focus and critical requirements are for increasingly challenging environments. In\r\nthis context, the accurate, higher resolution, and faster seismic imaging enabled by FPGAs will\r\nhave economic impact by: (1) improving the odds of finding new deposits of oil and gas, (2)\r\nreducing extraction and development costs by providing higher imaging accuracy, (3) increasing\r\nthe amount of hydrocarbons recovered, augmenting the national oil and gas reserves, reducing\r\ndependence on foreign oil, and benefiting the U.S. economy.",

This SBIR Phase I project addresses this drawback by demonstrating the feasibility of a specialized Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of the computational core of WFI, delivering order-of-magnitude improvements in performance over implementations on conventional processors. The Phase I result will be expanded in Phase II into a complete FPGA implementation of WFI, providing a new capability for oil and gas exploration.\nIntellectual Merits\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research project investigated the feasibility of a high-performance Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of full 3-D Waveform Inversion (WFI), the most advanced and resource-demanding application used in industry for oil and gas exploration.

The proposed project addressed this need, and set the stage for a full hardware-implemented version of WFI of unprecedented performance, to be prototyped in the continuation Phase II project.\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe technology developed in this project addresses the  large and unmet demand for compute intensive high-end seismic imaging in the oil and gas industry.  The market for oil &amp; gas exploration software products and services is estimated at $3 billion per year.  Commercial potential of the proposed technology is directly applicable to the fastest growing and strategically most important areas of U.S. exploration, namely the deep water subsalt oil and gas regions of the Gulf of Mexico federal waters, and complex shale gas plays in the continental U.S.  The hardware accelerated wave-equation technology that DRC is proposing to develop to help image these prospects is orders of magnitude faster than what can be done today, and more accurate than what is currently available on the market, and it is therefore much more cost effective.  Currently, due to the excessively long runtime required for 3-D WFI on conventional computers, the seismic exploration industry cannot commercially apply the technology.  With the advent of the technology proposed herein, WFI will be fast enough for deployment in industry, replacing standard depth imaging in the market place and taking over a substantial part of the $500+ million seismic imaging market.
