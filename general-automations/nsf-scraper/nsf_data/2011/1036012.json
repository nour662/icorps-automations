The goal of this symposium is to promote a new synthesis and general theory of neuroecology. Neuroecology synthesizes neuroethological and ecological principles. Neuroecology embodies both the neural basis for behavior and the role of behavior in establishing patterns of organism abundances and species distributions within natural habitats. As such, it scales from molecules to communities and ecosystems. The topics included in the symposium cross the disciplines of animal behavior, neuroscience, chemical/physiological ecology as well as physics and chemistry. Along with senior researchers this this symposium and related events includes participation of graduate students, post-docs and junior faculty including women and ethnic minorities. Symposium proceedings are published in the society's journal, \"Integrative and Comparative Biology\".",
