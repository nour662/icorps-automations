 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides travel support for students and early-career scientists to attend a special Symposium focusing on biological aerosols, to be held in conjunction with the 2011 IUGG (International Union of Geodesy & Geophysics), to be held 28 June-7 July 2011 in Melbourne, Australia.  Motivation for the symposium comes from a growing recognition of the importance of primary biological particles (bacteria, spores and pollen) in atmospheric processes, including processes involved in the formation of clouds and precipitation.  This symposium will explore the current state of knowledge and relevant challenges/perspectives of future research.  In particular, interdisciplinary connections will be facilitated and emphasized as part of the broad IUGG forum.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this activity derives from efforts to increase qualitative and quantitative understanding of processes regulating Earth's weather and climate, and from growing interface between traditionally separate scientific disciplines (viz. biology and geophysics).  Broader Impacts of this award will arise through enabling participation of students and early career scientists in the conference, thereby providing for the enhanced education and training of the next generation of scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objectives\nof this project were to organize a symposium on Bioaerosols in the\nEarth System at the 25th General Assembly of the International\nUnion of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) (summer 2011, Melbourne, Australia) with\nparticular emphasis on promoting the participation of students, young\nscientists and disadvantaged researchers,  to assure broad publication of the topics\npresented at the symposium beyond the proceedings of the IUGG, and 3) to use\nthe symposium as a springboard for publication on prospection about future\nresearch.  The one-day symposium provided\nan opportunity for over 15 presentations from a range of scientific disciplines\nfrom the life and environmental sciences as well as mathematics and modeling.  Many of the speakers were early-career\nscientists.  A summary of all\npresentations and short video interviews of some of the speakers and\nparticipants were posted on the web site dedicated to disseminating information\nabout biological ice nucleators and their role in atmospheric processes (: http://bioice.wordpress.com/). \n\n Several follow-up activities were\norganized as a result of the discussion that was held at the end of the\nsymposium.  A working group was initiated\non feedback processes among land cover, the biological ice nucleators that they\nemit and rainfall.  The working group of\n6 scientists met in France at the end of 2011 and began the processes of\nwriting a review paper on this subject. \nThey resulting manuscript has been submitted for publication to a\nscientific journal and is currently under review.  A second aspect of land-atmosphere feedback\nthat emerged from the discussion was the need for time series statistics to\nevaluate patterns of rainfall from historical records to identify contexts\nwhere feedback could be occurring. \nAnother working group of 3 scientists was established including an early\ncareer spatial statistician.  This\nworking group involves the transfer of competence of an atmosphere scientist\nwith over 50 years of experience toward the younger scientists in the\ngroup.  The manuscript describing the\nstatistical tool will be submitted to a scientific journal by the end of 2013\nand a statistical software package for such analyses will be made available.\nThis will be followed by a second manuscript illustrating its application to\n100-year historical records from Australia. \n\nFunding from the project was\nalso used to cover the publication costs of a paper that included several early\ncareer scientists as authors, and in particular as first author: \n\nAttard, E. , H. Yang, A.-M.\nDelort, P. Amato, U. P&ouml;schl, C. Glaux, T. Koop, and C.E. Morris. 2012. Effects\nof atmospheric conditions on ice nucleation activity of Pseudomonas. Atmos.\nChem. Phys. 12:10667-10677, doi:10.5194/acp-12-10667-2012.\n\n \n\nThe symposium also fostered discussion of the content of several manuscripts that were successfully published soon after the symposium.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/23/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cindy Morris"
