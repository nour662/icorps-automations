 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports continuing fundamental research by Professor Peter C. Ford at the University of California, Santa Barbara into how transition metal centers define the biological chemistry of nitric oxide (NO) and other small molecules that play key regulatory roles in mammalian physiology. These studies will also explore photochemical strategies using new nanomaterials for delivering such species to specific targets. \r\n\r\nIt is now broadly known that NO, nitrogen oxide derivatives such as nitrite ion, carbon monoxide (CO) and several other simple molecular species have profound roles in controlling certain physiological functions including the cardiovascular system, wound healing, immune response to pathogens, etc.  In nearly all such cases, the chemical reactions with metal centers, such as hemoglobin and other iron and copper containing proteins, is essential to the physiological effects.  One goal of the current research is to define and to understand the relevant biochemistry of these metal--small molecule interactions.  The techniques employed are reaction kinetics and modern analytical methods as well as theoretical computations.  Another goal is to design, prepare and test new molecular and nano-scaled assemblies that that can be used with light to deliver such bioregulators to targeted tissues for the purpose of affecting the viability of the target.  By using light as the triggering mechanism one can control the location, timing, and dosages of bioregulator release.  Along this line, the UCSB group has developed new systems where nano-sized semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) serve as templates for carrying the small molecule precursors while simultaneously acting as the antennas for light absorption for triggering.  On-going studies will refine these assemblies and study their effectivity.  From a broader perspective, the UCSB studies will develop fundamental chemical understanding of these bioregulatory molecules that must underlie potential development of new therapeutic applications. \r\n\r\nThe research performed under this award also serves as a template for training undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students in the nuances of creative scholarship.  This also extends to local K-12 schools, since members of the Ford group have participated actively in scientific outreach programs.  Undergraduates leaving the group have entered graduate and medical school programs and Ph.D. and postdoctoral graduates have assumed responsible roles in industry, government and academia, thereby contributing to the US scientific manpower pool.",

The first goal was to develop new strategies and precursors for photochemical delivery of bioactive small molecules (BSMs) to physiological targets with particular emphasis on nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO).  Both NO and CO play roles in mammalian vascular health, and there is a complex interplay of NO, other NOx species and CO in disease states, such as oxidative stress and inflammation, that is not yet fully understood.  Photochemistry provides exquisite control of the timing, location and dosage of such delivery for potential therapy.  However, in order to apply this methodology, it is necessary to design new molecular precursors and delivery vehicles that can utilize tissue-penetrating longer-wavelength visible or near-infrared (NIR) light. To accomplish this task, we have prepared and studied new molecular and nanomaterial antennas that capture NIR irradiation and utilize these to trigger the release of the designated BSMs.  We have also initiated studies of polymer-based nano- and micro-carriers that can transport these precursor-antenna conjugates into cells and tissue (Figs. 1).\n\nThe intellectual merit from these outcomes derives from enhanced understanding of the mechanisms of NO and CO photochemical release from metal complex precursors, and of the photophysical energy transfer from two-photon absorbing antennas as well as from nano-sized semiconductor quantum dots and NIR-to-visible upconverting nanoparticles.  These outcomes are fundamental in nature but provide new concepts necessary for creative application of such photochemical methodologies and new materials in biomedicine. \n\nA second research goal of this grant was to characterize the reactions of NO and of the nitrite ion NO2&ndash; with biologically active metal centers such the heme iron of the protein myoglobin and related model compounds as well as oxidation and reduction reactions of the resulting M-NO or M-NOx complexes.  Our studies have provided new insights into the mechanisms by which nitrite is converted to NO thereby providing protective effects with organs that have undergone ischemia/reperfusion injury as well as better understanding of the chemical reactivity of NO and other NOx relevant to the bioregulatory functions of these species.  \n\nDuring the period of this grant, our laboratory also initiated a kinetics investigation of the reaction of ferrous ions (Fe2+) with NO and the thiol amino acid cysteine in aqueous media.  The result is the formation of dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs), which represent a key source of nitric oxide equivalents in mammalian physiology.  Potential roles of DNICs in disease and normal states are now drawing considerable interest. Elucidating the detailed mechanisms of the relevant chemical transformations is necessary to interpret the roles of these bioactive small molecules in human biochemistry and pathobiology.\n\nThe technical studies supported totally or partially by CHE-1058794 have led to 23 publications in refereed journal, 5 Ph.D. theses and  a number of talks and posters presented at national and international conferences.\n\nBroader aspects of this research include contributions to developing new methods for the targeted therapeutic delivery of bioactive small molecules, and two recent discoveries are the subjects of  intellectual property disclosures that were submitted.\n\nAlso among the broader aspects is that this experimental research serves as a platform for educating the graduate, undergraduate and postdoctoral students who eventually become valuable members of the STEM workforce.  Since 2011, 5 students (all US citizens) completed Ph.D.\u00c6s based on the research sponsored by this grant; of these 2 are Hispanics and two are women. Through other programs, we were able to provide all five with the opportunity to carry out international  research internships (one in Germany, one in Brazil and three..."
