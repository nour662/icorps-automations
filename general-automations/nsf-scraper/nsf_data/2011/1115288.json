 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this project is to develop a strong theoretical \r\nfoundation on local properties of finite element solutions for advection-\r\ndominated optimal control problems. The advection-diffusion partial \r\ndifferential equations (PDEs) are known to be difficult to approximate because \r\ntheir solutions often exhibit discontinuities, layers, and shocks. The \r\nstructure of the solutions to optimal control problems is even more \r\ncomplicated because of the coupling in the optimality system of the governing \r\nadvection-dominated PDE with an advection-dominated adjoint PDE. It is known \r\nthat convergence behavior of finite element methods applied to single \r\nadvection-dominated PDEs can be very different from the convergence behavior \r\nof finite element methods applied to advection-dominated optimal control \r\nproblems. Understanding the global and local convergence behavior is crucial \r\nfor reliable and efficient solution of advection-dominated optimal control \r\nproblems, especially in the presence of control and state constraints, and \r\nobjective functions that depend on pointwise state information. This project \r\nintends to deepen our understanding for various problems and to help develop \r\nreliable numerical methods.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMathematics proved to be extremely useful in modeling many real life problems \r\ncoming from environment, technology, climate, and etc. However, many \r\nmathematical models require special parameters that can not be measured \r\ndirectly. Examples can be shapes in modeling technological devises, physical \r\ncoefficients in environmental processes, controls in navigation and etc. and \r\nneed to be estimated.  Mathematically, estimation of such paramters often \r\nleads to optimization problems with constraints in the form of system partial \r\ndifferential equations (PDEs). Usually, such system of PDEs is well understood \r\nand there are many available numerical techniques to solve it. However, it \r\ndoes not immediately apply that the method that works well for the underlying \r\nsystem of PDEs will work for the constrained optimization problem.  In our \r\nprevious work, we showed such differences in the case of a simple model \r\nproblem. In this proposal we intend to investigate more complicated model \r\nproblems that cover a broader range of applications.",
