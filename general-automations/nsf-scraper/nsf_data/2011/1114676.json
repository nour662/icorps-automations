 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Straub of Boston University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop algorithms for the simulation of molecular systems undergoing strong phase transitions, including the characterization of metastable and unstable states.  Straub and coworkers have developed generalized simulated tempering and replica exchange algorithms which exhibit superior scaling and sampling efficiency for a series of benchmark systems. They are extending and generalizing these algorithms for the simulation of a variety of outstanding problems, including vapor-liquid phase change in simple fluids,  freezing of nano-confined water, and the aggregation and assembly of peptides into functional channels.\r\n\r\nPhase changes, such as the melting of ice or evaporation of water, are ubiquitous in nature but are very difficult to simulate on a computer. This research enables scientists and engineers to model nature more realistically. The PI and his research group are also involved in extensive outreach to grade school, middle schools and high school students through collaboration with the Pinhead Institute, including visits by scientists to the schools and summer internship programs for high schools students.",

Using state-of-the-art high-performance computers and theoretical models, it is now possible to create highly accurate and detailed atomic-level \"movies\" of the structure and dynamics of complex systems involving millions of atoms.   The simulated molecular dynamics can be used to address problems of great importance to chemistry, physics, and biology, including the exploration of properties of novel materials, the function of complex molecular motors, and the aggregation of proteins underlying disease.\n\nA fundamental property of materials and biological systems is the process of \"phase change,\" in which a system maintains the same molecular composition but displays dramatic change in its structure and physical properties. Examples include the freezing of liquid water to solid ice, the aggregation of soluble proteins to form assembled fibrils associated with disease, and the organization of disordered fats into large-scale, ordered structures such as cell membranes.\n\nAt this time, the computer simulation of systems exhibiting \"phase change,\" involving large-scale molecular structures (such as membranes and protein assemblies) and dramatic structural reorganization (such as water freezing), presents outstanding challenges to existing simulation approaches.  The research supported by this award was designed to address these outstanding challenges and provide new computational models and methods for exploring diverse complex molecular systems.\n\nOver the three years of this award, our research developed the generalized Replica Exchange Method (gREM), as an effective approach for the computer simulation of strong phase change in complex molecular systems. The central idea behind gREM is to introduce a \"bias\" in the sampling of possible structures of the system in a way that allows one to explore not only stable states (such as a liquid or solid) but also \"metastable\" and unstable states (such as water crystals nucleating growth on a pathway to ice formation, bubbles forming in liquids on the way to a boiling transition to vapor, and small, short-lived \"oligomeric\" aggregates of protein that seed the growth of large protein fibril assemblies).  As such, gREM allows for the simulation of stable phases as well as the transitions between them.  The key ingredients of gREM are parameterized effective sampling weights that bias the simulation and smoothly join stable phases. The research led to a straightforward method for the application of this inventive computational approach, providing a sure way to achieve efficient computer simulation of diverse molecular systems.\n\nVarious applications have been explored, including studies of the liquid-to-liquid phase change involved in metallic glass formation, the mechanism of vapor-liquid transition in liquids including water, the surprising behavior of water freezing when confined to a \"nanoslit,\" and the organizational transitions of peptides in membranes and micelles.   In addition, a highly efficient method for statistical analysis of the \"big data\" generated by these large-scale simulations was developed, and has already found broad application in the field allowing for the comprehensive characterization of thermodynamic and structural properties of materials and biomolecules.\n\nThis award also supported an ambitious outreach program carried out in collaboration with the Pinhead Institute, a non-profit organization devoted to K-12 science education and outreach in Southwestern Colorado.  The outreach involved the promotion of \"molecular science\" to K-12 students through two Pinhead Institute programs: \"Scholars in the Schools\" (which brings scientists into elementary, middle, and high schools of Southwestern Colorado to make presentations and interact with students and teachers) and the \"Pinhead Internship Program\" (which places talented high school s..."
