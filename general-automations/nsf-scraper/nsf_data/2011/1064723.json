 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the three-year International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) award, Philip D. Rubin, from George Mason University (GMU), will conduct a ten-week, combined Summer research internship-training program for fifteen undergraduates (five per year), in cooperation with CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. CERN houses some of the world's largest and most technically complex scientific instruments in the form of particle accelerators and detectors, and is one of the most vibrant and international research centers in the world. All aspects of particle physics are pursued there: theory, research and development, information technology, experiments, and data analysis.    The Principal Investigator is a member of the NA62 collaboration, a group of about 120 physicists from Europe, Russia, and North America, investigating ultra-rare kaon decays in a fixed target experiment using the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). Annually, CERN conducts a Summer Student Research Programme for nearly 200 undergraduates from around Europe and other countries;  the students supported by this grant will participate in this program, and their projects may come from any of the research areas available at CERN.  \r\n\r\nParticipants will be drawn from students attending a member institution of the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area or the Northern Virginia Community College. The first week of the program will be spent at GMU in a preparatory workshop, and the remaining nine weeks will be spent in Switzerland at CERN. The program will include skill development, research experience under the co-supervision of an on-site CERN expert and Professor Rubin, academic and career advising, and international networking opportunities. Each participating student will make at least one presentation at CERN and write a technical note on the project undertaken.  CERN-stationed mentors will evaluate the experiences from their point of view, and the students will write a short summary and evaluation of their experiences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe International Research Experience for Students at CERN project of George Mason University (GMU) coordinated with the CERN Summer Student Programme to provide fourteen undergraduate students a research internship, advanced instruction in such topics as particle physics, accelerator and detector technology, electronics, and data analysis, and hands-on experience at the world's largest particle accelerator facility.  All students spent an orientation week at GMU before living and working for 8 weeks (9 the first year) at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nMost students worked on one of CERN's major experiments: CMS, ATLAS, ALICE, LHCb, ALPHA, AeGIS, or ISOLDE.  Others worked on infrastructure and future design projects.  Each worked collaboratively under the co-supervision of a CERN-based professional in established groups on a topic integral to the group.  The skills they developed and exercised included computer programming and simulation, data analysis, electronics, and both written and oral presentations.  They attended a series of lectures offered by experts in their fields covering theory, instrumentation, computation, and data analysis.  Each student wrote a paper based on the work accomplished and gave at least one oral presentation to the members of the respective work group.\n\nBroader Impact\n\nAmong the fourteen students who participated in the IRES at CERN program were two women, two Hispanics, and one African-American, and included two Junior College students.  All benefited from an international and collaborative research and learning experience at the world's premier accelerator facility.  By affiliating with the CERN Summer Student Programme, each Summer's IRES at CERN students shared their experiences with over 300 other undergraduate students from several dozen different countries.  In addition to research work with and under the guidance of multi-national professionals, the students attended lectures, workshops, and discussions on important topics in physics, engineering, and computation; visit facilities; and participate in social activities, events, and festivals at CERN and in and around Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nOf the twelve students still in regular contact with the PI, eleven are in graduate school or working in a STEM field (the twelveth has become a first-responder).  All look back on their experience in the IRES at CERN program fondly (\"It was a wonderful experience and I don't know what could have made it better\").  For some, it was decisive: \"The IRES research experience directly contributed to my finding a job.\"\n\nAs one of these students recently wrote:\n\n\"The CERN program was incredible and I think about my time there pretty  much every day.  I would say what sticks in my mind the most is the  atmosphere of the place.  Being constantly surrounded by such a highly  diverse and highly intellectual group of people was a once in a lifetime  experience.  Working and socializing with these kinds of people was  really eyeopening for me.  I also think it helped prepare me for working  in the very global scientific community.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/18/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip D Rubin"
