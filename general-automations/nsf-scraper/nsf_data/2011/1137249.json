 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interplay that occurs among microbes in their habitat allows the microbial community, or \"microbiome\", to carry out chemical processes exceeding that of any individual organism in the community. The successful execution of such complex processes requires a coordination of the metabolisms of the component species. Such coordination is accomplished by directly sending and receiving signals among members of the community. Some signals are indirect, such as those resulting from changes in the local environment caused by their metabolisms. By understanding these signaling processes, it may be possible to manipulate these communities and harness their capabilities on an industrial scale.\r\nThe microbial community inside the gut of the lower termite represents one such community. Consisting of bacteria, archaea, and protists, the organisms in this community exist symbiotically, breaking down complex carbon sources, such as lignocellulose, to the benefit of all. The physical and chemical habitat of the termite gut varies at a spatial scale of microns and affects the structure and function of its microbial community. We hypothesize that the lignocellulosic processing capabilities of the termite gut community are dependent on its composition, the spatial distribution of its members, and their interactions. We further hypothesize that maintenance of the community is regulated through a complex signaling network composed of cell-cell contact dependent signaling and intercellular chemical signaling. By understanding how these processes function, it will be possible to harness the termite microbiome as a platform for chemical production. To test our hypotheses, we will reproduce the micro-scale physical and chemical features of a lower termite gut in manufactured microhabitats, i.e. artificial termite guts. We will pursue the following specific aims to accomplish our goal:\r\n1.\tMetagenomics: Evaluate the gut community of the lower termite Reticulitermes flavipes by sequencing DNA extracted from the entire community and analyzing those sequences.\r\n2.\tSignaling: Identify key signaling molecules and the organisms they interface with and examine the functions that they control.\r\n3.\tModeling: Carry out mathematical analysis to determine the signaling network?s structure and control processes.\r\n4.\tEngineering: Develop a microfluidic culture array mimicking the microhabitat of the R. flavipes gut allowing physicochemical control and real time monitoring.\r\n5.\tIntegration: Establish, maintain, and control a functional termite microbiome in vitro.\r\nIntellectual Merit. The transformative nature of this work lies in developing an understanding of the termite gut signaling network and using it to engineer a chemical production platform. A significant leap in engineering knowledge will be realized through the development of the artificial termite gut and our ability to rationally manipulate its microbial population. The microhabitat?s population will be manipulated by the introduction of appropriate signal molecules into its feed stream or through disruption of natural intercellular signals.\r\nBroader Impacts. The proposed research will address a national need by laying the groundwork for a new biofuels development platform. Our long-term strategy is to develop the microhabitat array for use in processing lignocellulose to a biofuel or to an intermediate compound for biofuel production, such as feedstock for other microorganisms capable of ethanol or butanol production. Additionally, we will carry out a number of outreach activities, including high school teacher training initiatives and local radio broadcasts about the research.  To reach a wider audience, and to provide educational supplements, podcasts will be developed along with workshops & presentations at local museums. An iPod/iPad application and PC educational video game/educational tool about building an in silico functional termite microbiome will be created and made freely available in both English and Spanish. All computer code will be open sourced and made freely available.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe long-term research goal of this project was to develop a better fundamental understanding of the inter-kingdom signaling that is prevalent in the termite gut microbial community.  This understanding would allow for the development of engineered systems for both the processing of lignocellulosic material and the biomimetic production of socially and commercially relevant chemicals.  A great deal of scientific knowledge and engineering insight was gained in pursuing these goals.\n\n \n\nFirst the gut community of the model lower termite R. flavipes using a metagenomic approach was analyzed.  Using this approach, we carried out the first truly comprehensive analysis of the various members of the microbial gut community.  We identified the major organisms involved in the community and how they responded to various types of environmental variations specifically focusing on different food sources.\n\n \n\nWe identified some key signaling molecules, specifically the BspA-like molecules.  These molecules do not diffuse through the gut.  Rather they are attached to the surface of an organism and become activated when complementary signaling molecules on other organisms make physical contact with them.  Given the dense and crowded gut environment, it was not a surprise to see this type of signaling mechanism employed versus a diffusion-based system.\n\n \n\nMathematical analysis to determine signaling network structure and modulate functionality was carried out.  Specifically, artificial neural networks were developed to understand what microorganism affected what other microorganisms and how the population dynamics of the community changed over time.  This approach ultimately allowed us to start making predictions about community dynamics over time given different sources of food.  It also provided insights into community structures of microbiomes in general.\n\n \n\nA microfluidic culture array mimicking the microhabitat of the R. flavipes paunch allowing physicochemical control and real time monitoring was created.  While initially, a mask system was used to make the microfluidic device, the advent of 3D printing over the course of this project allowed for the faster and cheaper (by two orders of magnitude) creation of microfluidic habitats.  Additionally, novel methodologies for the creation of gold-plated sensors were developed to carry out micro-sensing of the microfluidic environment.\n\n \n\nFinally, a prototype of an artificial environment to maintain and control a functional termite microbiome in vitro was developed.  At the beginning of this work, the microbiome could only be sustained for hours outside of the termite gut.  Based on this research, it is now possible to sustain the microbiome for weeks to months.  The work on the microhabitat is on-going.  However, it is now possible to culture the microbiome in the microhabitat, albeit for brief periods of time.\n\n \n\nGenerally speaking, the objective for the various research goals were met up to the point of the final prototyping step.  Those efforts remain on-going but they are progressing in a positive direction.\n\n \n\nOver the course of this work, several outreach efforts have been undertaken, including radio interviews, natural history museum demonstrations, and development of a website (http://www.kennethnoll.uconn.edu/nsf-termite-project/index.html) which includes instructions on how to build a termite farm.  The work has also drawn the attention of artists from around the globe who were interested in termite mound sculptures.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, several students have been trained over the course of these efforts, including two post-doctoral researchers, 14 graduate students, 14 undergraduate students, and one high school students.   It is worth noting that half of the graduate students involved were female and 10 of the undergraduate students were female.   As part of the program, the life science students and the engineering students rotated through each other?s labs to enhance their interdisciplinary training.  Over the course of this work, 19 peer review publications were generated and approximately 50 invited seminars/conference presentations were made by the research team.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/24/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ranjan Srivastava"
