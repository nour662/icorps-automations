The primary focus of the meeting will be on areas in which Professor Keen has had a major involvement, specifically complex dynamics, Teichmuller theory, and Kleinian groups. All three remain central and extremely active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.",
