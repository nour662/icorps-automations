Post, PI)\r\nThis project comprises a four-year, passive warming experiment of low-Arctic tundra vegetation at a long-term study site in Greenland, with the primary aim of measuring the response of plant roots to warming, and the role of this response in ecosystem carbon exchange.  Phenology, the annual timing and progression of events such as aboveground plant growth, is a well-studied an important component of the ecology of climate change, but remains under-studied belowground.  This study will estimate and compare above- and belowground responses of plant phenology to warming and their respective contributions to ecosystem function, specifically the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and tundra.  It will furthermore determine which plant types, e.g., shrubs or grasses, show the greater belowground response to warming and contribution to ecosystem carbon exchange.  \r\nNovel insights into the expected response of the Arctic to climate change will emerge from this experiment, which will also expand the infrastructure for field-based experimental and observational research in the Arctic.  This research will promote the involvement of under-represented groups by recruitment of students through Penn State?s Minority Undergraduate Research Experience program, and promote education and dissemination of its results through a summer field ecology module at the study site and in courses at Penn State and the University of Alaska-Anchorage.  Results will also be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences by participating students and the Principal Investigators.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to improve our understanding of the drivers and consequences of changes in deciduous shrub abundance in the Arctic, with a particular emphasis on the timing of plant life history events (phenology).  The most important finding to come from our project was the discovery that a longer and warmer growing season may not necessarily lead to greater plant growth and greater uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  While many plant species in our west Greenland study area have responded to warmer springs by expanding their leaves earlier in the season, we found a wealth of evidence pointing to the importance of mid-summer moisture limitation of growth and carbon uptake during warm growing seasons.  Mid-summer moisture limitation was sufficient to at least partially offset greater early season carbon uptake and was associated with reduced annual growth of the two dominant deciduous shrubs in the area.  This is an important finding, because scientists have long thought that cold temperature, low nutrient availability and short growing seasons are the most important factors limiting the productivity of Arctic plants.  Moisture availability has generally been dismissed as a limiting factor.  However, the Arctic is becoming warmer and evaporative demand is increasing.  Our study area in continental west Greenland is among the warmest and driest regions of the Arctic.  In that sense, it can be thought of as a canary in the coal mine.  Our shrub-ring data indicate that moisture began limiting deciduous shrub growth in the early 1990s, at the beginning of a strong warming trend in the region.  Our knowledge of the climate conditions that were associated with the initiation of moisture limitation in our study area will enable us to identify other areas of the Arctic where vegetation productivity may be similarly limited under current conditions and under a range of different future climate scenarios.  \n\nThe University of Alaska side of the project provided support for one graduate student, while also providing field research opportunities for two recent college graduates and one Greenlandic High School student.  Additionally, we assisted in mentoring one of the PhD students at Penn State University.  Results of the project have been disseminated to the scientific community through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national and international meetings.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick F Sullivan"
