Jenkins  EAR-1118297 University of Colorado, Boulder\r\n PI: Potts, Donald C.  EAR-1118306 University of California-Santa Cruz\r\n\r\nCarbonate sediments are deposited extensively in the oceans and are a significant factor in global carbon budgets. But they are challenging to understand because they are created biologically, then modified geologically. Prior to this project, they had been modeled with rather simple rules-based methods which go under the name ?carbonate factory?.  This project takes the next step and directly applies biological principles using advanced numerical modeling on the actual processes ? ?carbonate farm?.  The population and community ecology of carbonate-skeleton organisms such as corals, bryozoans and algae is used to build realistic, detailed 3D time-geologic architectures. This opens productive new research paths into the carbon cycle, ocean acidification, rock properties, oil-gas resources, and environmental responses to global change. \r\nPerceptions that process modeling is not achievable are wrong ? the key is to employ good math tactics on the correct set of processes, for the key organisms, at appropriate time-space scales. In prototype this project has already produced emergent model features such as high-production ?bone yard? ecologies, and correct statistics for the variability of the accumulated sediments. The outputs can be compared even at the core-description level with Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) core logs and oil-industry reservoir variability statistics, promising cross-discipline results.",
