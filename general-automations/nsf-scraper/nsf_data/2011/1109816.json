 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project thoroughly maps the spatial distribution of cold atomic hydrogen gas (H I) in the molecular clouds in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy. The formation of cold clouds from the warm ambient interstellar medium is thought to be a vital step to make molecular clouds, without which star formation would not occur. The PI has developed a method to extract detailed structure data of cold HI clouds from existing high-resolution H I surveys using 21cm-line H I self-absorption (HISA) 3-D shadows. The work provides a census of all cold atomic clouds in the Galaxy that are detectable as HISA shadow clouds, and investigate cloud spatial and velocity distribution, relationship to spiral structure, statistical association with CO emission clouds, and other physical properties (such as H2 molecule formation) in cold, quiescent regions that are traditionally difficult to observe. In order to test competing theories of cloud evolution, star formation, and Galactic structure. The observations are compared to numerical simulations of HISA on scales ranging from small interstellar clouds to whole spiral arms, as the HISA observations probe cloud evolution and large-scale Galactic structure. The extracted HISA data cubes, maps, cloud catalogs, and the analysis tools will be made available to the public at the end of the project.",

This process is ongoing but mysterious: <em>how can ambient interstellar matter -- more tenuous than any vacuum we can create in an Earthly laboratory -- become concentrated enough for its own gravity to pull it together into stars?</em>&nbsp; To answer that question, we need to observe this transition, which probably begins in cold diffuse clouds (CDCs) whose free atoms are moving just slowly enough to start joining together as molecules.&nbsp; CDCs are largely invisible to the human eye but can be detected with radio and infrared telescopes.&nbsp; However, they are less conspicuous than other types of interstellar clouds; their cold atoms and still-forming molecules radiate so weakly that they are sometimes called \"dark gas\".&nbsp; To identify CDCs and determine their properties and origins, we must find ways to bring them out of the shadows.<br /><br />In this NSF-funded project, faculty and students at Western Kentucky University have assembled a large body of radio and infrared survey data covering much of our home Galaxy, applying novel analysis methods to uncover populations of cold interstellar clouds and to assess their physical stages of development.&nbsp; These surveys focus on areas near the plane of the Galactic disk, where the majority of suitable interstellar material is found.&nbsp; CDCs should contain mixtures of neutral atoms and simple molecules that are normally observed with radio spectroscopy of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) and carbon monoxide (CO) emission lines at wavelengths of 21 centimeters and 2.6 millimeters, respectively.&nbsp; In addition, about 1% of the cloud mass is in small, solid \"dust\" particles that absorb starlight, heat up, and glow at infrared wavelengths.&nbsp; With some care, the dust emission can be used to track the total amount of material present in the clouds, including any dark gas not evident in HI and CO emission maps (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).<br /><br />Our project uses several HI surveys covering most of the Galactic plane region: the Canadian, Very Large Array, and Southern Galactic Plane Surveys, the Australia Telescope Galactic Center survey, and the Galactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array survey (CGPS, VGPS, SGPS, ATGC, and GALFA; <strong>Figure 2</strong>).&nbsp; CO spectral data were taken from the original and extended Outer Galaxy Surveys, the Galactic Ring Survey, the University of Massachusetts-Stony Brook survey, and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics composite survey (OGS, EOGS, GRS, UMSB, and CfA).&nbsp; Dust emission maps were obtained from the <em>Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS)</em> and <em>Planck</em> all-sky surveys, with the latter also providing supplementary CO maps.<br /><br />The cold and dark atomic gas in many CDCs should appear as HI self-absorption (HISA) against warmer, brighter HI emission behind them (<strong>Figure 3</strong>).&nbsp; HISA features look similar to denser molecular clouds, and some have matching CO emission; others may have dark molecular gas in which CO is still forming.&nbsp; Searching through the HI surveys noted above, we find HISA wherever backgrounds are bright enough to absorb against, but with enhancements where gas is predicted pile up in spiral arms prior to new star formation (<strong>Figure 4</strong>).&nbsp; We also find that HISA positions are more likely to have CO in the inner parts of the Galaxy than in areas outside the Sun's orbit, but when chance cloud alignments are accounted for, most HISA lacks matching CO, regardless of location (<strong>Figure 5</strong>).&nbsp; This suggests we are capturing different stages of cloud evolution, but how can we tell if dark molecular gas is present or not?<br /><br />To decide such issues, we developed a new method to map HISA cloud properties via combined analysis of the gas and dust data, finding temperatures, densities, and atomic/molecular mixes in the range expected for clouds making this transition, with significant amounts of dark atomic and dark molecular gas both present (<strong>Figure 6</strong>).&nbsp; In parallel, we devised a new way to identify CDCs without bright HI backgrounds from their HI emission line shapes and analyze them with CO and dust data in the same manner as HISA features to map their properties.&nbsp;
