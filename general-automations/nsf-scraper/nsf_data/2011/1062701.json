 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Erika Offerdahl and Mukund Sibi at North Dakota State University.  The research projects supported in this site are in a wide range of areas of chemistry, with the unifying theme of \"Molecular Science.\"  Students will be recruited to this site from undergraduate institutions that lack the resources to support undergraduate research, with a focus on the recruitment of female students from primarily undergraduate institutions.  Each summer, the site will support 10 students in a ten-week per summer program.  A sample of the projects that researchers will work on include:  (1)  the use of environmentally benign indium and bismuth catalysts for asymmetric allylation; (2)  the study of the conserved molecular mechanisms that ensure genome maintenance and prevent abnormal cell growth; (3)  the control of photochemistry within nanocavities in water; (4)  the study of student learning in biochemistry; (5) the synthesis and study of new conjugated materials for solar cells and electronic displays  and (6) the exploration of designer templates for bifunctional catalysis.   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including workshops providing training in chemical safety and in using the chemical literature.  Students will have numerous opportunities to present their results in a variety of settings, including an Undergraduate Research Symposium on-site.\r\n\r\nYoung scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide students without significant research experience a chance to conduct cutting-edge research in the chemical sciences with dedicated faculty mentors.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for further study in the chemical sciences, and graduate school, with eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.",

The overarching goal of the program was to create a cohort experience through which undergraduates from primarily non-Ph.D.-granting institutions would develop aspirations to pursue careers in chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, and material science (herein referred to as molecular sciences). Particular emphasis was placed on recruiting students from (a) primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), where access to research opportunities can be limited and (b) traditionally underrepresented populations. \n\n \n\nParticipants worked on cutting-edge research projects representing a broad spectrum of areas within the molecular sciences.  Many of their stories can be read at http://stuffoflife.areavoices.com/category/reu/.  The program was designed to create opportunities for participants to also receive valuable professional development to enhance their skills and/or knowledge about scientific communication, scientific ethics, diversity in science, and careers in science.  Participants disseminated the results of their work at public poster symposia, a web blog, presentations at regional and national conferences, and in peer-reviewed publications.\n\nThe result of the program was that a mentored, cohort research experience and professional development was provided for 37 students (7 more than our target).  86% of our participants came from primarily undergraduate institutions.  73% of our participants were women; 30% of female participants were women of color.  We engaged students in research that would otherwise not have these opportunities, and we were successful at encouraging the participation of a grossly underrepresented group &ndash; women of color &ndash; in scientific research.\n\nThe majority of participants reported increased self-efficacy in science in general and research in particular.  Similarly, the majority reported the intent to apply to graduate school.  At least three of our women of color have continued on in research, two as graduate students.  One of our research participants became a Robert Noyce Teacher Fellow and currently teaches in a high-needs school district, where she can continue to positively affect the STEM pipeline by sharing with her students the flavor of authentic research.  These numbers may seem small, but they represent a significant contribution to human resource development through diversification of the workforce.\n\nThe impact of this program extends beyond just our participants.  Our public blog disseminates science through the eyes of our REU students &ndash; who are a diverse population.  Not only is this science easily accessible for the lay audience, but explicitly shows diverse students engaging in science demonstrating that science truly is for everyone. In years 2 and 3 of our project, we partnered with the NSF-sponsored REU project, Growing Up STEM. In some cases, long lasting friendships were formed between the participants from the two programs.  Many of the participants in Growing Up STEM aspire to be or have become science teachers.  We anticipate that these relationships between budding scientists and future teachers will serve to enrich the experiences of both partners, as well as the trainees and students affected by them. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erika G Offerdahl"
