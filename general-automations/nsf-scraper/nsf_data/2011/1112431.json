 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Ken D. Shimizu of the University of South Carolina will develop rewritable molecularly imprinted polymers.  The approach is to synthesize polymer networks with conformationally restricted functional groups capable of non-covalent interactions.  The networks would be thermally annealed in the presence of a guest, and then the guest would be removed to produce the imprinted network.  The \"memory\" of the network would be erased by heating it at a temperature that enables fast rotation about the restricted bonds.  The broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students, continuing a high school chemical demonstration program run by graduate students in the chemistry department, providing high school students a summer research opportunity in the laboratory, and the potential scientific and technological impact of programmable polymers.\r\n\r\nThe research will further our understanding of how an \"imprint\" of a molecule can be rendered chemically within a material and how that imprint can later \"recognize\" the molecule selectively.  This work could lead to improved methods to remove impurities from pharmaceuticals or environmental contaminants from water and to improved chemical sensors that would provide faster and more accurate results.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has developed a new class of stimuli-responsive polymers with molecular memory.  Like other stimuli-responsive materials, our new programmable polymers can change their recognition properties when heated with different solvents and guest molecules.  However, these stimuli-induced molecular properties are preserved or ?saved? when the polymers are cooled to room temperature.  These \"programmable\" polymers are based on N-arylimide molecular rotors that will only rotate when heated.  These molecular rotors are rigidly fixed within a highly crosslinked polymer framework.  The orientation of the recognition groups on the rotors change on rotation leading to an attenuation of the their molecular binding properties.  The dynamic write, erase, and rewrite properties of these new polymers can find applications as programmable stationary phases, sensors, writing surfaces, and reprogrammable surfaces. \n\nAdditional outcomes include a better understanding of the factors involved in predicting the solid-state conformation and packing structure of molecules.  These include the correlation between solution and solid-state structures, the importance of dispersion interactions, and new mechanisms for controlling the interconversion of molecular shapes.  This could have importance in predicting the solid form of pharmaceuticals, which is critical for controlling the bioavailability and release rate.  Finally, molecular versions of the programmable polymers were developed using the individual molecular rotors.  These have applications as molecular memory devices that can store information with much higher densities than current silicon chip based devices.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ken D Shimizu"
