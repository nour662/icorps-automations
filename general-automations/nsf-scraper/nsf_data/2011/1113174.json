 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will attempt to resolve inefficiencies in the processing of health insurance claims. A total of 8.3-18.1 billion transactions, including eligibility verification, claim submission, etc., are performed annually in healthcare with only 30-50% of them being electronic.  These paper-based transactions in claims processing result in system-wide inefficiencies which lead to inaccurate claims assessment, delayed settlements, losses due to fraud, litigation, regulatory non-compliance.  The proposed innovation brings to bear a newly-emerging set of health-care IT standards coupled with the ubiquitous cellular mobile platform to provide an integrated solution throughout the payer-consumer-provider healthcare value chain. \r\n\r\nThis project proposes to mitigate inefficiencies in collaboration with a health insurance company that is a thought leader in claims processing, by integrating innovative mobile technology and applying it in a manner that circumvents any significant reworking or replacement of existing claims processing systems. Health care costs are approximately 16% of GDP, and represent a meaningful drag on our nation?s economy.  If this proposed approach is successfully deployed, it promises to address a significant barrier to the efficient delivery of healthcare with the United States.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report:  Mobile Green Mobile Health Card\n\nSummary:  Intellectual Merits\n\nMobile Green, Inc. (MGI) proposed to integrate existing mobile platform technology with claims processing APIs to allow a text-messaging (SMS) enabled mobile device to serve as a virtual health insurance card.   We sought to develop a solution for the problems that are a direct result of the profound inefficiency in US Health Care Payments and Communications Systems. The complexity of US Health Care is particularly reflected in its IT systems, which pre-date the web and mobile technologies, and often are written in fortran or cobol. They are not interoperable in the majority of cases, which harms not only financial returns to health care providers, but also compromises the health outcomes of patients.\n\nBriefly, invalid or outdated health insurance information is costly both for the provider and insurance company; Mobile Green\u00c6s proposed solution is beneficial for both parties by reducing the number of bad claims processed. The potential savings for the Health Insurer alone would be greater than $2 million a year.  Additional savings were also likely to providers.  This would be achieved by delivering patient eligibility information directly to the patient\u00c6s phone using SMS, in response to an SMS request by the patient.\n\nDuring the Phase I period, we achieved the following results:\n\nIntegration      with BCBS Nebraska\u00c6s eligibility systems, which also allows us to check      eligibility on any Blue Cross customer from any state.\nFull      integration with a test site on scheduling; partial integration on billing.\nConception      of a scalable and efficient method to maintain state while using SMS as a      trigger for workflows executed; validation of the latter in a simulation      environment.\nRelationships      with two alpha customers who have agreed to set up pilots \nIntegration      of the alpha customer database with eligibility checking\nDevelopment      of a rich web application that automates the task of eligibility checking      before appointments and generates a report that makes focusing on      ineligible patients easy. Statistical evidence for almost a month of      operation shows that 5.7% of appointments were for ineligible patients.       This was detected before services were rendered instead of after the      fact, which had been the norm.\nSession      tracking in SMS. The conceived method was tested in a simulated      environment and yielded positive results as it awaits testing in a      production environment. \nClear      identification of further commercial applications, beyond patient      eligibility, that take advantage of a technology with a strong presence      (SMS).   These features are in line      with the direction of MGI\u00c6s business strategy and are anticipated to      create an even more appealing offering to providers.\n\nAppointment       reminders which ought to result in reduced missed appointments\nBilling       reminders, which should result in a reduction of the average time in       accounts receivable\nMedication       reminders, which should result in better medical outcomes\nMedical       Condition Management, which should result in better medical outcomes\nConsent via       SMS which should add to laboratory efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n Summary &ndash; broader impacts: \n\nAs Health Care Reform changes the market, the economics of all players in the Health Care System will be altered.  Many providers, particularly Rural and Urban clinics, operate on very narrow margins, and will need to be more rigorous about their own business practices in order to continue providing services to their underserved communities.  Our alpha test in a rural community in Western Nebraska identified a material opportunity to retain revenue; annualized , this revenue is equivalent to two nurses\u00c6 salaries.\n\nBy using a universal mailbox for Health Care communication, Providers will optimize their communication with their patients on F..."
