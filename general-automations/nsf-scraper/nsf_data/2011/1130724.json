 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this collaborative project by University of Connecticut, University of Tennessee and Tennessee State University is to create new theories and a potentially transformative technology to effectively control the gear system-induced vibration propagation.  In gear systems, multi-tonal vibrations are induced as a result of parametric variations in tooth mesh stiffness caused by kinematic variations in the number of teeth in contact and tooth flexibility.  In this project, we plan to develop a multi-layered, hybrid control methodology to enable multi-tonal vibration suppression of parametric time-varying gear system dynamics via simultaneous passive isolation and active control.  Specifically, we will develop bi-periodic extension-twist coupled piezoelectric / composite struts with tunable frequency stop-bands to block high frequency vibration propagation, and in the meantime employ the piezoelectric transducers in the struts to realize a dual-loop adaptive feedforward / time-varying feedback control strategy based on Floquet decomposition that provides active suppression of self-exited vibrations.  With these innovations, the new methodology will rigorously address the major challenges in gear system vibration control, e.g. wide spectrum multi-tonal vibrations, time-varying dynamics with parametric excitations, and non-stationary responses. \r\n\r\nGears are critical components in many energy, aircraft, automobile, and marine/ship systems.  If successful, the outcome of this research can lead to not only increased durability, reliability and efficiency of those systems, but also improved human operating and living environment.  Particularly, reduction of gear-induced vibration and associated noise emissions can play a critical role in wind energy development.  By carrying out the educational tasks, the PIs will disseminate the research findings through classroom teaching, community outreach, and involving under-represented and minority group students in capstone projects, thereby contributing significantly to workforce training.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The goal of this project is to develop a new methodology that can tackle the challenging issue of gearbox-induced vibration in wind turbine systems.  At University of Connecticut, our efforts are focused on 1) fundamental modeling, analysis, and diagnosis of gearbox dynamic characteristics; 2) development of passive blocking of high-frequency vibration propagation using dual periodicity of piezoelectric circuitry and composite and development of damping techniques suitable for harsh conditions; and 3) experimental correlation and validation.  Throughout this project, we have accomplished the following significant outcomes:\na)  A comprehensive and accurate dynamic model of gearbox system is obtained with a newly developed hybrid modeling strategy that combines first-principle theory and actual measurements.  The model can be effectively used for gear vibration control investigations. \nb)  An effective gearbox diagnosis approach is established.  This approach integrates together model prediction and feature extraction/highlighting algorithms, and is capable of providing gearbox health status information that can guide the subsequent control actions to realize the balance between load mitigation, vibration suppression, and system functionality.\nc)  Theoretical investigation of periodically arranged piezoelectric transducer with circuitry synthesis has proved the existence of multiple frequency stopbands that are tunable.  Based on this finding, the proposed passive blocking of high-frequency vibration propagation can be realized.  That is, we can tune the electrical circuitry to effectively block the vibration propagation from gearbox to the surrounding environment.  The piezoelectric transducers can be used simultaneously to realize active control.     \nd)  Analytical and experimental investigations on enhancing the electro-mechanical coupling of the piezoelectric transducer and on nonlinear internal resonance successfully demonstrate the multi-frequency wide-band energy manipulation capability.  The combination of vibration isolation and energy harvesting can result in more effective suppression of gear-induced vibration.\ne)  A new damping technique that is particularly suitable to wind turbine gear system vibration suppression is created.  Combining the tuned mass damper concept with the particle damping concept, we can obtain significant energy dissipation under harsh and time-varying conditions.\nOur progresses encompass the gear vibration modeling and diagnosis, hybrid actuator design, vibration isolation and energy harvesting, and passive damping.  These successfully address the research issues outlined in the proposed research.  The modeling and analysis results are shared with the collaborating partners to explore adaptive feedback control.  \nThe research progresses made in this project have alsoutilized in advancing industrial analysis and design.  The gearbox modeling approach has been successfully integrated into the analysis of electrical impact wrench.  The testbed developed and the theory/algorithms have been adopted in class instruction.  The research progresses have been disseminated through conference presentations and through university open-house events to promote increasing the durability, reliability and efficiency of industrial systems including renewable energy systems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jiong Tang"
