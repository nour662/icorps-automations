 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit. Seeds storage reserves, such as oils, proteins, and sugars are essential for plant reproduction as a source of nutrients and energy during seed germination. Seed composition is a genetically malleable trait that has been, and can be further, modified to our advantage. The seed crop domestication process has involved the selection of varieties containing different amounts of storage reserves primarily for nutritional purposes. Now, and for future needs, the genetic potential of seeds is being tapped as a source for industrial chemicals and biofuel. The goal of this research program is to identify the specific genetic regulators that determine seed composition in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana by using modern experimental and computational approaches. This research will lead to a deeper understanding of specific cellular functions and metabolic processes that underlie the accumulation of seed storage reserves.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts. From the practical point of view, the outcomes of this project will provide the basis for controlling seed composition in Arabidopsis (e.g. to produce more oil or protein) and crops optimized for future economic needs (biofuels and oil-based chemical feedstocks) beyond the traditional nutritional needs of humans and domesticated animals. From the educational point of view, high school students will be provided with research opportunities via the Partnership for Research and Education in Plants (PREP)program to enhance student interest and involvement in science. PREP targets diverse ethnic groups. Students participating in this program tend to improve dramatically in critical reasoning by asking basic biological questions, designing and executing experiments, and interpreting results. Involvement in this outreach program will provide a direct connection between research laboratories and high school science education and thereby contribute significantly to the improvement of scientific literacy in our society.",

We studied an Arabidopsis <em>val1</em> mutant, which had an incapacitated VAL1 gene, resulting in a 12-% increase in seed protein content compared to the wild type that has a functioning VAL1 gene.

Embryo development consists of several distinct stages, involving the action of genes specific to each stage. Developing wild type and <em>val1</em> embryos in stages relevant to SSC accumulation are shown in Figure 1.
