 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developers and researchers at the University of Michigan and the State University of New York, Buffalo are engaged in a project to design materials and an accompanying support system to enable the development of expertise in the teaching of mathematics at the elementary level.   The project has four main components: a set of online professional development modules; practice-based assessments; a set of resources for facilitators; and web-based technologies to deliver module content to diverse settings.  Three modules are planned: one focused on fractions and one focused on reasoning and explanation designed by Deborah Ball, Hyman Bass and the University of Michigan development team; and one on geometry developed by Douglas Clements and Julie Sarama at the University of Buffalo, State University of New York.  Each module is organized into ten 1.5 hour sessions.  \r\n\r\nEach module goes through a two-year design and development process that includes initial design, piloting, revision, and dissemination. Modules are piloted in a variety of settings, including university based courses for practicing teachers and district based in-service activities. These contexts include face-to-face professional development, real-time distance learning, and combinations of the two. Data are collected on participant engagement with the modules, on teacher classroom practice, and on mathematical knowledge for teaching.\r\n\r\nThe modules and associated materials will be widely available and will be free to schools. The materials can be imported into any learning management system, such as Blackboard, Moodle, and others.",
