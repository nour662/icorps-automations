 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this project, the Chemical Synthesis Program is funding Professor Barbara Zajc of the Department of Chemistry at City College of The City University of New York to further develop methodology toward the regiospecific installation of vinylic fluoride functionality in diverse molecular settings.  Such studies are of fundamental interest to the fields of bioorganic and medicinal chemistry, owing to the value of fluorinated functionality, particularly in enhancing metabolic stability and permitting molecular tracing and imaging, by NMR and PET-techniques, respectively. The approaches to be taken include the exploration of new fluorinated Julia-Kocienski reagents, including bidirectional approaches, and those carrying resident chiral centers.  A modification of the Shapiro reaction is also under development as a complementary entry into vinyl fluorides.\r\n\r\nSince organofluorine compounds have seen broad applications, from pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, to NMR probes in structure-activity studies, to PET-imaging agents, this research is expected to have a wider scientific impact.  The broader impacts also involve training of a diverse student population, in a research group setting at CUNY that includes undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers.  Prof. Zajc will continue her outreach activities to local high schools and programs outside The City College that aim to provide students with hands on laboratory experience.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe physical, chemical, and biological properties of organic compounds can be substantially altered by replacement of hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms.  Fluorinated organic compounds are, therefore, of wide interest in diverse areas, most notably in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and as materials.  A recent review on fluorinated pharmaceuticals indicates that about one quarter of currently marketed pharmaceuticals contains fluorine atom, and this is in marked contrast to the approximately two percent about four decades ago.\n\nIntroduction of fluorine atom into organic molecules is a challenging task.  Among the many approaches to fluorinated organic compounds, one approach is to build smaller molecules that contain a fluorine atom, and then assemble these smaller fluorinated building blocks to diverse fluorinated organic molecules.  We have been involved with development of methods for synthesis of fluorinated organic molecules using Julia-Kocienski olefination.  Julia-Kocienski reagents are used to give a class of compounds, known as alkenes.  In this context, we have developed a general approach to fluorinated Julia-Kocienski reagents, key building blocks for the synthesis of fluoroalkenes, and we have studied their chemical reactivity.  Several fluorinated Julia reagents can be prepared from a common precursor.  Additionally, we have been able to prepare advanced reagents from simpler building blocks. These types of approaches allow for rapid modification of multiple parts within a molecule, with specific placement of fluorine atom.  Our comparative chemical evaluations contribute to better understanding the effect of fluorine atom on chemical reactivity.  We have also developed a modular approach to fluorinated polycyclic aromatic compounds, with specifically placed fluorine atom.  Fluorinated aromatic compounds are of interest in materials and in supramolecular chemistry, for example in liquid crystalline materials, organic light-emitting diodes, and organic field-effect transistors.  Further, in the biological realm, fluorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are of interest in studies leading to an understanding of cancer causation. Fluorine atom can influence metabolism of molecules and, therefore, their biological effects.  We have shown that fluorine atom influences the shapes of fluorinated aromatic hydrocarbons, which in turn can affect their properties and applications.\n\nThe City College of New York (CCNY) has a diverse student population, and many are under-represented in the scientific workforce.  NSF funding allowed students at all levels, i.e. undergraduate, masters, doctoral students, and postdoctoral associates to participate in contemporary research, and acquire state-of-the-art skills necessary for successful careers.  Most of PI\u00c6s former students have gone on to successfully continue with their careers, either in the academic setting, or in the private sector.  The PI\u00c6s research program has continued to attract a number of minority students (African American and Hispanic), and a significant proportion of females.  Several of these female students are pursuing the Ph.D. degree, and while in the PI\u00c6s laboratory they have received CCNY and/or national awards.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barbara Zajc"
