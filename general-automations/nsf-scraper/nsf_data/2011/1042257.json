 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to develop and deploy new lidar technology that would enable simultaneous observation of wind and temperature in the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere.   Specifically, a sodium double-edge magneto-optical filter will be designed and integrated into the receiver of an existing sodium Doppler lidar.  This effort will extend current narrow-band resonance wind-temperature lidar capabilities, which are based on scattering by atomic constituents in the mesosphere, by accommodating scattering by aerosols and molecules at lower altitudes.  The new measurements of wind and temperature, extending from the ground to 50 km and from 80-105 km, will facilitate improved understanding of the structure and dynamical coupling between the lower and middle atmosphere.",
