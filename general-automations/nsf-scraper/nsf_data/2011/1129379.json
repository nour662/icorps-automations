The overarching theme of the workshop is to address the current status and future prospects of the astronomy and astrophysical research in the Antarctic. The workshop attendees will: (a) briefly review the history of astrophysical research from the South Pole, with emphasis on why the kinds of observations currently being pursued came to dominate, and the suitability of the site for other observations; (b) summarize the current on-going projects (IceCube, SPT, CMB polarization) and their results to date and expectations; (c) summarize other astrophysical research going on in Antarctica - the long-duration balloon program from McMurdo and the new installations at Domes A and C; and (d) discuss plans and visions for future generations of experiments at South Pole and at remote sites supported from South Pole.",
