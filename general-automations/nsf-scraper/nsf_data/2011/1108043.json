  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes (EAPSI) program gave me a wonderful opportunity to live and work overseas during a portion of my graduate studies.  It also gave me the opportunity to be Principal Investigator on my own research project, not a freedom many graduate students have.  The goal of my research project was to develop a new method of monitoring the manufacturing phase of polymer matrix composites, which could facilitate important improvements on the safety and reliability of composite products, namely aircraft and sea vessels.     \n\nMy gracious host was Professor Woong Ryeol Yu from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Seoul National University in Seoul, Republic of Korea.  For one summer, I had the experience of living in the campus dormitory with a Korean roommate and working with Korean researchers day in and day out.  I also traveled to the city of Changwon to do experimental work at the Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS) and to meet with the research professionals there from the Composite Materials Group. \n\nAlthough the majority of the research project was not fully completed while in Korea, and despite the challenges of working in a foreign country, I believe the experience benefitted me and my hosts greatly.  My host and one of his students had been hosted at my laboratory at the University of Delaware, so my participation in EAPSI was a kind of exchange between our two laboratories.  I expect the exchange to continue and our collaborations and friendships as well. \n\nTo date, an abstract has been submitted and accepted for a conference paper.  The results of the proposed research project will be published in June of 2012 in the conference proceedings of the Society for the Advancement of Materials and Process Engineering (SAMPE) conference in Baltimore, MD.  The positive results of the EAPSI program are undeniable.  I and fellow participants have made working contacts and friendships that will continue throughout our professional careers.  International collaboration works. \n\nThank you NSF!\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kalon L Lasater"
