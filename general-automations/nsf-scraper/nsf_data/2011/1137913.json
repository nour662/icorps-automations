 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award allows the American Psychological Association, in collaboration with the US National Committee for the International Union of Psychological Science, to sponsor U.S. scientists to attend the International Congress of Psychology (ICP) in Cape Town, South Africa. The ICP is a premier international scientific congress in psychology, held approximately every 4 years since 1889. The ICP attracts 6,000-10,000 psychologists, spanning a wide range of scientific psychology and spanning the globe. It offers an excellent venue for showcasing the work of U.S. psychological science, for exposing U.S. psychological scientists to cutting edge ideas being discussed around the world, for fostering a broader international perspective on research and theory across the discipline, and for facilitating international collaboration and exchange. \r\n\r\nEarly career scientists and graduate students whose research is within the purview of NSF will be given priority for sponsorship. The program will include mentoring and mentor-matching activities to strengthen the capacity building aspects before and during the congress and in later follow-up activities. The emphasis on young scientists strengthens the discipline and fosters the development of U.S. science and scientists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award is being co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and SBE/BCS.",
