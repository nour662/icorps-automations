 "awd_abstract_narration": "1066817 (Hester) This research focuses on the restoration of small-scale water (hyporheic) exchange between streams and their underlying sediments (i.e., the highly reactive ?river?s liver?), which has been heavily impacted by various human land uses. The overarching goal is to determine how the potential for ?hyporheic restoration? varies along an urbanization gradient in particular because considerable stream restoration efforts already occur in urban areas. To accomplish this, hyporheic-relevant conditions within 10 stream reaches will be examined relative to urbanization in their contributing watersheds. The specific research objectives are to: (1) quantify watershed-level urbanization metrics for each watershed via existing digital sources: (2) measure reach-scale controls on hyporhic exchange (or surrogates) at each stream via field campaign and existing digital sources; (3) identify relationships between each reach-scale control on hyporheic exchange and urbanization using statistical analyses; (4) quantify hyporheic impairment relative to designated reference conditions; and (5) conduct feasibility assessment of stream restoration and riparian/watershed restoration and riparian/watershed restoration to mitigate hyporheic impairment along an urbanization gradient.  The PI will integrate the research into a new water sustainability component of a Water Resources Engineering class, including involving students in analysis and presentation of results, as well as tours of restoration sites. Similarly, the co-PI will develop learning modules for a Green Engineering course. The PI will work with the School of Engineering?s Center for the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity to recruit underrepresented undergraduates to participate in the project both through semester research experiences conducting data analysis during the academic year and as summer field research assistants.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the last century, increasing use of a variety of chemicals has improved many aspects of human life, but has also lead to pollution of rivers, lakes, and coastal waters.  One widespread example pollutant is excess nutrients such as nitrogen or phosphorous that run off lawns and agricultural areas, which in turn leads to algal blooms, reduced oxygen levels, and fish kills.  Pollutant levels in waterways can be reduced in many ways, for example by reducing use of the chemicals in the first place.  However, direct treatment of polluted waterways is usually also necessary to achieve water quality goals.  Water treatment plants are an important conventional approach to treatment, but they are particularly costly for removing widespread lingering levels of pollution.  Stream restoration is where streams and rivers that have been degraded by human activities such as straightening, lining with concrete, and burying in pipes can be re-naturalized with benefits to aquatic organisms and human recreation.  Stream restoration can also benefit water quality by reducing lingering pollutant levels.  It does this by increasing the exchange of water between the channel and reactive areas next to the channel such as floodplains and shallow groundwater (\"hyporheic\") zones.  These off-channel areas allow river water to slow down, giving it more time to interact with plants and bacteria that can take up or break down pollutants into less harmful substances. \n\nIn the United States, many watersheds are required by the Clean Water Act to reduce widespread pollution from urban and agricultural land.  The Chesapeake Bay region has led the way by giving water quality improvement credits for stream and river restoration practices that increase floodplain and hyporheic exchange.  However, much is still unknown about the effectiveness of specific stream restoration practices to increase floodplain or hyporheic exchange and associated water quality benefits.  This project filled some of those critical knowledge gaps to improve the water quality effects of future stream restoration projects.  The project entailed a series of field and computer modeling tasks that evaluated the effect of stream restoration design parameters, aspects of the watershed setting in which the design would occur, and seasons on the effectiveness of the restoration design to increase exchange of water between the channel and floodplains or hyporheic zones, and thereby improve water quality (typically excess nitrate).  The stream restoration design parameters that we evaluated included the presence or absence of in-stream structures which drive hyporheic exchange; the size, number, or type of such structures installed in a stream; the presence or absence of floodplains along a stream; and the length, width, or number of such floodplain areas recreated or reconnected along a stream.  The aspects of watershed setting that we evaluated included the permeability of the substrate at the bottom of the stream; how large the watershed is that drains to the stream; and the groundwater levels adjacent to the stream.\n\nOur results indicate that stream restoration can, under the right circumstances, substantially reduce pollutant levels in waterways.  However, in unfavorable circumstances, unrealistically long lengths of stream (e.g., many miles) would need to be restored to have a significant effect.  Whether the circumstances are favorable or not depends heavily on watershed setting, particularly groundwater levels and sediment permeability, which often had more effect on water quality than did specific engineering design parameters.  This indicates that where the stream restoration work occurs along a stream or within a watershed is often more important than the specific design.  This implies that it is more important to \"shop around\" for the right location to do a stream restoration project than it is to do an ambitious and detailed design.  Putting this knowledge into practice will often require a shift in paradigm for watershed management, because many stream restoration projects are currently located where land happens to be easily available.  To make stream restoration for water quality highly effective, it will often be necessary to do larger scale planning and coordinating of projects at the watershed level.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erich T Hester"
