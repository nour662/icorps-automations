The focus of this meeting is on advancing phytochemistry research by bringing together the established and upcoming scientists in the field. This meeting is anticipated to attract a broad range of researchers from both the United States and worldwide. The Society has a long tradition in the study of plant biochemistry, chemistry, and natural products (e.g. food and fiber sources, commodity chemicals, renewable energy, nutraceuticals), and this meeting will address major topics in the field, including: Biofuels and Bioengineering; Metabolism and Metabolomics; Biosynthesis; Transcriptome Profiling.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe Phytochemical Society of North America has a tradition of supporting young scientists (including undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) to attend their meetings and make presentations.  This meeting will continue that tradition by providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, women and members of underrepresented groups in phytochemistry to present their research findings and exchange ideas with scientific colleagues, including leaders in the field.  The PSNA Young Members Committee has a program whose topics are focused on enhancing the skills and career advancement of junior researchers.",
