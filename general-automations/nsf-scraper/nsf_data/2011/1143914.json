CCC is the primary conference for research on computational complexity, i.e., the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, conference attendance has been around 100, and around 30% have been students.  The conference's technical content and professional networking opportunities are particularly valuable to students.  Because the next meeting is outside the U.S., students with accepted papers may have difficulty attending.  This award will provide partial support to approximately ten student attendees to defray costs of registration fees, shared hotel rooms, and travel.",
