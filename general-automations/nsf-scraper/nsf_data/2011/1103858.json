 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPrecise acid copolymers are novel materials having functional groups spaced exactly evenly along a linear polyethylene.  For example, a phosphonic acid group can be placed on every 9th, 15th or 21st carbon.  The proposed project involves nine precise acid copolymers and one random acid copolymer having carboxylic acid and phosphonic acid groups with mono- or geminal-substitution.  These materials have established synthetic routes.  Winey's morphological studies of the acid copolymers will use X-ray scattering, HAADF STEM, and electron diffraction to establish the crystalline structure of the polyethylene segments and the nature of the acid group assemblies.  The acid copolymers will be neutralized with Li, Na, Cs, and Zn to form partially- and fully-neutralized ionomers in which Winey will probe the size, shape, spatial arrangement, and composition of the ionic aggregates.  The precision of these acid copolymers and ionomers is known to yield remarkable uniformity in the morphologies, making data interpretation and comparisons with simulations more rigorous.  The dynamics and mechanical properties will be studied for the first time in three precise acid copolymers and one random acid copolymer, along with their ionomers.  The property measurements will include melt rheology, small-strain compression testing to explore elastic deformations, and large-strain, cyclic compression testing to study plastic deformation.  The PI's group has highly specialized expertise to study the morphology, dynamics, and mechanical properties of these remarkable polymers in terms of both demonstrated prior work and existing collaborations.  \r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe PI will study an extraordinary set of functional polymers with the ultimate goal of knowing how the functional groups are arranged and thereby how their arrangement dictates their mechanical properties.  These functional polymers have an acid group on every 9th, 15th or 21st carbon atom along a polyethylene molecule.  The unprecedented precision in these molecules will lead to better structural order at both the micro- and nanoscale, which, in turn, enable improved correlations between molecular structure and properties.  The PI has established collaborations with synthetic chemists, spectroscopists, and theorists to explore these remarkable materials, and within this interdisciplinary team the teaching, learning, and training of more students and researchers will be significantly enriched.  These precise polymers are based on polyethylene, which constitutes the largest class of commercial polymers.  This project involves the first dynamical and mechanical property measurements of these materials and in so doing will evaluate their commercial potential.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPolyethylene is the most common plastic in the world and is used in a wide variety of applications from milk jugs to recycling bins to pipes for natural gas.  With a modest amount of chemical modification (3 &ndash; 15%), polyethylene becomes a specialty plastic with better chemical resistance and higher toughness.  This chemical modification (namely copolymerization) attaches acid or ionic groups to the polyethylene molecule and these functional groups tend to cluster or aggregate at the nanoscale.  These aggregates of functional groups transform the commodity-grade polyethylenes into superior plastics for more demanding applications including medical packaging, golf ball coatings, and perfume bottles. \n\n \n\nThis project has asked what are the design rule for making a polyethylene that enables the next generation of applications &ndash; particularly, applications related to water treatment and energy storage.  These applications require water or ions to move through the plastic, while blocking other molecules from passing.  Our approach to this challenge has been to use a very special set of polyethylenes to better understand the nature of the aggregates, so that we can manipulate the aggregates to improve properties.  The special polyethylenes have the functional groups evenly spaced (rather than randomly spaced) along the molecule and these precise polyethylenes produced much better-defined aggregate structures. \n\n \n\nWe have identified a variety of new structures in these precise polyethylenes and the design rules associated with generating this structures.  When the spacing between the functional groups is long enough, the functional groups assemble into layers.  When the functional groups are particularly bulking, the functional groups form spheres and exhibit long range order.  When the spacing between the functional group is short and the functional groups are large, the aggregates can from stringy and branched aggregates that can span the entire sample.  Relative to spherical aggregates, these percolated structures are particularly interesting for transporting water or ions through a plastic membrane.  These two structures are analogous a highway system that only had beltways (spherical aggregates) as compared to the interstate highway system (percolated aggregates).  Driving across the country is much easier using the interstates and we anticipate that transport will be easier with the percolated structures. \n\n \n\nThe graduate students educated by working on this research project developed and mastered sample processing and structural characterization methods.  Moreover, because this project was made possible by vibrant collaborations with a chemistry group and a computer modeling group, the graduate students were exposed to a wider range of expertise through regular phone calls, frequent email exchanges, and at least annual face-to-face meetings.  This level of interdisciplinary teamwork is excellent professional development.  The graduate students also guided undergraduate students doing research.  Finally, an American company has introduced a new line of polystyrene-based plastics that contain functional groups and we have applied our understanding of and characterization tools for functional plastics to assist their product development.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen I Winey"
