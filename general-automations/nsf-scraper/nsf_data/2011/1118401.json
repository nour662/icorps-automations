 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Einstein Equations have seen extraordinary developments in the last few years, such as results on the formation of black holes, investigations into the uniqueness and stability of the Kerr solution, and advances in our understanding of cosmic censorship, quasi-local mass, deformations of initial data sets and properties of marginally trapped surfaces.  Highly fruitful connections with other geometric PDE's, such as Yang Mills, wave maps, the Yamabe equation,  various parabolic flows, as well as connections to other nearby areas, such as harmonic analysis, have led to an array of exciting new discoveries. This activity has attracted many geometric analysts to the wealth of problems and potential applications of the geometrical techniques developed.  The special session on Mathematical Relativity organized by the PI's at the fifth conference on Complex Analysis and Dynamical Systems in Akko, Israel, May 22 to 26, aims to gather leading specialists and younger researchers in mathematical relativity and geometric PDE's, to discuss these problems and recent results in order to promote collaborations and further progress.\r\n\r\nWith the advance of several experimental projects on relativistic gravitational physics, it is highly important todevelop a wealth of theoretical models.  In order to assure that mathematical relativity continues to have a strong impact on, and interaction with, the experimental efforts, these models should mature and be able to make quantitative predictions on a number of subjects such as gravitational collapse, gravitational waves and other phenomena associated with strong gravitational fields.  This special session will encourage further collaborative research into these topics and also draw young talent to this field.  The participation of graduate students and young Ph.D.'s will ensure the continued vitality of the discipline.",
