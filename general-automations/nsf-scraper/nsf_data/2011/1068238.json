 "awd_abstract_narration": "This STEP Type 1A project is addressing issues of retention and success in science, mathematics, and computing. Based on extensive planning and examination of best practices the PI team is implementing improvements in several areas of the institution's programs, including use of collaborative learning materials, improved identification of at-risk students, introduction of a summer enrichment bridge program, and development of a new program to recruit underrepresented students. A particular emphasis taking place is the encouragement of more women and underrepresented minorities to pursue science degrees. Ambitious goals are envisioned to increase the number of science and mathematics majors by 150 per year and to double the annual number of underrepresented minority graduates with science and mathematics majors, from 55 to 110. Faculty development workshops are also being undertaken with particular attention to strengthening collaborations between a feeder two-year campus and the main institution. The intellectual merit of this project rests in the quality of its strategies and activities and in its formative and summative evaluation on i) changes to introductory courses, ii) academic support and mentoring, and iii) use of quantitative data on student performance and qualitative data from focus groups, to determine factors that influence retention in majors or persistence in career paths. The project is exercising broader impacts through its ambitious numerical goals for increasing the number of graduates in the sciences, mathematics, and computing, particularly among members of groups that remain underrepresented in STEM fields of study. Moreover, the project's approaches offer models for small teaching-intensive two-year institutions, as well as research intensive universities with a strong liberal arts tradition.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the past 5 years the Emory and Oxford College communities have benefited greatly from the NSF STEP funding provided to our Gateways to Success in Science, Mathematics and Computing grant.  This grant, has allowed the Emory community to develop both faculty and students based on the needs outlined in our grant proposal.  In brief, STEP has provided for the development of an engaged, collaborative interdisciplinary group of faculty to come together to better understand the needs of engagement, mentoring and development of interactive curriculum for a diverse background of students.  This was accomplished by initially providing workshops to inform STEM faculty of methodologies and resources for building engaging, inclusive and innovative curricula while providing faculty training in utilizing educational initiatives as a research and career development tools.  These well attended workshops were supplemented by the expansion of a faculty-focused journal club, exploring scientific teaching modalities, evidence-based research opportunities, educational study design and providing networking opportunities for faculty.  Still active, this faculty journal club has allowed for the development and submission of several NSF and HHMI which we anticipate will provide opportunities in both research and instructional enhancements for students across introductory and upper-level courses in STEM.  In addition to faculty-facing efforts, our NSF STEM grant allowed for the development and implementation of a unique summer bridge program, GLUE (Getting A Leg Up @ Emory).  GLUE was designed to engage STEM-interested students who, based on parental education, standardized test scores and GPA, might not have been successful in their introductory STEM courses.  Over the 4 years of the program, 352 students participated in either a traditional residential or online version of the program in the summer before their first year of Emory or Oxford College.  GLUE represented a unique program, not only in the opportunity to participate online or residentially, but also by using a problem-based learning approach to allow students to collaborate, requiring a broad range of scientific skills and interests in order to solve global and local problems based on current issues in STEM.  Our NSF STEP grant provided for the development and/or adaptation of problem-based learning modules which were then adapted to both the online and residential learning environments.  Student participants were required to interact, network and build soft skills in order to be successful in the program, resulting in a strong community of first year students entering Emory &amp; Oxford Colleges over the past 4 years.  This community has continued to grow and thrive both within annual cohorts and, by utilizing a peer-based mentoring system, across cohorts.  Research on these students have indicated that GLUE was successful in raising STEM and cumulative GPAs of participants, over invited non-participants.  We also have noted a greater sense of community among participants, satisfaction with their college experience and greater likelihood to participate in extracurricular and academic-focused opportunities when compared to students that were invited but did not participate in the program.  While our NSF STEP funding for this project has now ended, we are pleased that Emory College has institutionalized several components of the GLUE program and is working to both integrate these components into the resources provided to all students while studying the longitudinal effect that GLUE participation has had on its participant students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/25/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patricia A Marsteller"
