This is a multi-disciplinary workshop that addresses challenges related to visual analysis and simulation of large crowds. The workshop engages complimentary viewpoints from different areas including computer vision, computer graphics, physics-based simulation, and evacuation dynamics to develop additional insight into crowd analysis, modeling and simulation problem. This grant partially supports the travel of invited speakers and participants, especially from computer graphics, simulation, and pedestrian dynamics. The final proceedings of the workshop along with speaker slides would be made available via WWW.",
