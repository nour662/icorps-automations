 "awd_abstract_narration": "The multiphasic chemistry of halogens is known to be involved in a range of chemical interactions in the atmosphere ranging from the O3 cycle, oxidation of hydrocarbons and reduced sulphur compounds, the odd nitrogen and oxygen (HOx and NOx) cycles, as well as involvement in aerosol nucleation, growth and heterogeneous chemical paths. Active halogen reactivity is frequently associated with coastal or marine zones, reflecting the abundance of oceanic halide sources found there. Recent nocturnal observations of the reactivity of a chlorine atom precursor, nitryl chloride (ClNO2) has seemed to predict a surprising continental presence of this pathway, which potentially has implications to our understanding of the global impact of halogens on several of the above species in non-marine settings. Nocturnal ClNO2 arises from the reactivity of N2O5 on particulate chloride, which brings into question how well continental chloride sources including industrial activity, biomass burning, and the transport of wind blown mineral dust are really known.\r\n\r\nSeveral aspects of the above suspected chlorine activation pathways remain to be investigated. This investigation involves a number of university researchers joining with NOAA (ESRL) colleagues on additional characterization of halogen reactivity pathways in continental air masses. Overarching issues to be investigated include: i) quantitative evaluation of halogen photochemical processes in continental air, ii) mechanistic study of the generation and recycling of active halogen chemistry in nocturnal continental air.\r\nThis research has implications for air quality, the natural cycle of halogens in the atmsphere and the oxidative capacity of the air we breathe.",

This intensive field experiment involved scientist affiliated with NOAA and several other academic institutions in the US, Canada, and Germany. \n\nRecent measurements revealed the presence of nitryl chloride at significant concentrations in surface air near Boulder, CO.

Common substances with pHs in the range of 2 to 3 include lemon juice and vinegar.  In the context of this study, aerosol particle pH is important because, as currently understood, reactions that produce nitryl chloride occur only on the surfaces of particles that are acidic.\n\nOur results also revealed that aerosol chloride consumed in the production of nitryl chloride was replenished by uptake of hydrochloric acid from the gas phase.  This recycling mechanism prevented depletion of aerosol chloride thereby sustaining high rates of nitryl chloride production than predicted based on aerosol composition alone.\n\nThese reactions are at the heart of the nighttime chemistry and its impacts on air quality, ozone production, and methane oxidation, which we are only beginning to explore. Results of our investigation helped improve mechanistic understanding of the generation and recycling of active chlorine in nocturnal continental air.\n\nThe project supported a graduate student at the University of New Hampshire who completed a Master of Science degree in 2013 and is now teaching science in a New York City high school.
