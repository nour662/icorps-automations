 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focused on real-time automated data mining of medical videos.  These videos are of increasing importance, particularly in applications such as real-time decision making based on video recordings of networks of blood vessels. The proposed research addresses the real-time knowledge discovery from large volumes of complex video signals, for the generation of predictive models. \r\n\r\nIf successfully deployed, the technology enabled by this effort will extend an area of emerging clinical significance. The effort proposes to specialize a tool towards assessment of tissue oxygenation using real-time automated processing of microcirculation videos. The real-time and fully automated nature of image processing and machine learning methods proposed by this project, places this technology in a strong position in the market, both as a standalone system and as a software package included with imaging hardware.",
