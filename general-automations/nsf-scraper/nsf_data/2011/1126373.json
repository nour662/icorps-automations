Despite technological advances, it remains impossible for a single piece of MS instrumentation to provide all of the information sought in global analyses. As such, all of the centers of excellence in metabolomics utilize pipelines that exploit multiple analytical platforms (e.g., LC-MS, GCEI-MS, GC-CI-MS). The proposed AB Sciex TripleTOFTM 5600 is a high resolution, exact mass MS/MS platform that is specifically designed to provide the resolving power sought by the metabolomics community. This instrument provides a mass resolution of up to 40,000 full width at half height (FWHH) in both positive and negative ion modes, exact mass (1 ppm RMS) with a dynamic range of up to five orders of magnitude, a rapid acquisition rate (20 Hz) that fully exploits the resolving power of UPLC, and absolute sensitivity more usually associated with triple quadrupole instruments operating in Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) mode. In short, this instrument offers speed, accuracy and versatility to explore complex samples from a large user group with diverse needs.",
