 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an observational study of binarity in the central stars of planetary nebulae.  This stage of stellar evolution represents the penultimate phase of evolution for low- and intermediate mass stars, and very little is known about the evolution of binary stars during this stage.  Close binaries are expected to evolve further into merging or mass-transfer systems, which would then manifest themselves as cataclysmic variables; they could also be the precursor systems to Type Ia supernovae.  The project will involve a combination of multi-color photometry and spectroscopy with the aim of discovering new binary stars in planetary nebulae and characterizing some in detail.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the project may have a significant scientific impact on the areas of supernova research, cataclysmic variables, and novae.  It will also contribute to the development and training of students at a primarily undergraduate institution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe end stages of sun-like stars are generally considered to be through the ejection of their outer layers into space as the core shrinks to become a white dwarf.  The ejected gas typically glows, due to the hot core, and is called a planetary nebula.  However, there are still many open questions about the planetary nebula process, the resulting evolution of the core to become a white dwarf, and how these processes might differ when the dying star has a companion star.  In other words, when there is a binary star system.\n\n \n\nIf the two stars are close enough, as one star ages and its layers expand, the two can interact with one another and one possible result is that the companion star and the core of the dying star spiral toward one another, ending up much closer than they were to begin with.\n\n \n\nThis program, funded by the National Science Foundation, explored those types of close binary systems inside of planetary nebulae.  One of the outstanding questions has been the source of some of the exotic shapes and structures we see in planetary nebulae: butterfly  or hourglass shapes, cylinders, barrels, point-symmetric jets, and more.  The primary model has included a companion star (or large planet) that acts to shape the gas as it is ejected from the dying star.  While the model is largely believed and works from a theory standpoint, no systematic study of actual planetary nebulae had been completed.  As part of this project we performed that study and have showed that for eight known planetary nebulae, the binary star system and the shape of the nebula align with one another and that the probability of this happening only by chance is one-in-a-million.  This is the first clear indication using data that close binary stars do relate directly to the shapes of their surrounding planetary nebulae.  See Figure 1 which shows the relationship between the close binary systems and their surrounding nebulae.\n\n \n\nTwo other parts of the study explored how companion stars might change the evolution, or life-cycle, of stars like the Sun.  The typical scenario has a star like the Sun using up all of the hydrogen in its core and expanding to become a red giant star.  Then it begins to fuse helium in the core and when all of that is used up, expands again to become an asymptotic giant star.  After this phase, the outer layers are ejected and we see a planetary nebula.  However, a nearby companion can actually strip away the outer layers of the dying star early, causing the star to skip the asymptotic giant stage entirely.  In these cases it is not clear whether we will observe the ejected layers as a planetary nebula.  While such stars have been observed before, none have been discovered inside of a planetary nebula.  This study found two very strong candidates for these \"post-red giant\" stars.  While they have not yet been confirmed as post-red giant stars, follow-up studies are underway.\n\n \n\nIn addition to the two results mentioned above, the study has resulted in the additional discovery of nearly two-dozen new close binary stars inside of planetary nebulae.  Work on some of those systems was completed as part of this study, while follow-up studies on many of the others continues.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Todd Hillwig"
