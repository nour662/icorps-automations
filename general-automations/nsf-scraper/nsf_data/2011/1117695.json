 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crystallographic lattices are nature's way to partition space into uniform cells with high symmetry. The equilateral triangulation of the plane, the face-centered and the body-centered cubic lattice in 3D and the lattice based on the 24-cell in 4D, all partition space more isotropically than the commonly-used Cartesian grid. Higher isotropy means higher efficiency, in that sparser data allows reproducing the same functions as data on the Cartesian grid. To take advantage of this increased efficiency, for material, medical, biological and even algebraic computations, we need to explore and make practically accessible multi-variate `crystallographic' splines that honor the structure of the crystallographic lattices. \r\n\r\nWith emphasis on dimensions 3 through 8, where the number of spline coefficients is still manageable, this research seeks to derive efficient analogues of the computational tools, data structures and algorithms that are currently available only for tensor-product splines on Cartesian grids. This includes algorithms and data structures to support quasi-interpolation for reconstruction, evaluation of functionals, refinement and adaptive subdivision, multi-resolution in the presence of singularities, conversion to localized polynomial form,  and treatment of structural singularities. As proof of concept and extensions in their own right, these tools will be tested on multi-variate algebraic real-root finding, error-bounded approximation of level-sets, generalized subdivision and the computational formulation of partial differential equations.\r\n\r\nDissemination of the underlying theory, algorithms and coded examples will lower the barrier for the use of crystallographic splines and thereby enable more efficient computing for simulation and modeling. Progress in real root finding will benefit applications from  geometric constraint solving to charting molecular conformation spaces. Finite elements based on crystallographic splines will honor boundary data when solving differential equations on crystallographic lattices. The impressive structure of crystallographic lattices \r\nwill engage undergraduate and graduate students in digital arts and computer graphics classes; and videos  of volumetric fly-throughs and projections from higher dimensions will make this research accessible to the wider public.",

While the tensor-product Cartesian grid is widely used together with well-established families of functions, crystallographic partitions, such as the equilateral triangulation in 2D, the face-centered cubic lattice in 3D and 24-cell partition in 4D offer a more uniform (isotropic) partition. Higher isotropy means that less data, sampled on these sparser lattices, allows reproducing the same functions as data on the Cartesian grid. To take advantage of this increased efficiency for material, medical,&nbsp; biological and even algebraic computations requires multi-variate splines that honor the structure of the crystallographic lattices. With emphasis on 2D through 8D space, this research derived and completely characterized efficient symmetric box-spline constructions on crystallographic lattices that exist in any number of dimensions. For each box spline family, the basic properties for computational use were discovered: continuity and polynomial degree, the linear independence of shifts on the lattice and optimal quasi-interpolants for fast approximation. Remarkably, box-splines were shown to be quite unique in providing multi-resolution spaces nested under refinement for the crystallographic lattices.<br /><br />Irregularities in lattices are of concern as sites of material weakness or as a meeting point of several regular lattice regions. The new findings extend the classical spline theory for bivariate surfaces to include such irregularities, for example points where three or more than four quadrilateral facets come together. Such quad-meshes now have an associated space of piecewise polynomial functions, one G-spline per mesh vertex, that extended tensor-product splines to a unified structure that captures basic shapes of aesthetic design and cover multi-sided regions with continuity of curvature while minimizing oscillations of curvature, measured via highlight lines. A highlight of this development was to rigorously prove that such G-spline always yield isoparametric elements of high smoothness over domains with irregularities in any number of dimensions -- as is needed to solve higher-order partial differential equations. Concrete constructions of C1 finite elements on non-tensor-product 2D and 3D manifolds showed how these G-splines can serve both as domain (surface) and analysis space (elastic deformation). Complementary, for incorrectly non-smooth Discontinuous Galerkin computations, a newly-developed theory now provides explicit formulas that improve accuracy and smoothness with super-convergence under refinement. Nonuniform Discontinuous Galerkin Filters via Shift and Scale defines families of simple, optimal formulas that make one-sided boundary convolution stable. Besides the algorithms, the research community now has access to a carefully selected obstacle course for modeling and thin shell simulation in the presence of irregularities.<br /><br />Also of immediate impact, adopted by Boeing, is a technology that determines the correct resolution so that spline surfaces shows neither polyhedral artifacts nor parametric distortion on a finite resolution, pixel-based display. That is, the new tight estimates allow automatically setting the tessellation factors on graphics processors (GPUs) to render with near-optimal efficiency and full accuracy.<br /><br />The grant supported in part the research work of four PhD and three MS students.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/03/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jorg&nbsp;Peters</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1117695/1117695_10119056_1483320901826_slab--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1117695/1117695_10119056_1483320901826_slab--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"box-splines via projection\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1117695/1117695_10119056_1483320901826_slab--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"box-splines via projection\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Orthogonal projection of unit cubes along the diagonal direction in 1D and 2d</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Minho Kim, Jorg Peters</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jorg&nbsp;Peters</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">box-splines via projection</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1117695/1117695_10119056_1483321528830_14bi234--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1117695/1117695_10119056_1483321528830_14bi234--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Irregularity in quad mesh surface\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1117695/1117695_10119056_1483321528830_14bi234--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Irregularity in quad mesh surface\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Input:  one planar and four cylindric pieces.
