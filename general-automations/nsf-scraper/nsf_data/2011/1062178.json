 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to Texas A&M University that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 8 students during each of the summers of 2011- 2013.  This REU Site program (Expanding Scientific Investigation through Entomology) will: 1) provide a complete scientific research experience that includes building skills in analytical thinking, quantitative analysis, research ethics, and written and oral communications, 2) improve integration with society to increase abilities to communicate the relevance, appropriate detail, and significance of projects to the public, and 3) increase diversity in the student population studying entomology and conducting related research by recruiting and performing outreach that attracts women, underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities, and veterans returning from active duty.  REU students will conduct independent research projects with one of the faculty mentors representative of the Department's intellectual, cultural, and gender diversity.  Research experiences will be supplemented with integrative activities such as campus-wide REU science discussion groups and social activities, research discussion meetings, workshops in developing effective oral and written presentations, experience developing sound experimental design, and sessions to introduce and/or review quantitative methods in basic and applied entomological research.  Students will also gain experience with specific laboratory and research techniques such as biochemical analyses, DNA sequencing and extraction, analysis of gene expression, molecular marker development, physiological and toxicological bioassays, stereomicroscopy, compound microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy.  Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool.  More information is available by visiting http://insects.tamu.edu/reu/, or by contacting the PI, Kevin Heinz at kheinz@ag.tamu.edu, or the Program Coordinator, Rebecca Hapes at rhapes@tamu.edu.",

It should be noted that the REU-EXCITE program preferentially selected students from non-research one institutions, meaning applicants seldom had any previous exposure to entomology.  Of the 24 students who participated in the REU-EXCITE program over the three years of this award, 71% were female, 37.5% were non-white.  To date, 33% (N=8) of the program participants have graduated with BS degrees. Of those students, 75% (N=6) are pursuing graduate degrees, and of those six, 83% (N=5) are pursing graduate degrees within STEM fields.

This resulted in students developing social media pages (http://www.facebook.com/pages/TAMUs-REU-EXCITE-EXpanding-sCientific-Investigation-Through-Entomology), blogs  (http://tamubugworld.wordpress.com), and Science U 101, interactive presentations to diverse high school-aged students who visited the campus of Texas A&amp;M University.\n\nThe REU-EXCITE program and the personnel associated with it have been recognized within the Texas A&amp;M University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences for their efforts with innovative educational programs.  Dr. Kevin Heinz, PI and Ms. Rebecca Hapes, Program Coordinator, were awarded the Vice Chancellor\u00c6s Award in Excellence for Diversity in January 2013 and the Dean\u00c6s Outstanding Achievement Award for Excellence in Educational Enrichment and Innovation in 2012.
