This effort is a collaboration between Prof. Antal at University Of Hawaii (UH) and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NUST). At UH, the biomass will be converted to bicarbon at different pressures and temperatures, and will be characterized at NUST using SEM, TGA and XRD (common tools for material and structure analysis). Using bench top combustor at NUST the combustion of bicarbon and it's characteristics will be examined. \r\n\r\nThe UH students will gain an unique experience with their time split between UH and NUST, working in two different countries and two different group of advisors. Their research experiences in the two countries will be unique and complementary, with production of the bicarbon at UH and characterization and combustion of the bicarbon at NUST. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the research stems from the fact that the structure, properties and burning behavior of bicarbon as a function of its initial processing parameters such as pressure and temperature are poorly understood. The proposed study will undertake a systematic study of the dependence of characteristics and combustion of bicarbon as a function of the pressure and temperature used to produce the bicarbon. \r\n\r\nBicarbons or charcoal can be used as an environmentally benign substitute for coal as a reducing agent in the manufacture of silicon and ferro-silicon. They can also be used instead of coal for power generation, space heating and combined heat and power applications without the deleterious emissions characteristics of pulverized coal plants. Potential benefit to enhance agricultural plant growth is also cited. Since bicarbon is produced from biomass they can be considered to be carbon neutral. Thus, success and understanding of bicarbons can have significant benefits from sustainability and environmental viewpoints.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCarbon Substitution and Sequestration (CarbSS): Project Outcomes\n\nMichael J. Antal, Jr., Principal Investigator\n\nThe production of silicon requires charcoal (i.e. \"biocarbon\").  Thus biocarbon is a key ingredient in the manufacture of all the cellphones, laptop computers, photovoltaic panels, and related solid state silicon devices employed by mankind.  This insight evokes the realization that biocarbon production is a foundation stone of modern civilization.\n\nThe production of iron, steel, and many other metals can employ biocarbon as the needed reductant; but because of cost, coking coals usually are used instead.  During the year 2000 the iron and steel industry alone was responsible for 5.8% of global CO2 emissions due to its use of coking coals and other fossil fuels.  To fight climate change we can substitute electric power from wind, PV panels, solar and geothermal power plants, hydroelectric stations and other renewables for fossil transportation fuels, but only biocarbons can replace coking coals in the sustainable production of silicon and metals.\n\nFurthermore, biocarbon (i.e. activated carbon) is employed worldwide to render water potable, and biocarbon is the most widely used cooking fuel in the world.  Also, the use of biocarbon as a soil amendment can benefit plant growth as well as sequester carbon; thereby fighting climate change.  In view of all this, it is difficult to imagine a more important biofuel than biocarbon.\n\nBiocarbon was the first synthetic material produced by man.  It was also the first nano-material synthesized by man.  Despite 34,000 years of experience with the manufacture of biocarbons; prior to the research supported by this NSF grant, the technology of biocarbon production was remarkable for its inefficiency (i.e. its waste of wood, nutshells, and other biomass).  As a result of this NSF grant, we now know the conditions required to realize 100% of the 2nd Law thermodynamic efficiency governing the manufacture of biocarbon.  At present we employ these conditions in laboratory-scale reactors.  Our aim is to transition our lab reactors into commercial scale equipment.\n\nBecause this NSF grant sponsored an international collaboration with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), it has had considerable impacts on the development of human resources.  My students Mr. Gregory Specht, Mr. Sam Van Wessenbeck, and Miss Charissa Higashi have earned or will earn their MSE degrees in Mechanical Engineering (ME) from the University of Hawaii (UH) as a result of this project.  Likewise, Mr. Specht, Miss Higashi, and Miss Kathryn Hu (who will graduate this spring with a BSE in ME) gained valuable international experience as summer research assistants at NTNU.  Also, Dr. Liang Wang, who earned his PhD at NTNU and now has a permanent position at SINTEF in Norway, benefited from our collaboration as he is first author of two publications that have arisen from our joint work, and co-author of others together with my students and me.\n\nIn addition to the outcomes listed above, this NSF grant enabled me to spend 6 weeks working with NTNU and SINTEF researchers in Trondheim, and 2&frac12; months with chemists of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS) in Budapest, who collaborate with the Norwegians and UH on biocarbon research.  During this time I assisted the Norwegians with the preparation of a proposal to the Norwegian Research Council to continue and expand the biomass carbonization research initiated by this NSF project.  Our proposal was accepted and funded at a level of 20,263,000 NOK for four years beginning in the fall of 2014.  This Norwegian project (\"BioCarb+\") will support continuing work at UH, and continuing collaborations of NTNU and SINTEF researchers with UH faculty and students and HAS researchers and students.\n\nIn conclusion I thank Dr. Maria Burka, Ms. Bonnie Thompson, Dr. Sumanta Acharya, and Dr. Sohi Rastegar (all of NSF) for their interest in biocarbons, and the National..."
