 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Argumentation in the Middle School is an exploratory project that is working in collaboration with teachers to increase their knowledge of mathematics for teaching in middle school.  In addition to geometry and algebra, the professional development is focusing on the role of mathematical argumentation in the middle school and strategies for increasing argumentation. The research component of the project is providing insights into how teachers use their mathematical knowledge to increase argumentation in the classroom and to help students build skills in mathematical argumentation.  In addition, the project is studying student outcomes such as reasoning, communication skills, and mathematical knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe project researchers are using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to ensure that they have high quality data and analysis that will provide insights into the following research questions:  1) How do teachers use what they learn from the professional development (PD) experiences when they teach in the classroom? 2) To what extent does teachers? use of the project materials and what they learn in the PD result in mathematical argumentation in their classroom discourse? 3) Do students gain conceptual understanding of the mathematics as a result of their participation in argumentation in the classroom? Based on previous research, there is adequate evidence to believe that argumentation in the classroom does increase for participants in the workshop, but the researchers are seeking a better understanding of how teachers use their knowledge and the project materials to enact such an important change in mathematics lessons and in student learning. The professional development uses the dynamic software Geometers' Sketchpad, a carefully-designed, geometry curricular unit, and student materials to help teachers see how to set up a classroom environment that supports mathematical conjectures, arguments, and discussion.  The research is done in the classroom and assesses the various components of the professional development in promoting argumentation.\r\n\r\nThe project is providing insights into how teachers use their mathematical knowledge to implement changes in the classroom.  The project is creating effective professional development strategies, a middle school curriculum unit on geometry that emphasizes argumentation, and associated materials.  The research is explaining how teachers use their knowledge and the materials and providing information on how students' conceptual knowledge develops through argumentation.",
