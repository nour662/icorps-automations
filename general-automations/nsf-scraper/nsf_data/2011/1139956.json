This meeting, which is co-sponsored by the International Association of Hydraulic Research, will facilitate exchange of the latest findings and approaches relevant to diverse phenomena including stable atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers, river- and hurricane-induced floods, flow through riparian-zone vegetation and associated hydrological processes, and transport of contaminants by these flows.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this activity derives from exchange of information focused on the improvement of experimental and eddy-resolving numerical techniques necessary to investigate large-scale quasi two-dimensional coherent structures and their role in the transport of mass, heat and contaminants in the geophysical environment.  Broader Impacts will occur through improved assessment and forecasting of near-surface meteorological, hydrological and ecological processes and associated socio-economic impacts (such as those from flooding), and by furthering the educational development and diverse representation among students and early-career researchers.",
