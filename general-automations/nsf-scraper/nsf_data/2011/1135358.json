This approach is grounded in and flows from extensive empirical evidence that standards of conduct depend as much or more on the work environment than on participation in isolated courses or online tutorials. \r\nThe four project objectives include: 1. Consensus Conference to develop a framework to build a curriculum for Capacity-Building Workshops. 2. Curriculum Development for the Workshops.  3. Capacity-Building Workshops. 4. Outcome Assessments: Revise and finalize the Workshop curriculum based on feedback from faculty participants and their graduate student trainees. \r\n\r\nThis project will pilot the proposed workshops in 8 public and 7 private graduate institutions, including 3 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  To foster approaches responsive to the globalization of the research community, the proposed Expert Panel includes a member with extensive academic connections in China, and Chinese graduate students will be among those assisting with key aspects of curriculum development. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts will derive from the activities, outputs and outcomes of this project and will enhance graduate ethics education for STEM graduate students while promoting the development of a diverse community of researchers better prepared to model the highest standards of scientific conduct. Results of the project will be promptly and widely disseminated through workshops conducted by participating faculty, established research ethics websites as well as the new National Center for Professional and Research Ethics.",
