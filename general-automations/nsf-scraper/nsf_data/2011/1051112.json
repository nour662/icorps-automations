Participants will include leading international statisticians and survey methodologists with expertise on the measurement of and adjustment for nonresponse bias; principal staff on major social-science survey projects; and representatives of major governmental and nongovernmental survey research organizations such as the US Census and Statistics Sweden. Workshop participants will have expertise in conducting cutting-edge research on nonresponse bias, directing social-science research programs, and managing major large data collections. Workshop sessions will include presentations summarizing and synthesizing the latest research on nonresponse bias, outlining the state of research on the topic and best prospects for further development, and identifying specific recommendations for both research and application. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe workshop will produce a research agenda to test and refine the promising techniques that have already been identified to address nonresponse bias.  It will also produce recommendations of the optimal ways that current best practices can be utilized to detect and reduce nonresponse bias.",
