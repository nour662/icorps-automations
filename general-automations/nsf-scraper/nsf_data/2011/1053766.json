 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator (PI) has developed a tomographic technique that uses data from multiple lines-of-sight at a single observing location to reconstruct the three dimensional plasma density and velocity distribution of coronal mass ejections and co-rotating plasma structures in the heliosphere. In this effort, the PI will apply his tomography technique using real-time heliospheric observations from Japan's Solar-Terrestrial Environment Laboratory, white-light observations from the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) spacecraft, and interplanetary scintillation (IPS) radio data from the Ooty Radio Telescope in India and other observatory sites in Mexico and Russia. The PI also anticipates the availability of similar radio data during this project from the NSF-funded Murchison Widefield Array radiotelescope being constructed in Western Australia. Using ground-based and space-based data, he plans to determine the global heliospheric plasma configuration, to reconstruct the shapes of plasma structures observed remotely and in situ, and to evaluate and refine his tomographic analysis technique. Finally, the PI will incorporate solar wind models including magnetic fields into this tomographic reconstruction of solar wind velocity and plasma density. \r\n\r\nThe PI notes that his tomographic analysis technique provides an entirely new way of viewing interplanetary space from Earth and will have a broad impact on the field of solar-terrestrial physics. This investigation will directly impact space weather predictions by making visible the difficult-to-depict region of space between the Sun and the Earth. The heliospheric plasma reconstructions produced by this tomographic method result in colorful images and movies that are easily accessible to the layman, and provide a valuable tool for research and education.",

This SMEI website includes direct images with a long-term base subtracted, orbit difference images made from these, and low-resolution 3D reconstruction images and planar cuts. We have also upgraded and modified the 3D reconstructions to provide much higher-resolution 3D analysis of the IPS and SMEI data at Earth. A great advance was made in the SMEI auroral-removal program during the middle of this contract period that now allows the aurora to removed from the whole SMEI image data set so that four million valid lines of sight in a Carrington rotation can be used in the SMEI tomography. This amounts to up to half of each SMEI image allows far finer resolutions to be retrieved from the SMEI data than was possible in the past. A new version of the tomography code that is currently operated to provide low-resolution SMEI tomography products at UCSD has also now been operating at the CCMC to provide these same data products with their interactive software.\nThese analyses make visible the entire heliosphere in 3D, and as such provide an easily understood view of the three-dimensional heliosphere in velocity, density, and magnetic field. They provide an accurate representation of these parameters at Earth and globally throughout the interplanetary medium, and are also used to forecast the arrival of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and structures that corotate with the Sun at planetary bodies and heliospheric spacecraft. As a forecast tool they are used at different world Space Weather Centers to warn of impending communication outages, and the disruption of society that depends on sensitive modern electronic equipment and spacecraft communications.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/29/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bernard V Jackson"
