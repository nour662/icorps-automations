The objective of the conference is to stimulate US-German international research collaborations in the area of bioinspired design and engineering of novel functional materials.  This will be the sixth in a series of DFG-NSF Research Conferences, a series conceived and promoted by the immediate past-Director of NSF and his counterpart at the DFG.  The conference will be held at the German House on United Nations Plaza, which houses the offices of the German Government in New York City.  The structures found in nature are admired for the elegant way that material is matched to function.  Recent advances have begun to reveal the strategies used by living systems to create the materials from which these structures are built.  It is now realistic to consider new approaches to design and engineering of functional materials that are inspired by the lessons learned from biological structures and the means by which they are created.  The emphasis will be on the formation of functional synthetic materials using biological, biomimetic, and bioinspired templates, approaches, or pathways.  The longer-range goal is to create robust routes for the synthesis of materials with novel combinations of properties or possessing functionalities that are unachievable by conventional means.  This work calls for an interdisciplinary approach involving close collaboration among scientists from a broad range of disciplines including biology, chemistry, physics, and materials science and engineering.  In addition, the use of state-of-the art genetic and computational methods and processing and characterization approaches is essential to transferring the understanding of fundamental principles into the successful creation of novel functional materials.  \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  The longer-term societal outcomes expected from the conference include development of new functional materials that can be achieved by mimicry of biological systems and processes.  A broader impact specific to this conference is the opportunity to foster US-German scientific collaborations.  The program has been specifically designed to promote informal discussions among the participants as they seek to identify potential collaborative partners.  The program is designed to maximize opportunities for informal discussion of possible collaborations, and the conference is organized without parallel sessions so that all participants have an opportunity to be exposed the full range of activity represented in the presentations.\r\n\r\nSUPPORT:  This conference is supported jointly by the MPS/DMR Biomaterials Program, the MPS/DMR Office of Special Programs, the ENG/CBET Biomedical Engineering Program, and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering(OISE).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis proposal was for support of the sixth DFG-NSF Research Conference that was held in New York City in March 2011.  The objective of the conference was to stimulate US-German international research collaborations in the area of bioinspired design and engineering of novel functional materials.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nBiological systems have evolved means to create polymeric and mineralized materials that are exquisitely designed for high functionality in specific applications.  In many cases, the materials of nature display structure-function relationships that exceed our current ability to reproduce in synthetic materials.  Nevertheless, our understanding of these designs and the means by which they are produced is now sufficient to encourage efforts to harness or mimic these designs and the methods used in nature to achieve them.  This conference brought together experts in the field of bioinspired materials and engineering to share recent advances and new methodologies.  It is anticipated that trans-national collaborations will emerge from the conference that will advance both research and education in this area in both participating countries.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe establishment of new US-German research collaborations was the primary goal of the conference.  As an outgrowth of such new collaborations, the existing expertise in each country can be leveraged through international partnerships that bring new insights and methodologies to bear on the research questions of interest.  A collateral benefit will be the creation of new opportunities for international exchange of students, who will benefit both from the new techniques learned but also from a better understanding of the differences and similarities of the US and German scientific and academic communities.  The organizers endeavored to involve many younger scientists and scientists from groups underrepresented in the STEM workforce in the conference.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy J Deming"
