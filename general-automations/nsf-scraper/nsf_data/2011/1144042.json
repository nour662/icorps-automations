 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work of the proposed Message Passing Interface Forum addresses the continuation of activity focused on enhancing the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for passing data between processors in distributed computing systems built from heterogeneous multi-cores, for parallel remote file operations, and for dynamic process control of such parallel applications. The current standard provides a core of routines used for point-to-point and one-sided data exchange, blocking collective communications routines, remote parallel file access and dynamic process control. In addition, these are augmented with support for features such as derived data types, communications contexts, process groups, and virtual process topologies. \r\nThe work of this forum will produce a communications standard suitable for addressing the needs of parallel applications on the next generation computing facilities at the petascale level and beyond.",
