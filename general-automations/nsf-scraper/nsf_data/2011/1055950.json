 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this engineering education research CAREER award is to understand how various aspects of motivation affect the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills for engineering students. These skills are commonly understood as important in preparing students for the ever-changing global challenges engineers must face. In order for students to effectively apply their intellectual resources in their educational experiences, they must be motivated to do so. Educators must understand affective factors in students' development, in particular those that contribute to motivation (e.g. expectations, values, goals, and attitudes) as well as their cognition and academic performance. Past research has addressed the affective and cognitive domains independently, but there has been little focusing on how affective factors that feed motivation are related to both the cognition and learning experiences of engineering students. Understanding these relationships will address the greatest challenges facing engineering educators: increasing interest in engineering, creating a more diverse engineering workforce, and preparing students for a future of rapid technological change and globalization. \r\n\r\nSpecific research goals are to 1) identify and understand factors that contribute to engineering students' motivation to learn and succeed, and compare these against different student types (by demographics, choice of major, etc.), 2) correlate students' prior knowledge and motivation with the development of their problem-solving and critical thinking skills, and track changes in these correlations over time, and 3) develop an amalgamated motivation theory for undergraduate engineering students grounded in the data. A robust instrument to assess engineering students' motivation throughout the undergraduate experience will be developed to translate research to practice. The education component of the project will focus on training engineering graduate students and educators in underlying theory and use of the instrument.",

Educators must understand affective factors in students&rsquo; development, in particular those that contribute to motivation (e.g. goals, expectations, values, and attitudes) as well as their cognitive achievements.</p>\n<p>We examined the future time perspectives (FTPs), self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies, and the connections between the two for different groups of engineering students. FTP refers to the views students hold about the future and how their perceptions of current tasks are affected by these views and vice versa. We have identified three types of FTPs for undergraduate engineering students: students with a single realistic view of the future, conflicting ideal and realistic future views, or open views of the future. SRL connects the behaviors, metacognition, and motivation of students as they learn and has been shown to help students achieve higher grades and graduate at a higher rate. By tying FTP and SRL together, we were able to describe and document engineering students&rsquo; SRL strategies, interactions between engineering students&rsquo; FTPs and SRL strategy use, and describe how goal setting serves as a bridge between FTP and SRL for engineering undergraduates. Students reported that they make direct connections between how useful they think current tasks are in terms of reaching their future goals and their SRL strategy use. Additionally, students with more well-defined future goals reported a higher use of SRL strategies than students with ill-defined future goals. A strong, well-defined set of sub-goals related to a more long-term future goal helped to motivate participants to utilize SRL strategies in their coursework.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Past research on achievement motivation has also shown that the connections students make between their perceptions about their future goals and present academic tasks affect the choices they make about persisting at those goals and tasks. In fact, we found evidence that students with more positive and definitive perceptions of the future (as opposed to their perceptions of what they are doing in the present) are more persistent toward their goals. Part of this research examined the interactions between student motivation and their persistence in engineering majors. Data was collected through a survey we developed (the Motivation and Attitudes in Engineering, or MAE) that assesses undergraduate engineering students&rsquo; time-oriented motivations and how those motivations relate to their perceptions of metacognitive processes and problem solving. The survey had sections related to FTP (perceptions of the future, perceived instrumentality of present tasks, and perceived effects of the future on present tasks), as well as goal orientation (performance approach, mastery approach and work avoid) and expectancy (beliefs about succeeding at a task). Survey responses and the current majors of the students who completed the MAE survey as first year engineering students three years prior were compiled. We then created a statistical model of MAE factor scores to see if they predicted whether or not a student would remain in an engineering or any STEM major. The model showed that a mastery approach was negatively correlated with persistence in an engineering major, and high expectancy and positive perceptions of the future were positively correlated with a student&rsquo;s persistence in an engineering or STEM major. These findings provide evidence for educators who seek to attract and keep students in STEM majors who might otherwise be inclined to leave, namely students whose goal is to master the material, who question their likelihood to succeed in their major, or who do not have clear, positive perceptions of what their future in STEM will be. The methods and findings also have implications for research in terms of understanding how important and relevant FTP and goal orientation theories are in engineering, and how these theories help explain the academic choices engineering students make.</p>\n<p>This work helped us visualize how student motivation plays out in the classroom and beyond, even to the point of explaining whether or not students will persist at long term goals. Overall persistence at long term goals is explained in part by the interactions between task-specific motivation, future-oriented motivation, and different aspects of learning in engineering. Task-specific motivations include how useful a task seems to be and whether a student is focused on learning (mastery approach) or getting good grades (performance approach). Aspects of learning include persisting at tasks when solving a problem, and applying knowledge from one topic or course to another, also called knowledge transfer. Knowledge transfer is one of the ultimate goals of education, and is affected by how persistent students are at both short-term tasks and long-term goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/02/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lisa&nbsp;C&nbsp;Benson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1055950/1055950_10066721_1522298163460_FinalOutcomesGraphic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1055950/1055950_10066721_1522298163460_FinalOutcomesGraphic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student Motivation and Learning in Engineering\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1055950/1055950_10066721_1522298163460_FinalOutcomesGraphic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student Motivation and Learning in Engineering\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overall persistence at long term goals is explained in part by interactions between task-specific and future-oriented aspects of motivation and student learning in engineering.
