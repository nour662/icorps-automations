  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPharmaceuticals in Our Water:  A New Zealand Perspective\n\n \n\n            Every time someone takes a prescription or over-the-counter medicine, only a portion of the drug is metabolized by their body.  The remainder is excreted in active pharmaceutical form and makes its way through a sewage treatment plant to natural bodies of water, and eventually perhaps to our drinking water supply. \n\n            For the past four years, I have studied the behavior of various pharmaceutical compounds in water.  I began by focusing on the fluoroquinolones, a set of antibiotics commonly taken by both humans and animals.  I studied their degradation under gamma irradiation, measured their rate constants with hydroxyl radicals and hydrated electrons, and identified several byproducts that are formed when they break down in solution.  Then, I shifted to a set of three antidepressants, which are also widely utilized by patients.  For this study, I focused on photochemical fate, attempting to understand the behavior of the compounds under natural sunlight rather than engineered treatment.  Once again, I obtained degradation rates and identified reaction byproducts. \n\n            This past summer, I had the opportunity to perform research at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, through the NSF\u00c6s East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute.  While I have traveled abroad before, this was the first time I was studying in a foreign country, and I felt apprehensive yet excited. \n\n            Upon my arrival in the country, the Royal Society of New Zealand gave all the EAPSI participants a 3-day orientation, which included an introduction to the local culture, information on the research environment, and general tips on the New Zealand lifestyle.  After this, I arrived in Dunedin and settled down in my apartment, ready and anxious to begin. \n\n            My research at the University of Otago focused on enoxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic.  I utilized an ultraviolet light reactor to degrade the compound, and monitored the concentration as a function of time by high performance liquid chromatography.  This enabled me to describe the degradation kinetics.  I then repeated this process under several sets of conditions, in order to analyze the impact of various factors on the degradation rate.  I discovered that hydrogen peroxide increases the rate of degradation, as does a combination of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ions.  This last condition, commonly known as the photo-Fenton reaction, is a common technique used to produce reactive oxidants that can be used to break down pharmaceuticals and other compounds.  I also obtained a sample of sewage from the Dunedin wastewater treatment plant, in order to study the behavior of enoxacin in real-world conditions.\n\n            In addition, I ran experiments to monitor the total organic carbon in the enoxacin sample during irradiation.  Finally, I identified the byproducts formed during the irradiation process through mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. \n\n            My research, however, was only a portion of my experience in New Zealand.  I also had the opportunity to immerse myself in a foreign culture, meet the local people, and experience a lifestyle surprisingly different from my own.  Besides giving me the opportunity to perform scientific research in a foreign university, EAPSI provided me with a chance to develop new collaborations with scientists from all over the world, and I hope to remain in contact with many of them as I progress through my career.  This program has certainly been one of the highlights of my graduate education.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hanoz B Santoke"
