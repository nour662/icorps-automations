 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to investigate the feasibility of a combined top-down/bottom-up nanomanufacturing method to synthesize a bio-inspired AlMgB14/Ti micro-tool by mimicking, adapting and implementing the nanoscale morphology and analogous structure of nacre in the abalone shell.  A femtosecond pulsed Ti:sapphire laser system in conjunction with molecular beam nozzle and computer generated holographic masking procedure will be used to deposit nanoscale thin films of \"brick and mortar\" nacre layers with angstrom resolution, pattern hexagonal tiles of nacre at high throughput, and nanotexture dimples and bridges. The effects of hierarchical organization of hard AlMgB14 and soft Ti layers on the types of fracture and energy absorption will be determined through a quantitative understanding of energy dissipation mechanisms such as rotation and deformation of nanograins under various types of loading.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the laser-based nanomanufacturing approach will become superior to the time-consuming, cumbersome self-assembly methods for engineering the bio-inspired materials. The implementation of this nacre design will offer significant performance improvements in the micro/nano-tools used for micro-machining, micro/nano-EDM, probe-based nanomachining and micro-coining. Research will contribute to the development of more energy-efficient, cleaner and sustainable society by minimizing power consumption, energy losses and component replacement frequency.  Educational impact will include: develop a hands-on module for K-12 students and host a workshop for students and industry participants on bio-inspired nanomanufacturing; and promote the recruitment and participation of women and underrepresented groups by leveraging several university programs.",
