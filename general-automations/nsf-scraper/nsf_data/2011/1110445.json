 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to identify key factors contributing to the genetic differentiation within a species and the genetic mechanism underlying such differentiation. Using a North America native mustard plant species as model, preliminary study has found significant genotypic and phenotypic divergence between two subspecies. In order to study the genetic mechanism responsible for this differentiation, the investigators will generate a cross between the two subspecies and identify possible genes responsible for the phenotypic differentiation. Also, the direct contribution of genes and phenotypes to adaptation will be measured by growing the plants in their native environments. The investigators will further examine the genome-wide differentiation pattern between the two subspecies. Combining these results, the effect of local adaptation on the pattern of within-species genetic variation will be investigated empirically.\r\n\r\n\tThis proposed research will advance understanding of patterns of within-species genetic diversity. Understanding the extent and driving factors of genetic variation will provide valuable information in various applications, such as identifying genetic factors underlying important traits in various species, including agricultural plants. The proposed project will be one of the first studies identifying possible genes responsible for important phenotypes, investigating the adaptive effect of these genes and phenotypes, and unifying these results with the investigation of population genomic divergence patterns. The utilization of a plant species in this research enables direct experimental manipulation on studied individuals. Finally, several undergraduate students will be trained with the interdisciplinary knowledge of ecology, population genetics, and genomics in this project.",
