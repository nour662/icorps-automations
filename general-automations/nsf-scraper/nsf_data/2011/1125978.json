The Doctoral Consortium (DC) will be held on August 7-8. This award supports travel stipends for 13 US student participants and one-on-one mentoring lunches, a group dinner, and a poster session for all participants. The Doctoral Consortium will extend over two days and will include participant presentations, panel discussions, feedback to the participants from mentors, informal discussions (over lunch and during breaks), a group dinner for students and mentors, and a poster session. Each participant will give a 20-minute presentation that will be followed by 20 minutes of discussion led by an assigned mentor to provide feedback on the research and the presentation itself. To help the participants make the transition from being students to embarking on a research career, there will be a presentation on guidelines for developing a successful research program. In addition, there will be panel discussions addressing issues such as research strategies, job search, publishing, and establishing research funding.",
