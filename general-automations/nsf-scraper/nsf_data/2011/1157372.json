 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, co-funded by the Catalyzing New International Collaboration and Smart Health programs, supports a workshop organized by Naphtali Rishe of Florida International University and  \r\nAnn Liebschutz of the U.S.-Israel Science and Technology Foundation. The workshop on Knowledge Mining and Bioinformatics Techniques to Advance Personalized Diagnostics and Therapeutics is to be held in conjunction with the Up Close and Personalized - Personalized Medicine Congress in Florence, Italy, February 2012. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will foster collaboration in the design and development of bioinformatics tools to analyze and process large quantities of clinical and genomic data. This topic is at the intersection of clinical data-mining, algorithms design and bioinformatics.  As it is well known that one drug does not deliver the same results to all patients, this workshop seeks to spur international collaborations to enable identification of individual genetic differences affecting drug effectiveness, making possible personalized treatment plans that can both improve the quality of healthcare while reducing its cost.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the workshop will seed collaborations between U.S., Israeli, Turkish and Palestinian scientists.  Through the auspices of the Turkish Embassy and Israeli-Palestinian Science Organization, the workshop is intended to bring together a multidisciplinary group of scientists from the fields of computer science, pharmacology, neuroscience, public health, medical informatics and bioinformatics. These future endeavors will build on diverse areas of expertise and technologies in development to improve health care delivery internationally.",

The workshop's scientific steering committee includes Dr. Naphtali Rishe (Workshop Chair and NSF Principal Investigator), Dr. Yelena Yesha (Program Chair) and Dr. Eddy Karnieli (UPCP General Chair). Ann Liebschutz was the Organizational Chair.\nThe workshop brought together a group of 40 medical and computer scientists representing the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories, Canada, Italy, Turkey, the Netherlands and Germany. The workshop included four scientific sessions focusing on the policy implications of implementing personalized diagnostics and therapeutics based on big data analytics, the technological challenges facing computer scientists and physicians in creating useable systems, the challenges in utilizing big data analytics to predict future health outcomes, and the needs of clinicians in utilizing in their practices decision support systems based on big data analytics.\nModerated by Dr. Ron Ribitzky, the workshop concluded by reaching multi-disciplinary and multi-national broad-based consensus on new directions for knowledge mining and bioinformatics tools to impact patient care; as well as strategic, proactive, and preventive health and wellness decisions here and now.\nA multi-faceted, grand-challenge undertaking, the highlights included call-to-action for technological breakthroughs to fill the growing translational white spaces. Among the many scientific and clinical disciplines throughout the personalized medicine cycle up to end-user clinicians, patients, and consumers; business models innovation to accelerate the reduction of new discoveries along that cycle to practice; and policies that facilitate both. Uzia Galil, the founder of the Galil Center for Medical Informatics, Telemedicine and Personalized Medicine at the Technion (Israel Institute of Technology), had this to say about the workshop which he participated in: \"We have today a better cooperation between the Bio-Medical and Genetic Research and the advanced electronic Medical Health records, but we need more workshops of this kind in order to bring again computer scientists and clinicians to come together and lay the groundwork for the future of medicine by providing the relevant information to the general practitioner in front of the patient.\"\nThe group is preparing to deliver the scientific proceedings of the workshop. These proceedings are expected to be published as Springer Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Naphtali D Rishe"
