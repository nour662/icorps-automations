 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will address how lightning is triggered and propagates upward from tall structures such as buildings and towers.  Existing literature and previous observations suggest that nearby flashes can create conditions favorable for upward leader initiation from tall objects.  The objective of these investigators is to quantify and understand these conditions and deter-mine a triggering flash component responsible for upward leader initiation.  A combination of electromagnetic and optical sensors will record upward lightning flashes from multiple transmission towers near Rapid City, South Dakota.  Electromagnetic sensors will include electric field meters, fast and slow field change sensors, and two interferometers.  Operation of these sensors will be coordinated with high-speed video, standard-definition video, and digital still image cameras. Observations made with these assets will be analyzed along with National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) and meteorological data (i.e., radar, satellite, thermodynamic sounding and meteorological surface parameters) to determine types of flashes and their properties that affect or are critical for the initiation of upward leaders from tall objects, storm type, region and stage of development during which upward lightning occurs, and the conditions for triggering upward leaders on multiple tall objects during the same flash.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research is centered upon a more complete physics-based understanding of mechanisms involved in triggering and propagation of lightning channels that are unique to strikes on tall structures.  Broader impacts of this effort will include collaborative interactions with lightning researchers based in Brazil, who will participate in the South Dakota-based field program, through enhanced graduate student and undergraduate-classroom training in the methodology and interpretation of a diverse set of field observations and associated data analysis techniques, and through dissemination of these findings via conferences and in the peer-reviewed literature. Findings from this research will benefit society through increasing understanding of and protection from potentially hazardous effects of lightning strikes to both occupants and equipment mounted on high-rise buildings and other tall structures utilized for telecommunications and energy production.  In addition, presentations related to this research will be made to regional elementary and secondary schools, and service clubs/organizations to increase lightning awareness and stimulate interest in higher education and atmospheric research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research, the use of very high-speed digital video and other electrical sensors to better understand the properties of and causative mechanisms for upward lightning emanating from tall objects is, primarily, basic research.  As such it was not undertaken with the intent of finding any direct benefit to the general public.  However, as we gain knowledge of the origin and behavior of upward lightning, the use of digital imagery provides some interesting results that could possibly benefit and definitely educate the lay person.  A few of these are mentioned below.\n\nAs for the basic science results of this research, analysis of the data obtained during UPLIGHTS supports the hypothesis that upward positive leaders from tall objects are primarily triggered by 1) the approach of horizontally propagating negative stepped leaders associated with either intracloud development or following a positive cloud-to-ground (+CG) return stoke and/or 2) a +CG return stroke as it propagates through a previously formed leader network that is near the tall objects.\n\nAs for possible public benefits, as a result of this research we better understand the type of storms that are favorable for upward lightning.  This gives tower owners with sensitive electrical equipment the opportunity to take precautions prior to potential upward lightning flash events.  Some wind turbine operators now stop turbine rotation during conditions favorable for upward lightning.\n\nThis research substantiates that, as tall objects continue to be built in areas subject to thunderstorms, there will likely be an increase in lightning production (anthropogenic influence on lightning frequency) in that region.\n\nThe use of high-speed digital video recordings of lightning show the general public how lightning behaves in a very clear way.  This improved understanding may translate into improved safety through increased knowledge.\n\nAnalysis of high-speed video along with correlated electric field sensor data has helped address the myths and misunderstandings about lightning behavior such as these untruths;\n\n1. lightning always goes up\n2. rubber tires protect a vehicle from a lightning strike\n3. lightning never strikes the same place twice\n4. positive cloud-to-ground lightning always comes from the upper portion of the cloud\n5. lightning is the development of a monopole/unidirectional leader from a charge region\n\n\nAlso, high-speed video from this and other similar projects has been used by the National Geographic Society in producing episodes of educational programs for their National Geographic Channel, which can impress and educate the public regarding lightning and its incredible variation in behavior.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John H Helsdon"
