The approach is to derive and realize a new generation of power electronics circuits and associated control strategies for a hybrid PV-battery system.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nFirst, a circuit analysis framework for multiple-input converters will be derived.  Based on this framework, the best circuit for battery integration at the PV module level in VLS systems will be identified.  Then, a new breed of SiC-based switched capacitor converter/inverters will be derived.  In particular, a switched capacitor inverter will be studied.  The inverter will have boost function, multiple voltage levels, redundant switching statues, and low voltage stresses on switches and capacitors.  All these new circuits will be implemented in a hybrid PV-battery system to 1) maximize the total power output of all the PV cells, 2) reduce the cost of battery monitoring and balancing circuits, and 3) eliminate line transformers, filters, and centralized inverters for battery packs.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nCalculated from published numbers, the proposed research will create at least $3.4 billion in cost savings per year.  The project will also include a comprehensive education plan: at the K-12 level, a collaborative one-day Solar Energy/Smart grid workshop will be established to reach 2000+ Ohio teachers; a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform will be utilized for teaching activities at both the undergraduate and graduate levels; and a long-term internship program with the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag\u00fcez will be developed.",

The main research contributions of the project include: a family of new switched capacitor based WBG circuits that can integrate multiple dc energy sources into the ac power grid; a new and practical selective harmonics elimination method for high power large scale power electronics circuit; and a multi-physics real-time simulation based hybrid testbed.</p>\n<p>The team had not only accomplished the original goals of this project but also established new research projects that are based on the outcomes of this project. During and soon after the project, the team published 19 journal papers and 32 conference papers that are either directly based on this project or projects that were initiated based on the outcome of the project. One patent is already granted. Two more patents are pending.</p>\n<p>Twelve students including two undergraduate students were trained during the project. Dr. Xiu Yao, who was once sponsored by this project for her research on dc arc in PV strings, has become a Tenure Track Professor at the University of Buffalo. Drs. Mark Scott, Luis Herrera and Mohammed Aloslami, who worked on this project as university and government fellowship awardees, now have become tenure track professors at the Miami University, Rochester Institute of Technology and King Abdul-Aziz University, respectively. Other graduate students, who had worked on this project and graduated, all found jobs in leading companies including Ford, General Electric, Telsa Motors, Texas Instruments, and NextEV. Mr. Rachid Dabali Zamora, an undergraduate student from the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, was sponsored by this project as a summer intern. Because of the experience from this project, he later received a regional award and a U.S. Air Force summer fellowship award. Mr. Markus Sievers, who worked on this project as an undergraduate assistant, now is working as a hardware design engineer at an international automotive company. In total, the students listed above received six conference awards, including four outstanding presentations awards and two student contest awards. Among these six awards, the most notable one was the 1<sup>st</sup> Place Student Hardware Demonstration Award won by Xuan Zhang in the 2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Expo.</p>\n<p>At K-12 level, leveraging support from the Department of Energy, the PI organized a Solar Energy/Smart Grid Workshop in the summer of 2012, during which 25 Ohio high school teachers were trained with industry led lectures, hands-on demonstrations, and lab tours.</p>\n<p>In July of 2013, the PI hosted the IEEE Future Energy Challenge (IFEC). The competition received 21 proposals from 11 countries. Eight teams with a total of 41 team members together with 12 judges, organizing committee members, and 18 volunteers attended the final onsite competition at the Ohio State University. The PI continues to be a major contributor to the competition and now serves as the Steering Committee Chair and the Treasurer for the competition.</p>\n<p>To prompt wide bandgap (WBG) power devices in all types of applications, the PI organized and hosted the 1<sup>st</sup> IEEE Workshop on Wide Bandgap Power Devices and Applications at the Ohio State University in 2013. More than one hundred researchers and engineers attended the workshop. Now the workshop has grown into a leading annual forum for the WBG research community with more than 200 participants a year.</p>\n<p>In summary, with the support from NSF, the PI was able to gradually build a large research program, provide research experience to both graduate and undergraduate students, prompt female and minority students in engineering, train high school teachers,
