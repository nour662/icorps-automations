 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Richard Finke of Colorado State University, for the detailed structural investigation of Ziegler-nanocluster hydrogenation catalysts based on the elements cobalt and iridium. The goal of this work is to understand the true nature of the catalytic species in solution, and to optimize catalyst structure in a streamlined industrial process. A particularly important goal of this research is to determine why a decrease in metal concentration in these catalyst systems leads to an increase in catalytic rate.\r\n\r\nThe practical impact of this research is potentially enormous, given that the major user of these catalysts is, and continues to be, the chemical industry. It is highly relevant to other areas of industrial importance beyond hydrogenation, such as olefin polymerization. Indentifying the actual catalysts and the factors that control their behavior may lead to logical approaches to the improvement and invention of new Ziegler-type catalysts. In terms of broader impacts, this research will expose both undergraduate and graduate students to important industrial processes, which is a rare occurrence in academic pure science environments. The mentoring and training of students in a wide variety of skills, from organometallic synthesis to spectroscopy, is a major feature of this work.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe intellectual merit and broader impact of this NSF funded research project can be summarized as follows: first, the impact is in the general area of chemical catalysis, an area crucially important to our well-being and economy as a quote from Chemistry and Industry  attests: \"The economic impact of catalysis is as remarkable as the phenomenon itself.  Approximately one third of the material gross national product in the US involves a catalytic process somewhere in the production chain.\"  Hence, it is crucial that the US continue to have a strong presence in catalysis, and this NSF funded program is one part of that effort.  Second, important impact was achieved in the training of young scientists needed to support our country, its scientific infrastructure and its economy. Specifically, five graduate students and one undergraduate were trained, resulting in 2 Ph.D. theses and 1 MS thesis.\n\nAs for specific discoveries and outcomes, a more detailed understanding of industrial catalysts that are used for the processing of 375 million pounds per year of block polymers was achieved. That advanced understanding includes discovering the answer to a puzzling report seen at least 8 times in the catalysis literature whereby a lower concentrations of catalyst lead to a higher, faster catalytic reactions&mdash;the opposite of the expected and almost universally observed trend. Our discovery of how this happens has implications for improved industrial reaction by so-called \"Ziegler-nanocluster\" block-polymer hydrogenation catalysts that were discovered under the prior period of NSF support, as well as for all other catalysts displaying this previously ill-understood phenomenon.\n\nAdditionally and importantly, in the new, \"hot\" area of investigation of solar-energy capture and storage, a novel organic-photovoltaic device was constructed that can capture the sun\u00c6s photonic energy and use that energy directly to split water to oxygen plus protons and electrons, the latter being the chemical equivalent of hydrogen fuel.  Also published was what promises to be a seminal paper in determining the actual, \"true\" catalyst for the central water-oxidation reaction in this and related devices.  Knowing the true catalyst is crucial for running and optimizing all catalytic reactions, since industrially and commercially important features of any and all catalysts depend on the true chemical identity and composition of the catalyst.  Those key features include the catalyst\u00c6s rate, total lifetime, recovery and regeneration&mdash;key properties related to the catalyst\u00c6s efficiency and effectiveness.
