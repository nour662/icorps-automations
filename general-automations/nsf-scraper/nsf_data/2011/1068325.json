 "awd_abstract_narration": "Illumination with beams of light in unconventional polarization states departs from the usual, textbook description.  Two popular examples of unconventional polarization states are radial and azimuthal polarizations (sometimes called Cylindrical Vector Beams). A wide variety of unconventional polarizations exist -- some have been well studied, while many remain unexplored. This research activity brings together three investigators that have been studying unconventional polarization states and their mathematical representation, the propagation and focusing of polarized light, and light scattering from small particles such as those found within biological cells.\r\n\r\nThis investigation makes use of a novel mathematical representation (complex-focus basis) for modeling optical focusing and scattering, the study of radial, azimuthal, and Full Poincare fields as representatives of a complex-focus basis, and the scattering of unconventional polarization states from mesoscopic particles, including cell organelles. In the process, we also address the formulation and testing of a theory of partially coherent unconventional polarization states, the coupling of unconventional polarization states to nanostructures, and develop numerically efficient theoretical models for coherent and partially coherent light propagation. We make use of the recently-introduced concept of stress- engineered optical elements to adapt an existing light scattering microscope to carry out polarization- sensitive scattering experiments.   In the process, we are advancing optical physics by introducing new analytic tools for scattering analysis, a new experimental tool for rapid-acquisition pupil polarimetry, and find better ways to use polarization as a tool for improving projection imaging systems such as LCD projectors and semiconductor lithography systems.\r\n\r\nPolarization--the vector nature of light--influences the scattering of light in profound ways, and is therefore fundamental to how we gain information about a scatterer from the scattered light.  This has been used to good result in advancing cell identification for immune cell research, for example. Scattering is also important in the inspection processes that are used to guarantee high quality semiconductor circuits for computers and electronic devices.  A better understanding of the physics of new polarization states will therefore have a broad impact on fields such as optical engineering and biomedical optics.  The educational impact is seen annually through involvement by both undergraduates and graduate students, not merely as research assistants, but as students in training who are encouraged toward independent initiatives.  Our role as educators at the Institute of Optics offers us a unique platform from which to take the results of the work, bring them into the classroom at the MS and BS levels, and to take the exciting features of polarized light with us on educational activities in area schools and science museums.  Our presence at the Institute of Optics offers technology transfer to over 30 companies who are members of our Industrial Associates Program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPolarization&mdash;the orientation of an oscillating electric field in optics and electromagnetics&mdash;is an important property of light.  It is important both in our classical understanding  as well as in the newest advances in coherence and quantum optical physics.  An unconventional polarization state is one that exhibits complexity over space, angular range, or frequency spectrum.   The goal of this project was to expand our understanding of the optical physics governing unconventional polarization states of light and how this new type of illumination interacts with particles and nano structures.  The impact of these results are expected to extend to new measurement methods in both the applied and fundamental optical sciences,   new ways of applying light scattering spectroscopy to problems in biomedicine and earth/environmental sciences,  and new analytical tools for the modeling of generalized optical systems.   \n\nThe transformation of an ordinary beam into an unconventional polarization state leads to new methods of measuring polarization.  \n\nAn optical element as simple as a stressed window can function as an elegant transformation element that leads to a new way of mapping the polarization of light to an areal irradiance distribution.  This has the potential to change the way we think about measuring photons.  \n\nA new holographic angular-domain elastic scattering (HADES) method can yield angularly-resolved light scattering of small particles.  For a first demonstration, the system was tested using linearly-polarized incident light; the eventual goal is to use inhomogeneously-polarized incident light.  It is possible to make robust size estimates of organelle-sized beads in cell-sized regions using HADES. Angularly-resolved scattered intensity data from cell-sized target regions contains large-grained speckle that resembles Mie-scattering features.  As a result, the speckle complicates attempts to estimate the size of the scatterers.  Using the HADES technique, we jointly estimated scatterer locations and scatterer sizes for static distributions of micron-sized beads.  This mimicked measurements that could eventually be performed upon single biological cells.\n\nIt is possible to measure the four dimensional state of spatial coherence of an optical beam by a series of measurements of the shadow of a small obstacle. By scanning this obstacle across the transverse profile of the beam, the correlation between the field at any pair of points can be characterized. This technique does not involve a complicated interferometric setup and can be implemented with an apparatus as simple as a liquid crystal classroom projector combined with ordinary polarizers and lenses.     \n\nA thorough ray-based and wave-based analysis has shown how optical beams can preserve their intensity profile under propagation while their intensity maxima trace a curved path that traces nearly a full circle.

We were able to fabricate and test two different types of guided mode resonances, measuring the phase response for the first time.  \n\nUnconventional polarization states can provide new experimental methods for polarimetric scatterometry of small particles and nano structures. The polarization of scattered light often shows the signature of a particle\u00c6s shape and orientation. By illuminating an ensemble of spherical scatterers with an unconvention..."
