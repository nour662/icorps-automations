The research will leverage existing patent-pending energy-efficient\r\nalgorithms for determining motor condition based on vibration and temperature data to develop\r\nwireless nodes capable of autonomously determining the condition of any motor to which they\r\nare attached. The research will result in a prototype system of wireless nodes implemented\r\nat an industrial partner, which will provide the necessary incentive for future investment\r\nin the company and technology.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research will be to enable a wireless system to facilitate\r\ncondition-based maintenance of electric motors in industrial facilities at a cost of less\r\nthan $300 per motor to manufacturers, which is about 10% of the cost of current systems.\r\nAt this price point, tens of thousands of facilities around the United States will be able\r\nto afford the initial investment to implement condition-based maintenance on their motor systems.\r\nSince condition-based maintenance has been shown to maximize up-time and minimize yearly maintenance\r\ncosts, this will increase the competitiveness of American manufacturing and ultimately\r\nhelp create more manufacturing sector jobs.

More specifically, the end-goal of the research started under this project is to facilitate condition-based maintenance of electric motors in industrial facilities at a cost of less than $300 per motor to manufacturers, which is about 10% of the cost of current systems. At this price point, tens of thousands of facilities around the United States will be able to afford the initial investment to implement condition-based maintenance on their motor systems.\n\nThree significant project outcomes characterize the research performed under this project.  1) A prototype wireless sensor node (pictured in Figures One - Six) was designed and manufactured.  The node consists of a 32-bit low-power microprocessor, a Wireless HART radio, sensor attachments which include accelerometers and temperature sensors, and peripheral housings and electronics.  The sensor attachments magnetically couple to the motor housing near the motor bearings and feed information to the microprocessor, which runs patent-pending algorithms to determine the motor condition based on sensor data.  The wireless radio then transmits this data through a network manager (Figure Six) back to the computer of a plant manager, where he/she can access the condition of the plant's motors. 2) The operation of the wireless node was validated in both laboratory and real-world conditions.  A range of &gt;200m was achieved even in industrial environments with significant electromagnetic interference and multi-path fading. 3) Prototype multi-node wireless networks for motor monitoring were demonstrated at two separate industrial partners, covering 12 motors in total.  The network implements self-organizing wireless mesh technology, allowing the network to cope with the challenging conditions at the industrial partner facilities, which included a power plant and an aerospace manufacturing company.
