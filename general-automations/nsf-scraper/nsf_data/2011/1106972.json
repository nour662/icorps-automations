 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transmission eigenvalue problem is a non-selfadjoint eigenvalue problem that originally arose in inverse scattering theory but has also recently appeared in thermo-acoustic imaging. The importance of transmission eigenvalues in inverse scattering theory is that these eigenvalues can be determined from the measured scattering data and they carry information  about the material properties of the scatterer. This proposal is concerned with a mathematical investigation of transmission eigenvalues in electromagnetic scattering theory and the application of these results to problems in nondestructive testing.  Until now research on transmission eigenvalues and their applications has concentrated on the case when the scatterer is a dielectric. Even in this restricted case, only partial results are available when the the scatterer has cavities, cracks  or inclusions (such situations are of course important in nondestructive testing). The investigators plan to  extend  these existing  results for dielectrics  to the case when the scatterer may have cavities, cracks or inclusions as well as being absorbing or dispersive. This leads, among other problems, to a study of complex transmission eigenvalues and an investigation of whether or not real eigenvalues exist in this case.   \r\n \r\n The nondestructive testing of materials in the areas of defense and manufacturing has become an increasingly important area from the points of view of both reliability and cost saving. Unfortunately, in many areas of national importance simple and effective methods for testing material for structural imperfections is still in its infancy.  In this proposal the investigators will mathematically  examine the possibility of using a newly discovered data set that can be obtained from the interrogation of materials by electromagnetic waves. This data set consists of what are called \"transmission eigenvalues\"  and such eigenvalues carry information about the structural stability of the material being tested.  In order to utilize these eigenvalues for the nondestructive testing of realistic materials it is necessary to examine the case when the material being tested is partially conducting, i.e. can absorb energy from the interrogating electromagnetic wave as well as the case when the material properties are frequency dependent, i.e. the material is \"dispersive\".  This project is devoted to the problem of understanding 1) what information  transmission eigenvalues provide about absorbing and dispersive  material which may have imperfections and 2) how these transmission eigenvalues can be effectively determined from the measured scattering data.",
