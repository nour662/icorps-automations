 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanical behavior of large faults is controlled by thermal, chemical, and hydraulic factors,\r\nas well as each fault's intrinsic structure and the ambient stresses. Understanding what conditions\r\nprevail within the interiors of active faults is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms governing\r\nlong-term fault evolution and, in particular, the earthquake rupture process. This project involves\r\na detailed study of microearthquakes and crustal structure within and surrounding the Alpine\r\nFault, South Island, New Zealand, around the Whataroa fault zone drilling site. It will be carried\r\nout close collaboration with a team of New Zealand scientists. The key scientific issues to be\r\naddressed by this research project include: (1) determining the geometry of the AF to mid-crustal\r\ndepths and the depth to the base of the seismogenic zone, (2) determining focal mechanisms and\r\nestimating principal stress orientations, (3) seismic imaging of crustal structure using multiple\r\nmethods, and (4) searching for possible nonvolcanic tremor (NVT). Our project is designed to\r\ntest a number of hypotheses, including: (1) that the complexity of the surface fault trace does not\r\nreflect the fault trace at depth, rather the partitioning seen at the surface merges into a throughgoing\r\nfault with oblique slip in the upper crust; (2) that the depth to the base of the seismogenic\r\nzone is elevated to 15 km, or perhaps shallower, on the AF beneath the Whataroa area; (3) that\r\nthe AF dip remains close to 50\u00b0 to the base of the seismogenic zone; (4) that principal stress\r\norientations do not vary with distance from the AF; (5) that the relatively low velocity zone\r\nimaged at large scale through much of the crust along the SIGHT transects is actually a narrower\r\nzone closer to the AF, similar to the resistivity model; (6) that NVT is not present beneath the\r\nAF.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to examine the structure and microearthquake characteristics of a\r\nmajor active continental fault, the Alpine Fault, South Island, New Zealand. The Alpine Fault is\r\nlate in its earthquake cycle and is the focus of a long-term, multidisciplinary scientific\r\ninvestigation. In this project, we will carry out seismic field work and subsequent analyses of\r\nmicroearthquakes associated with the Alpine Fault. The research will be conducted in\r\nconjunction with an ambitious fault zone drilling project focused on the mechanical properties of\r\nthe Alpine Fault and the adjacent crust. Their work will help (1) define the geometry of the fault\r\nat depth, (2) determine the depth range of seismic activity (the \"seismogenic zone\"), (3) establish\r\na three-dimensional structural context for interpreting borehole observations and core, and (4)\r\npotentially help to define rupture zones of shallow earthquakes as future drilling targets.",
