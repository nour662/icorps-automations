 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests partial support for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend an international meeting on neuroethology as part of the Gordon Research Conference series. The meeting will be held at Stonehill College, Massachusetts, USA, August 14-19, 2011, and will be preceded by a Gordon Research Seminar (August 13-14) developed specifically for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The long-term goal of this ongoing conference is to increase our understanding of the development, function, and evolution of neural circuits. The 2011 meeting features several sessions that investigate how animals live in their species-specific sensory worlds. The key question: Can we use our understanding of sensory systems to link neuroscience and ecology?  The specific aim of this meeting is to convene leaders representing the forefront of neuroethology research for a 5 day conference in an academic setting selected to foster interaction. The organizers of the Gordon Research Seminar and the Gordon Research Conference will target financial support to minorities underrepresented in science, and will give priority to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows attending their first Gordon Research Conference. The broader impact of the Gordon Research Seminar will be the creation of an opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to discuss the present and the future of neuroethology in an open, informal atmosphere that will prepare young scientists to derive maximum benefit from the full Gordon Research Conference that follows.",
