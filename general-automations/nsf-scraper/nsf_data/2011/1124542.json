RDCs offer researchers secure access to data collected by the Census Bureau and other participating government agencies.  The centers  meet all physical and computer security requirements for access to confidential data and they allow researchers to use Census Bureau data files to study relationships between social, economic, environmental, and health process and outcomes in a unique way.\r\n\r\nThis center is the first center in the Pacific Northwest and joins a network of 12 other RDCs located in Washington DC,  Boston, Ann Arbor, Berkeley, Los Angeles, North Carolina, Chicago, New York, Texas, and Atlanta.  This RDC will be used by researchers from a variety of institutions; besides the University of Washington, other users will come from Washington State University, the University of Oregon, Oregon State University, and Portland State University.  All research projects conducted at the center will go through a review process to protect data confidentiality.  Researchers using the center include economists, sociologists, statisticians, health scientists, and civil engineers.\r\n\r\nThe center will provide new facilities for graduate student training and will lead to new collaborations between university researchers, private foundations in the Seattle area, and local governments.",

A Federal Statistical Research Data Center (RDC) is a Census Bureau facility staffed by a Census Bureau employee that meets all physical and computer security requirements for access to confidential data.   These facilities used to be called Census Research Data Centers but have been renamed Federal Statistical Research Data Centers to reflect their provision of restricted data from multiple federal agencies.  \nAt RDCs, researchers from academia, federal agencies, and other institutions with approved projects receive restricted access to Census Bureau data files - including decennial census, economic, health, and environmental data - that are not publicly available. Many of these datasets provide unique opportunities to study relationships between a variety of social, economic, environmental and health processes/outcomes. Such data are vital if one wants to investigate relationships at microspatial scales with individual, establishment or institutional data.   \nThe NWRDC yielded INTELLECTUAL MERIT by providing local access to restricted-use data sets for faculty at UW and other regional higher education institutions in the Northwest working in social, economic, health, environment, public policy and other fields. These data enhance the capacity of researchers in all of these areas to conduct scientifically meritorious research and to produce findings of benefit to the Census Bureau and other government agencies that provide access to restricted data through RDCs.   \nThe NWRDC created BROADER IMPACT by providing opportunities for graduate and postdoctoral research training on projects requiring confidential data. As such, the NWRDC has enhanced skills for young social scientists and thereby increased their ability to pursue successful research careers.   The NWRDC has also attracted young researchers to UW, increasing the local pool of talent working in the social sciences, public policy and health fields. \nThe NWRDC is a physical facility - a computer lab with secured entry and monitoring equipment - near UW\u00c6s campus that was remodeled with UW funds and supplied with equipment funded by UW, NSF, and the US Census Bureau.
