This award also supports the acquisition of a Gas Bench II device to analyze carbonate, water, and gas samples.\r\n\r\nThe analytical instruments will be used for a broad range of scientific research involving climate, coupled natural and human systems, and water resources.  Near-term research projects include climatology from cave and lake deposits, studies of hurricanes, sea-level transgressions, and isotope hydrology.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts involve establishing a state-of-the-art analytical facility at a primarily undergraduate teaching institution where students may experience scientific research up close.  The acquisition also helps underwrite the research of two female early career scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch on past climate change impacts including hurricane-climate interactions is hampered by a lack of stable isotope machine time, particularly for very small carbonate mineral samples from cave stalagmites.  This MRI project provided funding to acquire a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) with sample input devices that we use to measure the stable isotopes of C, O, N and H in a wide range of different samples including carbonates, organic materials, and water.  This technology greatly enhanced science infrastructure of an undergraduate liberal arts teaching institution (Skidmore College) during the grant period, and supported two female tenure-track faculty members in Geosciences and Anthropology who were both awarded tenure in 2015\n\nThis grant focused on instrument acquisition for teaching and research.  The first two years were spent on configuring the space, obtaining and setting up the instrumentation, obtaining supporting materials, tools, and supplies, calibrating and testing the instruments to ensure that they met the factory specifications, and validating our analytical procedures and methods.  We hosted a week-long advanced training course in instrument maintenance, software, troubleshooting, and optimization which we opened to faculty from nearby Union College who recently set up a similar NSF-supported facility.  We began regular operations, developed standard operating procedures for each sample type, maintained the equipment, scheduled projects, and implemented our data management plan. \n\nOnce the instrumentation became available for users, we began analyzing many samples for Skidmore College research and teaching applications.  Undergraduates were actively engaged in cutting-edge collaborative research in the lab, involving nine faculty members from five different academic units, including ten students employed as lab research assistants on funded projects.  We developed new modules that use the instrument in various courses, a sample extraction line for teaching, an engaging 20-minute demonstration for lab visitors, and a website.  Over 100 students in eight classes received broad research training conducted through classroom instruction in Geosciences and Anthropology. \n\nDuring the project period, our essential instrument acquisition goals were met and some of the outcomes exceeded our expectations.  For example, we attracted several new Skidmore faculty users within the first year of general use, as well as users from Bowdoin College and Durham University, UK.  New on-campus users were expected for the 2015-16 academic year.   In addition, our quality control and quality assurance tests give us confidence that we are providing users with reliable data.  A few projects are highlighted below.\n\nStudent projects:  We analyzed hair samples for dietary studies in Anthropology courses.  Students analyzed eggs, beverages, fossil teeth, and shells for a class project in a new advanced Geosciences course on isotopes.  We performed replicate analysis of local mineral springs, surface water, precipitation, and bottled water.  Undergraduate thesis and summer research projects analyzed plankton fecal pellets and stalagmites.\n\nFaculty Projects :  We analyzed extinct common Paleozoic microfossils from planktonic organisms known as dacryoconarids, broadly analogous to Cenozoic foraminifera.  Our results revealed the fossils\u00c6 broad utility for resolving key patterns of ancient global environmental change events (Frappier et al. 2015).  This novel application opens new research avenues in Devonian limestones and even black shales including the Marcellus Formation.  A community ecology class analyzed worm castings and soil from a woodland-lawn interface.  We analyzed calcite from a Bermuda stalagmite to study past hurricane-climate interactions (in progress). \n\nOutreach:  We held numerous open-houses, visitor workshops, and tours ranging from pre-school students to our institution's Trustees.  We hosted a week-lo..."
