This award will support 24 participants at different stages of their careers. \r\n\r\nThe conference will focus on the recent advances made by Dr. Winter and his colleagues in nuclear C*-algebras and their connections with topological dynamical systems.  Lectures will be designed to be accessible to graduate students and mathematicians with only basic knowledge of C*-algebras, and new open problems which present good research opportunities for graduate students will be discussed.",
