 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop fundamental radio-frequency building blocks enabling the development of software-defined radio technology to demonstrate ubiquitous reconfigurability for increased connectivity and natural resource preservation.  The approach is based on the cooperative operation of the radio-frequency circuitry with the baseband signal processing unit to achieve high average power efficiency and linearity. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  A new power amplifier operating principle in which tunable matching networks work cooperatively with an envelope predistorter will be developed to optimize overall average power efficiency while delivering linear RF transmitted power. A new filter-less up-converter implemented using a polyphase mixer integrated with a new digitally controlled rotary traveling wave oscillator will be developed for spurious control and frequency agility. Demonstration testbeds will be realized to validate the cooperative operation concepts.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Power-efficient and standard-compliant wireless technology will have profound societal and economic impact by saving energy and preserving natural resources through hardware reuse. The scientific results will be disseminated in the classroom and educational laboratories, through the Connection One NSF Industry/University Collaborative Research Center, and in scientific journals.  The research will provide significant support to the wireless industry by training personnel for wireless technology. Half of the research activity will be conducted at North Carolina A&T State University, an institution with a large undergraduate and graduate minority population.  Underrepresented minority undergraduate students in engineering will be recruited through summer internships and outreach activities to work on this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n The Ohio State University led a collaborative research project with NCAT for the development of a filter-less software defined radio (SDR) transmitter which would be frequency agile.  Software defined radios are new types of cellular phones which can be reprogramed to support new communication standards and services as they are developed.   These radios are intended to operate in a wide frequency band of operation, typically from 50 MHz to 6000 MHz.  Current phones operate in the following frequency bands: 824-896, 890-960, 1710-1755 and 2110-2155 MHz.  Given the large radio frequency (RF) bandwidth targeted for SDR, it is not convenient to rely on bulky filters to remove spurious frequencies and harmonics, since these devices are typically not tunable and requires banks of switches and filters.  \n\n In this project, we demonstrated a filter-less in-band linearization and harmonic cancellation scheme for SDR transmitters for the second and third harmonics.  Harmonics are undesired signals which are octaves apart from the fundamental radio frequency to be broadcasted.  Large harmonics are typically generated by RF amplifiers operating under a highly efficient power regime.  Linearization is a process by which the distortions at the RF amplifiers are effectively removed, thus avoiding polluting adjacent and upper bands. In this work, both the linearization and harmonic cancellation were performed by programmable active filters instead of conventional fixed passive filters. \n\n In support of this research, we have also reported a new technique for the characterization of the RF power transistors.  Transistors are the electronic components which serve as the workhorse of electronics in general, and RF amplifiers in particular.  We have developed a new method which enables us to characterize them in a single modulated RF measurement.  This method has the potential to save a great amount of time for engineers developing models for new semiconductor technologies.   \n\n Finally one of the most profound outcomes of this project was the development of the first nonlinear embedding device model available in a circuit simulator that enables the circuit designer to synthesize RF amplifiers.   Typically, a transistor is modeled by an inner core surrounded by nonlinear and linear device parasitics which store or dissipate energy.  The core which provides the current voltage characteristics of the transistor is frequency independent.   The device and package parasitics introduce the frequency dependence which alters the device performance at high frequencies.  Ideal modes of operation for amplifiers are well defined for the inner core, and exhibit well-known power efficiency, linearity and output power characteristics.  These are referred as PA classes.  \n\n Designers of RF amplifiers are interested in knowing in which class the PA is operating at the inner core in order to optimize the device performance.   When PA designers want to target a specific class of operation at the inner core, trial and error is used in simulation or measurement to tune the input and output circuits of the transistors using a technique referred to as load-pulling and source-pulling.  Even with automated tuners or modern circuit simulators, load and source pull measurements/simulations are very time consuming processes, particularly since they must typically be conducted simultaneously for the fundamental, second harmonic and third harmonics at both the input and output of the transistors.   Theoretically, billions of measurements or simulations need to be performed if a systematic mapping is to be pursued with a reasonable degree of accuracy.   \n\n With our new approach using our new nonlinear-embedding device model, a single computer simulation is sufficient to obtain an exact solution for the characteristics of the passive microwave circuits which need to be developed at the input and output of the RF transistor at the fundamental and harmonic frequencies.  Using the new embedding device model, we have demonstrated the first-pass design of a high-efficiency two-transistor asymmetric Doherty PA.   This PA achieved 70% efficiency at both peak and backoff powers while using a 9 dB backoff.   Note that modern communication signals operate with an average power around 10 dB below the peak power.  Thus the efficiency at backoff is of great importance.   After DPD linearization, the Doherty PA designed achieved above 50% efficiency for LTE signals while meeting the linearization with a distortion (ACPR) above 50 dB as required by cellular standards.  \n\n We also experimentally demonstrated for a Class B power amplifier how the embedding device model predicted the amplitude and phase of the second harmonics required to be injected at the input.  Up to 10% efficiency improvement was obtained between the ideal and non-ideal injection, in agreement with the embedding device model prediction.  \n\n It is believed that the embedding device model will introduce a new paradigm shift in PA design which should greatly facilitate the synthesis of new types of broad-band and power-efficient RF power amplifiers for future communication systems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick Roblin"
