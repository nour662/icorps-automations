Intellectually, the proposed project will involve careful work with existing data that conforms to the highest standards of social science research with the proposed white papers subjected to scrutiny by a panel of experts (publications review board). \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe relatively small numbers of women of color combined with their dispersion across fields and institutions have posed challenges to ADVANCE efforts to date. By engaging in careful research on information from STEM disciplinary societies and large, nationally-representative datasets, the project will go far in describing the academic lives of women of color in comparison to men of color, non-minority women, and non-minority men. These datasets are available at multiple times therefore the project will document trends for these groups to determine the extent and direction of change over the past thirty years.  Extensive dissemination is planned via multiple contexts which will ensure that the information is distributed to key audiences. Meetings, workshops, national conferences, and a targeted conference in the project's final year along with the well-established CPST and AIP websites and the ADVANCE portal will be used to access varied audiences with the results of the work.",
