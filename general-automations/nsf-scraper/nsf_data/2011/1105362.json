This research project will bring together expertise in state-of-the-art semiconductor nanowire growth, in modeling of these structures, and in unique excitation spectroscopies in order to advance the understanding of dynamical properties of semiconductor nanowires whose diameters are in the quantum regime.  This project will: support the design and growth of unique radial and axial nanowire heterostructures; develop new optical tools for measurement of quantum states and their interactions; investigate nanowire heterostructures in the quantum regime utilizing these new tools; employ highly localized electric fields to manipulate and probe the electronic states in the nanowire  heterostructures; carry out both optical and transport measurements; and explore spin dynamics in these nanowire heterostructures.  By designing, growing, and probing nanowire radial and axial heterostructures with length scales from 5 nm - 50 nm, we will have access to the truly quantum regime in these materials.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in these state-of-the-art techniques, which are an excellent preparation for careers ranging from research and education in academia, to applied development research in the most technologically advanced industries.  The overall goal of this research is to advance the understanding of dynamical processes in semiconductor nanowires in the quantum regime.\r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\n\r\nSemiconductor nanowires have recently emerged as a new class of materials with significant potential for the advancement of understanding of fundamental physics and for new applications in device physics. The research in this project will bring together expertise in state-of-the-art semiconductor nanowire growth, in modeling of these structures, and in experimental efforts that will advance the understanding of semiconductor nanowires whose diameters are less than 50 nm (1/1000 of the diameter of a human hair), a range where the materials themselves are comparable to the size of the wavelength of electrons. Remarkable phenomena and new technological opportunities are expected when synthetic materials can be designed so as to control the electron wavefunctions.  These states can be probed using both optical and transport measurements by using highly localized electric fields, magnetic fields, and utilizing unique nanowire heterostructures.  This research will be particularly directed towards the effect of spins in these materials where both new physics and new technologies may be enabled.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in state-of-the-art optical and electronic techniques for looking at single nanowires.  Such training is excellent preparation for careers from research and teaching in academia to applied development in the most technologically advanced industries.
