 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project, in collaboration with General Motors (GM) R&D Center, will develop a novel system of experimentally validated, physics-based multi-level computational models for simulating multi-scale deformation and predicting ductile failure in Magnesium alloys. Simulations will focus on high strain rate impact loading and forming processes. The multi-scale model will develop modules at three relevant scales, viz. (i) macroscopic scale of structural components, (ii) microscopic scale of individual grains and polycrystalline aggregates, and (iii) atomic scales of crystal lattices for postulating crack evolution. Both homogenization and localization strategies will be incorporated in a hierarchical-concurrent framework. Specific developmental modules include: (i) image-based three-dimensional microstructure generation of polycrystalline aggregates, (ii) image-based crystal-plasticity FEM modeling of microstructural deformation and failure, (iii) homogenized continuum plasticity-damage laws for incorporation in macroscopic models, and (iv) macroscopic simulations. GM will be responsible for experiments at different scales to validate and calibrate the computational models. The program will provide an unprecedented understanding of the role of microstructure on deformation and failure characteristics in Magnesium alloys. \r\n\r\nMagnesium alloys have a huge potential for enhancing fuel efficiency and energy economization in the automotive industry, which will be facilitated. The program will aid the materials industry, where materials development is stymied by not knowing how variabilities at different scales affect performance and processing. Graduate students will have a strong interaction with eminent industrial researchers. The program will educate next generation of engineers on the challenges of emerging technologies, with a unique academia-industry perspective.",
