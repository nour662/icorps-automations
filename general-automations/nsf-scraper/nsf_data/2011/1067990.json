 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physics of cold atoms is only partially known and our information is generally limited to only a few kinds of atoms. In this project we are working to uncover the collisional properties of atoms that are new to the cold and ultracold regime, and extend methods for their creation and manipulation. The atoms being studied are drawn from the pnictogens and halogens (for example, Nitrogen and Chlorine), so far nearly untouched in the realm of cold atoms. By trapping and cooling these atoms, we will learn whether they can be made into quantum gases and how they interact as they collide with each other in a cold, dilute gas. Such behavior is among the most fundamental collision phenomena in Nature. We are also working toward the practical realization of a hybrid cold atoms source using laser cooling along with buffer-gas cooling, with the aim of creating higher flux cold atom beam technology.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the importance of this work is to uncover new science and open up new vistas in the use of cold atoms. Due to the fundamental nature of these collision studies, it may be the largest impact will involve new ideas and technologies that are as yet unknown. Potential applications include higher precision spectroscopy of key atoms found in space and the atmosphere and increased numbers of trapped atoms for a variety or work, including improving the qualities of technological materials.",
