 "awd_abstract_narration": "INTELLECTUAL MERIT.  Cell polarity is a fundamental biological process by which asymmetry of cell components is generated in response to endogenous programming or external cues.  It is crucial for cell morphogenesis, proliferation, and differentiation in all organisms.  One key concept to emerge from studies in diverse organisms is that proteins that localize to the cell cortex provide spatial cues that determine the site of growth and the plane of cell division.  The fungus Ustilago maydis is ideally suited for the studies proposed here because of its ability to switch from a yeast-like to a filamentous morphology, the highly polarized growth exhibited by one of these forms, its genetic tractability, the availability of molecular and cell biological tools for its manipulation, and availability of its genome sequence.  The tea4 gene was identified by the Principal Investigator in a genetic screen to isolate mutants with altered cell morphology.  It codes for a protein with similarity to fission yeast Tea4, which has been shown to be necessary for the axis of polarized growth.  Tea4 contains domains indicative of a role in protein-protein interactions.  Ustilago Tea4 contains additional domains not present in the yeast protein, which suggests that Tea4 may have additional functions in this fungus.  Deletion of the tea4 gene in Ustilago results in an altered axis of polarized growth, misplaced plane of cell division, aberrant cell wall deposition, altered cell width, and reduced rate of growth.  The focus of this project is to understand how Tea4 controls cell polarity and other processes that contribute to cell shape.  What we learn about cell polarity in Ustilago will be generally relevant to other cells, particularly, those that undergo changes in cell morphology and those that exhibit extreme polarization such as pollen tubes, root hairs, axonal neurons, and fungal hyphae.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS.  This project aims to integrate research with education at California State University-Long Beach, a comprehensive Hispanic serving institution.   This university provides an excellent opportunity to recruit students from underrepresented groups and the project is ideally suited to engage undergraduate and graduate students in research.  The project will make it possible for the students to learn how to pose hypotheses, design experiments to test them, critically evaluate and interpret experimental results, and learn to troubleshoot and propose alternative approaches.  In addition, It will offer them the opportunity to learn basic microbiological, molecular and cell biological techniques, microscopy and image-capture analysis.  The results of this research will be disseminated at scientific meetings by the PI and students, and in peer-reviewed publications.  This project will also allow the PI to maintain an active research program and to incorporate findings of the research project in inquiry-based learning in lecture and laboratory courses taught by the PI.  Data from this research will be provided to the students in the classroom for analysis, interpretation and group discussion so that they become active participants in discovery-based knowledge.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA fundamental problem in biology is to understand how cells establish an axis of polarized growth, which is crucial for cell morphogenesis.  It is thought that certain proteins located at the cell cortex mark the site where growth will occur and transmit their location to the cytoskeleton, which in turn mobilizes cellular components to these sites.   We chose to study this problem in the fungus Ustilago maydis because it exhibits two shapes in its life cycle, a yeast form and a filamentous (thread-like) form.  Furthermore, the yeast form is nonpathogenic whereas the filamentous form is pathogenic.  This offers the opportunity not only to understand the mechanisms that determine cell shape but also how cell shape and pathogenicity are intertwined. \n\nOur specific goal was to understand the role of the Tea4 protein in determining the axis of growth.  In previous work, we identified Tea4 and showed that if the gene is deleted the cells exhibit altered axis of growth and site of cell division and altered cell wall deposition resulting in aberrantly-shaped cells. The cell wall is important in cell shape in all fungi.  As part of this project, and to better understand the function of Tea4, we determined the localization of Tea4 by fusing it to the green fluorescent protein (GFP), which allows the researcher to examine live cells using fluorescence microscopy and observe where proteins localize during cell growth. We observed that Tea4 localizes to sites of polarized growth and the site of cell division.   This observation combined with the mutant phenotype described above led us to conclude that Tea4 is necessary for establishing the axis of cell polarity and the site of cell division.  The Tea4 protein has different domains (specialized protein regions that contribute to different aspects of protein function), which suggest that it may serve as a scaffold for different proteins.   One of these domains appears to be important for the function and localization of Tea4 because its removal alters localization and leads to an aberrant cell shape.  We also asked what happens when the cell produces too much Tea4 protein.  This work is in progress.  The idea is that if too much Tea4 alters the axis of polarized growth, it is likely due to titration of other proteins, preventing them from carrying out their cellular function. \n\nAs part of this project, we identified the Tea1 protein.  We showed that it localizes to sites of polarized growth and the site of cell division as Tea4 does.   Deletion of Tea1 leads to phenotypes similar to those conferred by deletion of Tea4.  Thus, Tea1 is also necessary for the axis of cell polarity and the site of cell division.  We began experiments to determine how Tea4 and Tea1 affect localization of other important polarity factors and how other polarity factors affect localization of Tea4 and Tea1.  This work is in progress.  We also began experiments to identify proteins that might interact with Tea4 and Tea1.  This is important in identifying the cellular machinery required for the axis of polarized growth and the site of cell division, and ultimately cell morphogenesis.\n\nThese findings contribute to a better understanding of the cellular function of the Tea4 and Tea1 proteins in determining the axis of cell polarity and other processes that are important in generation of cell shape.  These findings in Ustilago will be generally relevant to other cells, particularly those that undergo changes in cell shape, such as animal and plant cells during development, and to cells that exhibit extreme polarized growth such as fungal hyphae (filaments), root hairs, pollen tubes and axonal neurons. \n\nThis project has had a major impact in the training of undergraduate and master student researchers.  Most of the students who participated in the project are from groups underrepresented in science.  The project provided the opportunity to develop their critical thinking skills and to acquire expertise in a broad range of microbiological, molecular genetics, cell biological, and bioinformatics skills that they can apply in their future science careers.  In addition participation in the project motivated many of the students to pursue or consider pursuing careers in science or in teaching science.  This project has also helped to increase the scientific literacy of the population and to increase the diversity of future researchers.\n\nThe findings of this project have been disseminated at national and international scientific conferences or as scientific articles.  Students who were major participants in the project have been included as coauthors.\n\nThe project has allowed the PI to maintain an active research group, keep up-to-date in developments in the field, contribute to scientific knowledge and incorporate findings of this project in inquiry-based learning in lecture and laboratory courses taught by the PI. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/11/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Flora Banuett"
