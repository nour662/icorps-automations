 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: This project is on the growth and properties of monolayer graphene and graphene based heterostructures formed by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The well-controlled carbon deposition rates made possible by MBE enable the growth of films under a wide range of kinetic conditions while removing effects related to carbon precursor chemistry, which exist naturally in the commonly used chemical vapor deposition processes. The research is inspired by recent studies of graphene grown on copper foils, which show graphene island nucleation as the ultimate bottleneck to achieving pristine graphene in this system. The project, building on these results, investigates the conditions that lead to controlled graphene nucleation and probes the critical interactions between graphene edge atoms and substrate adatoms, which play a key role in island evolution. Experiments of graphene growth on different substrates by low-energy electron microscopy is expected to provide fundamental insight into the roles of substrate texture, lattice mismatch, substrate stepflow, and interfacial interactions. In addition, MBE will be used to form graphene-dielectric bilayers under ultrahigh vacuum conditions, which will be studied further via electrical, structural and optical measurements.\r\nNontechnical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The application of molecular beam epitaxy to graphene growth brings the extensive capabilities of this advanced deposition technique into the fold of graphene science and technology. If the project is successful, new functionalities and enhanced properties can emerge through the formation of pristine interfaces between graphene and other materials. An education plan is integrated with the research and brings together emerging scholars from across different levels of higher education, community college to graduate school, for the study of graphene. Outreach project activities center on the integration of original research concepts into summer experiences for undergraduates and community college students from traditionally underrepresented groups in science and engineering. Summer investigations on graphene will serve as test beds for lab instructional modules that will be implemented in a senior-level, capstone laboratory course.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGraphene, a one-atom-thick layer of covalently bonded carbon atoms, has captured the imagination of scientists and the public alike for its wonderous qualities including its electrical, optical, and mechanical properties.  The first crystals of graphene were isolated by using adhesive tape to exfoliate graphite.  As a result, small crystals with dimensions in the micrometer range were obtained.  Unfortunately, for graphene to become a technological material, crystals of much larger size&mdash;as large as silicon wafers&mdash;must be grown.  One way to overcome this limit is by growing a layer of graphene over a large surface. To date large, one-atom-thick films have been grown on multiple metal surfaces as well as the semiconductor germanium.  These films are typically composed of multiple crystals that are misoriented with respect to each other&mdash;that is, the films are polycrystalline.  Understanding how crystals can become aligned on a surface would enable scientists and technologists to produce single-crystalline rather than polycrystalline films.\n\n            The research funded by this award probed how graphene islands grow on metal surfaces. By elucidating growth mechanisms of graphene islands, a novel paradigm for high-quality synthesis was uncovered.  Our research focused on growing graphene crystals on gold, iridium, and germanium.  In each of these cases, we learned that the preferred orientation of islands with respect to these three substrates is governed by the degree to which the island can become corrugated, or rippled:  the greater the corrugation, the more stable the island.  Thus, by designing or identifying materials whose surfaces support island corrugation, the islands can become aligned with respect to each other and, upon further growth, coalesce into a film with a unique crystallographic orientation.  This result can be applied to other materials that are layered in nature and are receiving significant attention as semiconductors for next-generation devices but are still polycrystalline.\n\nBecause of its \"star\" quality in the materials world, graphene is an excellent material to engage students.  The education and outreach program made possible by this award brought together students across many levels of higher education, from community college to graduate school.  Project activities included integrating graphene growth into the summer experiences of undergraduate students. In addition, a lab activity on the growth and characterization of graphene was introduced in a senior-level course. Finally, graduate students gained valuable experience in nanoscale science and engineering as well as in mentorship, teaching, and the design of course materials.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Oscar D Dubon"
