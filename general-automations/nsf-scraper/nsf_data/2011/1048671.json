 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Carlito Lebrilla and colleague R. David Britt from University of California at Davis will acquire an X-band EPR spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) water splitting cobalt catalysts, (b) multielectron reduction of carbon dioxide, (c) studies of metalloproteins, (d) functionalized materials and catalysts in surfaces and zeolites, (e) silicon-doped nanoparticles, (f) polaron delocalization in conjugated polymer blends, and (g) transition metal complexes with uncommon coordination numbers and oxidation states.\r\n\r\nAn EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds of biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument will be an integral part of research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels.",
