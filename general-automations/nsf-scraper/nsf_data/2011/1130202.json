 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integrated research, mentoring and culture experiences will be offered to eight undergraduates per year in Shanghai, China. Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) senior students will be engaged in research on water treatment in an economically growing region - Shanghai, China. The students will spend a total of eight weeks at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) and complete their degree-required research projects under the supervision of both WPI faculty and faculty at the School of Environmental Science and Engineering at SJTU. WPI is developing a research center in Shanghai that enables these opportunities for students.  This grant will further strengthen the development of this center. The center will leverage WPI's infrastructure for these international research projects. \r\n\r\nThere is an increasing trend for US companies to develop manufacturing and research relationships with corresponding industries in China. From the perspective of environmental engineering, the recognized environmental challenges in China provide opportunities for non-Chinese entities to develop businesses in addressing the solutions or prevention of environmental problems. Therefore, a program that provides opportunities for US undergraduate students to participate in research in China under the mentorship of Chinese researchers and to learn about the Chinese perspectives in understanding the nature of technical issues, the challenges faced, and the Chinese approach to decision making and problem resolution could be very valuable for the participating students.  Both WPI and SJTU faculty members involved are committed to mentoring undergraduates in research and professional development.  Experiences by undergraduates working in a research setting in China will be valuable in broadening their understanding and forming a more effective foundation for future technical collaborations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe rapid pace of technological change, the rise of a global economy and the historically unprecedented characteristics of the Information Age are transforming the nature of engineering education imposing new educational imperatives. It is now widely recognized that young engineers should be adequately prepared to assume leadership roles in both the private and public sectors and conduct their professional lives across disciplines, as well as national and cultural boundaries.\n\nThis IRES provides opportunities for WPI senior UG students to spend  8  academic  weeks  at  SJTU.  Research  projects  in  diverse  areas  of  water treatment offered include: the effects of hydrophobic and hydrophilic natural organic matter on charged ultrafiltration performance; reactor engineering problems in up-flow anaerobic sludge digesters; removal of heavy metal from aqueous solutions by a complexation-ultrafiltration process; sulfur-utilizing autotrophic denitrification process for the treatment of nitrate-rich water; the immobilization of active sludge with UV and its application in micro-polluted wastewater; pollutant evolvement recorded in the sediment from the Dianshan Lake, Shanghai. \n\nThis project provides  1)  international research opportunities for WPI UG students in water treatment at Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU) in Shanghai, China; 2) personal and profession development training to enhance students? professional network and help to increase retention in the engineering profession, and increase the likelihood of their pursuing advanced degrees.\n\nThis project also provides an unique engineering curriculum that (i) emphasizes interdisciplinary learning through teamwork, (ii) provides engagement in real-life professionally designed projects, and (iii) introduces an international dimension into the educational experiences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: H.
