 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to transform neuroscience teaching and learning, the Molecular Genetics in Neurophysiology Laboratories Type I TUES project develops, implements, and evaluates six comprehensive, inquiry-based teaching modules in which students perform electrophysiology and locomotor behavior assays on wild type and mutant Drosophila melanogaster.  The intent is to create and evaluate new teaching modules that more closely mirror modern neuroscience research laboratories. The project integrates the study of mutant and transgenic animals with classical neurophysiological training programs. Classical teaching approaches typically focus on WHAT neurons do, rather than HOW neurons do what they do.  This project addresses the need for teaching materials that address this HOW.  The mutants selected display specific effects that illustrate the function of key neuronal components such as ion channels, vesicle fusion proteins and cell adhesion molecules. Students moreover perform extracellular recordings on the Drosophila eye to learn about sensory physiology, and intracellular recordings on the larval neuromuscular junction to learn about synaptic transmission and electrical properties of excitable cells. These experiments will be accompanied by assessment of behavioral deficiencies.  \r\n\r\nThe project will monitor and evaluate the success of the integrative teaching approach used through examination of student satisfaction and learning throughout the progress of the course.  These data will be used to modify the content and presentation.  The long term impact of this course will be evaluated, with a special focus on those groups of students that have historically lagged behind in STEM disciplines.  Specific tools for objective assessment of student achievement in this course will be developed and should prove to be broadly useful to neurophysiology course evaluation.  Commitments to dissemination include: workshops for students and faculty at area colleges which will allow for the design of widely applicable teaching techniques; establishment of a free website containing teaching tutorials and video footage of critical steps and techniques; use of the website for collaborations in developing molecular genetic teaching tools for neurophysiology; presentation of laboratory modules at annual meetings of the Society for Neuroscience; and publication in journals such as the Journal of Undergraduate Neuroscience Education and CBE Life Sciences Education.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this project is responsive to a growing need for exemplary learning materials for the increasingly popular neuroscience major.",

Neuroscience is quickly gaining popularity within STEM disciplines, and the number of undergraduate neuroscience programs is rapidly rising. Neurophysiology laboratories are a key component of these programs, often focusing on classical preparations.  Much of modern neuroscience, however, focuses on genetically modifiable model organisms, exploring the nervous system by systematically changing or ablating neuronal components using the tools of molecular genetics. While excellent teaching material had been available for classical neurophysiology, there has been a need for neurophysiology teaching tools that demonstrate the power of molecular genetic manipulations. The main objective of this proposal has been to develop such tools, and to do so while fostering critical thinking skills within the framework of research-like experiences. This project allowed us to establish a fully functioning, state of the art neurophysiology laboratory that serves as our primary means for hands-on training of neuroscience undergraduates.  The laboratory first teaches students the basics of neurophysiology within the framework of a few experiments that cover a variety of techniques.  In addition, over the duration of this grant we have been able to develop a variety of teaching modules that guide students towards applying newly acquired neurophysiology techniques to authentic research questions, or to questions that closely track current research.  During this project the neurophysiology laboratory has become the core of the entire neuroscience program, assuring that all neuroscience majors gain hands on research experience and a true understanding of what it takes to acquire novel knowledge.  Since the design of the course is modeled on active laboratory research, each student group, as a part of this course, spent significant time on projects of their own design.  Summative evaluation and comparison to other laboratory classes showed that our approach leads to enhanced engagement and content knowledge and our students were more likely to work with other students on projects outside of class than students from other courses.  Through the development and dissemination of our teaching modules we have been able to gain recognition for the development of undergraduate neurophysiology teaching material and the PI has become part of nationally recognized teaching workshops in the field.\n\n           Throughout this project we have trained over 280 undergraduate students, and worked closely with 18 undergraduate and 4 graduate students on specific teaching related projects.  The University of Cincinnati \u00e6s urban West Campus attracts a sizeable number of first generation and / or underrepresented minority students.  The interdisciplinary nature of our training program, along with the use of state of the art molecular methods and the opportunity to design and execute independent research projects, has, based on internal surveys and student feedback, undoubtedly advanced our student\u00c6s ability to think critically and become scientific literate citizens. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/21/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elke Buschbeck"
