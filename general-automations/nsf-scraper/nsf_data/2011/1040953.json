 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Comanche Nation College (CNC) and Oklahoma State University (OSU) will establish an Undergraduate Research and Mentoring (URM) program at these two collaborating institutions. The 5-year URM program is aimed at increasing the number of American Indians who pursue graduate degrees in the biological sciences. The PIs plan to engage a total of 4 cohorts, each comprised of 3 undergraduates for a period of 24 months at CNC, and a total of 3 cohorts of 5 students each for a period of 36 months at OSU.  The PIs expect this project to serve a total of 15-27 undergraduate students over a period of 5 years. Students at CNC who complete their associate's degree in the biological sciences can continue in the program to complete their bachelor's degree at OSU; however, students from other two-year schools are also eligible to participate. Undergraduate students will participate in research under the mentorship of faculty at both institutions. In addition to research, students will receive professional development and scientific communication training that will allow them to competitively apply to graduate programs and present the results of their research at conferences and to the public. Students will be recruited to CNC from high schools with high American Indian enrollment through summer camps and to OSU from CNC and other tribal and community colleges in Oklahoma. While students are at CNC and OSU, seminars and workshops will increase awareness of career options, promote interactions between students and professionals, encourage the development of networking skills, and highlight American Indian traditions and customs in the context of biological research. Students will actively participate in research throughout the duration of the program, culminating in student-driven, mentor-guided, independent research projects during their final years at OSU. Student research projects will focus on topics in the area of ecology and environmental stress, such as the effects of biological and environmental stressors (e.g., chemicals, climatic extremes, landscape modifications, management strategies, etc.) on organisms, populations, communities, and ecosystems. A series of workshops will assist students with the graduate school application process, and a capstone course will provide strategies for success in graduate school and beyond. More information is available by contacting Kristen Baum (kristen.baum@okstate.edu) or Donald French (dfrench@okstate.edu) at OSU or Gene Pekah (gpekah@cnc.cc.ok.us) or Consuelo Lopez (clopez@cnc.cc.ok.us) at CNC.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhat are the major goals of the project?\n\n \n\nTo increase the number of Native American students in the Biological Sciences.\nSpecifically, to increase the number of Native American students in Associate Degree programs at Comanche Nation College (CNC) in the Biological Sciences. \nTo increase the number of students transferring through CNC?s partnership with Oklahoma State University in the bridge program, thereby increasing the number of Native American students in four-year Biology degree programs.  \n\n\n \n\nWhat was accomplished under these goals?\n\n \n\nSignificant results:  This academic year, CNC increased the number of Biology students awarded the NSF-URM scholarship from three to five.  These five students have excelled academically in their courses at CNC and have desires to continue their careers in Biology at OSU.  Three of these students graduated from Comanche Nation College with two being accepted into OSU where they have started this Fall 2016 semester.  The remaining graduate was accepted into an INBRE Internship in Oklahoma City and plans to attend nursing school Fall 2016.  \nMajor Activities:  For the year, CNC has maintained a Science Club that meets every two weeks with a faculty member of the OSU Biological Department attending to share their research to the CNC students.  These meetings have provided exceptional guidance and mentorship to the Biology majoring students who get to explore all of the opportunities that a Biology degree provides.  \nKey Outcomes:  Under the guidance of the VP of Student and Academic Affairs, students are better identified and guided through their Biology Degree Program with information about the NSF-URM opportunity and to the benefits of the Science Club.  Overall guidance and support is now directly provided to this NSF-URM grant and this makes for a more productive and efficient way to meet the objectives and goals of the grant.  The scholarship awards have been a key factor in keeping our students in college and have provided the driving force in enabling our students to transfer to OSU.  \n\n\n \n\nWhat opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?\n\n \n\nThe students in the Science Club are given mentoring and professional guidance from the invited Biology professionals who share their experiences in the Biology field.  \nFour URM Scholarship students attended the American Indian Science &amp; Engineering Society Annual Conference in Phoenix, AZ. At the AISES Conference, the students were able to attend valuable workshops on advancing in the world of Science as a Native American, network with other Native Science students, and listen to keynote speakers from their own Native background.  \nTwo students attended the Annual American Indian Higher Education Consortium conference in Minneapolis, MN.  These students were able to participate in the Science Bowl, present their Science posters, and network with other Native American Science majors.   \nOne student, Victoria Martinez, placed 2nd at the Poster contest for the OK-EPSCOR Conference, and she also presented her poster at the Oklahoma Research Day at the Oklahoma State Capitol.  \n\n\n \n\nHow have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?\n\n \n\nThe students who were awarded scholarships, and the news of Victoria Martinez? 2nd place award were publicized in our local city newspaper and also our Comanche Nation Tribal Newsletter.  \n\n\n \n\nWhat do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?\n\n \n\nThis is the final period of the grant. \n\n \n\n \n\nPRODUCTS\n\n \n\n-Nothing to Report\n\n \n\nPARTICIPANTS\n\n \n\nStudents: \n\nJeriah Nelson\n\nMelissa Koehler\n\nMegan Holt\n\nVictoria Martinez\n\nCody Coffman\n\nSummer Morgan\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/06/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Poolaw"
