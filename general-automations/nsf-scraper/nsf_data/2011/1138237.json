 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this NUE in Engineering program entitled, \"NUE: Transforming Nanoscale Science and Engineering Undergraduate Education\", at Columbia University, under the direction of Dr. Chee Wei Wong, is to create an institutionalized cross-disciplinary nanotechnology undergraduate program, reaching across multiple departments to serve a targeted ~90 (25% of cohort) undergraduates. Seven laboratory modules on nanoscale science and engineering will be developed, based on scientific advances by the project team such as in graphene, nanomechanics, nanostructured solar photovoltaics, and nanoelectronics.  These hands-on modules \r\nwill be taught in conjunction with a theoretical numerical simulations class on the foundations of nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe classes will reach out across Columbia University and Barnard College (an undergraduate women's college), and the laboratory modules can further serve as stand-alone experiments in other nanoscale related curricula.  In addition, research experiences for undergraduates will be provided under this program, as well as summer internships at GE Global Research and the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at Brookhaven National Laboratory. All course materials will be made freely available online for broad dissemination.  Lectures in the theoretical foundations class will be recorded and made available for asynchronous download.",
