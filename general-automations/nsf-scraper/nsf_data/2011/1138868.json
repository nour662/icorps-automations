The workshop will be held on June 23-24, 2011 in Washington DC, and will be hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n \r\nOffshore wind and ocean energy is an underdeveloped renewable energy resource.  To develop that resource, research will be required to better understand both the resource (wind, current, wave) and the effect of those resources the on structures that are created to harvest these resources. The workshop will address the fundamental and applied research needs for renewable energy technologies that are likely to be deployed offshore, especially wind and marine hydrokinetic (MHK) energy.  Specific areas for which fundamental information is needed and for which gaps will be identified include forecasting (for operations), energy projections (including resource assessment), technology design and validation, facility design, operations planning/site safety, and performance monitoring.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nOffshore renewable energy is seen as a significant but untapped resource that has the potential to reduce the reliance of the United States on fossil fuels for the generation of electricity.  This proposal will provide travel support to enable the participation of graduate students in a unique workshop that focuses on offshore renewable energy.  This workshop will also foster collaborations between academia, industry, and government, particularly the U.S. DOE and the National Science Foundation (NSF).",
