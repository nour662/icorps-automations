 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project will fund a workshop to bring together individuals from the entertainment and media industries with engineering researchers to strategize about how to utilize public service messages to education Americans about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education; focusing particularly on engineering.  The organizers of the workshop have prior experience in using media for health messaging, and it is anticipated that this workshop can outline how to adopt a similar strategy to address systemic issues in STEM education.  \r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be to leverage existing media to more broadly engage the United States population on the opportunities in, and need for, more engineering-savvy citizens.  Given the focus on the importance of technical innovation for future societal needs, informing a larger portion of the population about the long-term benefits of engineering or themselves pursuing engineering careers can have a significant positive impact.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by building the capacity of the nation's citizenry for addressing societal challenges through engineering.",
