Burns\r\n\r\nSome of the themes emphasized in these research projects are\r\nmodern aspects of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory from the early days\r\nof quantum mechanics in the 1920s, value distribution theory and\r\nAhlfors currents, and Grauert tubes. In physics the\r\nBohr-Sommerfeld theory was created as a method for quantizing an\r\nintegrable classical mechanical system. The principal\r\ninvestigator interprets the Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions for\r\nquantization as a geometric property, name a triviality condition\r\non the holonomy of a certain flat bundle. Ongoing work seeks to\r\nunderstand the connections between singularities of Hamiltonians\r\nand singularities of underlying complex spaces, and the geometry\r\nof the Bohr-Sommerfeld construction seems to be a central focus\r\nof the story.\r\n\r\nValue distribution theory is a framework for attempting to count\r\nsolutions to an equation in complex variables. The Fundamental\r\nTheorem of Algebra tells us that a polynomial equation of degree\r\nn in one variable has exactly n solutions over the complex\r\nnumbers, if you count repeated roots with care. More complicated\r\nequations in a single complex variable can have infinitely many\r\nsolutions, but these are spread around the complex plane and the\r\nnumber of solutions contained in a ball of radius R about the\r\norigin can only grow at a limited rate as R becomes large -- a\r\nsituation greatly clarified by ideas introduced by the Finnish\r\nmathematician Rolf Nevanlinna in the 1920s, at about the same\r\ntime that the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory was developed in physics.\r\nOne of the projects supported by this award is a project that\r\napplies modern geometric tools to study the distribution of\r\nsolutions to equations in several variables.",
