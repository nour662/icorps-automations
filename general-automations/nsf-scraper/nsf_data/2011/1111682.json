 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2011 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) for Adhesion Science will present cutting edge research on soft material physics and mechanics, bio-inspired adhesives and cell adhesion.  The invited speakers representing a variety of scientific disciplines are in the forefront of their field.  The format of GRC (small number of attendees all staying at the same location and attending the same talks, 1 hr talks with ample time for discussion, free afternoons for interaction) are designed to stimulate the free exchange of ideas. To achieve broader impact to education, a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on adhesion science is held one day prior to the GRC at the same location.  The GRS provides a highly-stimulating and non-intimidating environment for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to present their research in talks and poster sessions.  There is also a one hour mentorship session on grant writing and career advancement led by an experienced researcher.  The GRC on Adhesion Science will be held from July 24 - 29 at Bates College, Lewiston, Maine, U.S.A.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this GRC will expand adhesion science into new areas such as cell adhesion and bio-inspired adhesives.  It will lead to new collaborations between adhesion scientists and biologists to solve a new set of technological and scientific problems.  The GRS will allow graduate and postdoctoral students to build informal networks with their peers that may lead to a lifetime of collaboration and scientific achievement.  Since all GRS participants are strongly encouraged to attend the GRC, many of these young researchers will be able to participate in scientific discussions and to socialize with top scholars in different disciplines.  In both conferences, special effort will be made by the chairs to increase the attendance of underrepresented groups and people with disabilities.",
