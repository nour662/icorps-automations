 "awd_abstract_narration": "As semiconductor technology scales to make smaller circuits in order to reduce circuit fabrication costs, a by-product is that it is very hard to make circuit components that match specifications exactly.  Displacement of a single atom can make the circuit behave differently.  The diversity of devices being produced from the same process with the same design makes it un-economical to test them with a \"one size fits all\" test program.  Because each component is unique, we also need a test strategy that is fine-tuned to the circuit being tested.  The proposed work involves adjusting the test program to devices under test iteratively as we gather information about each device throughout the testing process.  \r\n\r\nKeeping a leading edge in information technology is essential for the economical and social well being of the nation.  Our most advanced technologies produce statistically diverse devices from the same design and manufacturing specification.  Future technologies will produce even more diverse devices.  Thorough testing of these increasingly complex devices is a key component in maintaining an edge in information technology.  This project will explore new testing methodologies by developing methods to enable a shift from static to dynamic test procedures.  In addition, this project will pilot a set of undergraduate design projects involving collaboration between Georgia Tech and Arizona State to mimic the prevalent need to collaborate over long distances in industry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nElectronic circuits are now a component of almost any equipment set available on the market.  The overall goal of this project is to enable the design and manufacturing of lower cost, smaller form-factor electronic circuits. \n\nAlthough the use of advanced technologies lowers the cost of producing electronics circuits, a major challenge with the design and manufacturing of circuits using the most advanced technologies is the increasing variability of component (transistor and interconnect) performances and degrading reliability of components.  The current method to handle these problems is through \"corner simulations\" for process parameter variations and the use of de-rating factors for reliability.  The \"corner simulation\" methodology requires circuit designers to ensure that the circuit works and achieves performance requirements at a set of extreme process parameters (the corners).  The use of de-rating factors requires that the circuit designers ensure that the circuit works for a higher operating frequency/supply voltage than used in normal operations.  The problem is that the use of corner simulations and de-rating factors results in over-design, which means that circuits achieve less performance (low power, high operating frequency) and/or take longer to design than is feasible.\n\nThis project has developed statistical timing and reliability analysis tools.  The tools that have been developed provide a better method to determine the range of a circuit's performances as a result of process variations and improved selection of test patterns to determine if a circuit meets performance requirements.  The tools also provide a method to estimate circuit parameters so that test patterns can be optimized for groups of circuits with similar process parameters, which in turn reduces test and manufacturing cost by shortening manufacturing test time.   \n\nThis project has also incorporated wearout in statistical timing analysis.  The resulting tools determine a circuit's lifetime as a function of its performance specifications.  The tools optimize the selection of de-rating factors for a variety of use scenarios.  Additionally, the tools enable the optimization of a design at the target lifetime. Such a methodology provides more certainty that a circuit will achieve the target lifetime at the required ppm rate.  Ensuring that a circuit achieves a target lifetime at the required ppm rate is especially important for high reliability applications, such as in the space, medical, avionics, and automotive domains.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Linda Milor"
