 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to create a new class of Si-based electroabsorption modulators (EAM) that operate at an unprecedented bandwidth of 80Gb/s.  The approach is to use 3D wafer bonding technology to vertically couple light into a nanowire high-index contrast silicon waveguide.  A graded base SiGe heterojunction transistor is the baseline electric structure of the modulator, while the free carrier plasma effect is used to generate optical absorption modulation. \r\nIntellectual merits: For high capacity fiber-optic systems, a Si-based, monolithically integrated fast EAM is an appealing alternative technology to commercial III-V compound semiconductor based modulators. The proposed research will explore the carrier transport phenomena and its corresponding optical attenuation effect in a SiGe heterojuction transistor, as well as various design trade-offs among modulation depth, signal dispersion, operation speed, power consumption, and local heating effects. The proposed work will design a fully integrated modulator driver circuit using unmodified, silicon fabrication processes. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: An 80Gbps, low-power, and small footprint Si based EAM will be a breakthrough technology in advancing the development of the next generation of broadband fiber-optic networking and lightwave circuits for high-speed computing. There is a strong, synergistic educational and mentoring component for students at all levels. Outreach efforts will broaden participation of under-represented groups and undergraduate students in research programs at both institutions. K-12 outreach activities will be in collaboration with New York New Vision program at RPI, and through the Center for Engineering Educational Outreach (CEEO) at Tufts.",

An Electro-Absorption Modulator (EAM), offering unprecedented operation speed and utmost low-cost solution, is a crucial fiber-optic component in readying the fiber-optic community for the next generation of fiber technology.\n\n \n\nIn this project, the utility of a SixGe1-x  heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT) for an EAM modulator in combination with an optical substrate inspires a drastically novel approach to optical component design.

In this research project, several novel transmitter driver architectures have been designed and realized to enable monolithic integration with the HBT-based EAM device.  A 10Gbps monolithic optical transmitter module integrating the driver circuit architecture was design, fabricated in a 130nm BiCMOS process, and tested.

The driver IC incorporates an integrated 27-1 pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) generator for reliable high-speed testing, and a driver circuit featuring digitally-tuned pre-emphasis signal strength for fast switching speeds.
