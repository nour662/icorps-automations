 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a small workshop project to support the participation of Arctic indigenous scholars and students in a discussion of Arctic sustainability. The workshop is to be held in Krasnoyarsk, Russia following the larger international conference, \"Arctic: A Territory of Dialogue.\"  The main theme of interest from this conference to be discussed at the Krasnoyarsk workshop is:  How science and communities can collaborate on topics crucial to the vision of Arctic sustainability - key topics to be discussed are:  how short lived climate forcers impact climate change; impacts of seismic exploration on marine mammals, fisheries and other subsistence resources; the observed changes in Pacific walrus populations in relationship to climate change; the broader Russian national vision of the Arctic, e.g., resource development in a changing Arctic and the cross boarder national Beringia park, to name a few. \r\n\r\nPacific Environment will facilitate the participation of over 40 scientists, indigenous leaders, policy experts, and students in the workshop.  Following the workshop PE will continue web-based communication forums among the participants and implement a \"Young Leaders'\" program that continues to facilitate indigenous youth participation in future workshops on key issues affecting their communities.",
