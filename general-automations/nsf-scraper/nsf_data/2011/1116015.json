 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at a systematic approach that integrates multi-level IC design automation \r\nflow by leveraging the parallel computational power in current and upcoming multi-core/many-core \r\nprocessors. The main challenge in this approach is to provide responsive high-level design decisions \r\nwhile incurring the massive computational cost of lower-level design algorithms. Fortunately, recent \r\ntrends in processor architectures provide a solution. Compared with traditional uniprocessor systems, \r\nemerging multi-core/many-core microprocessors have far more computational power but limited global \r\nmemory access capabilities. Parallel computational power may make it possible to break \r\nthe boundaries of the existing IC design hierarchy and to vertically integrate the IC optimization fow. \r\nThe potential benefits of an integrated solution are significant - accurate high-level design decisions \r\nbecome possible as low-level design details are derived concurrently, and low-level designs can also \r\ngreatly benefit from high-quality high-level decisions. Together, an efficient and high-quality design flow \r\nbecomes feasible, making design closure faster, thus saving time and reducing costs.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work has the potential to overcome the key limitations of existing hierarchical IC CAD \r\ntechnologies and enable new IC design automation solutions, which in turn can benefit the IC and \r\nsemiconductor industry. The PIs will work together with their industrial collaborators to develop and\r\ncommercialize the proposed work. The project will have beneficial impact on education.\r\nThe PIs intend to educate the next generation of software developers and practicing engineers \r\nin the design and innovation of IC design automation and parallel computing.",
