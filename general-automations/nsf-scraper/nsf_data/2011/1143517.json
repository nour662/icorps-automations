The effort will be led by a five person steering committee who will organize and hold a series of workshops and discussion groups at multiple scientific-society meetings over the next two years, culminating in a Frontiers of Ecosystem Science Symposium. Relevant target societies include American Geophysical Union, American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, American Society of Microbiology, Ecological Society of America, Estuarine Research Federation, North American Benthological Society, International Society for Microbial Ecology, International Association of Landscape Ecology, Association of American Geographers and the Soil Science Society of America.  Project outcomes will include a workshop report, as well one or more peer reviewed publications that would serve as to guide future directions in ecosystem science and related disciplines.\r\n \r\nAs research is becoming more interdisciplinary, particularly the science of global environmental change, ecosystem scientists often find themselves in positions of intellectual and organizational leadership because of their experience working across disciplines. Ecosystem science has a long history as a core area of investigative research, and has never been more relevant to the needs of society and the nation.  All activities in this project will involve a gender-balanced assemblage of early-career and established investigators, participation by students and postdoctoral researchers, and members from underrepresented groups in science.",

Extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of presentations, discussions and participant surveys was used to define frontiers, capacity building and barriers in the field of Ecosystem Science.  \n\nWe learned through surveys, soapbox talks, community engagement at townhalls, and expert interviews that \"energizing\" the research agenda is not really necessary; there are many ideas, and tremendous energy and excitement about research in ecosystem ecology.\n\nThe \"core\" of ecosystem ecology is robust.  With the application of new tools and new approaches, it is possible to unravel the details of some important topics in ecosystems, for example, the nature and impact of state changes, thresholds, and tipping points.   There is also excellent and ongoing work on the \"drivers\" of change, such as climate, land use, and invasive species.  \n\nWhat is both surprising&mdash;and not&mdash;is that there is impressive ongoing work on fundamental processes  and unanswered  questions that underpin life, such as the controls and feedbacks on production, consumption, decomposition, nutrient cycling, and energy dynamics in human-dominated as well as \u00e6natural\u00c6 systems.\n\nNew tools and technologies are increasingly available (e.g., sensors, genomics, new techniques for data analysis) that are being integrated into ecosystem experiments, models, long-term data, comparative studies, and used to test theory, that are fundamental to new knowledge on ecosystem structure and function.
