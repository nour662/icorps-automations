 "awd_abstract_narration": "The generation of new knowledge in today's highly globalized society requires scientists and scholars, universities, R&D business, and federal agencies to promote international research collaborations as a way to enhance intellectual capacity and increase competitiveness.  The Association of American Geographers (AAG) will continue to help geographers in t he United States develop international collaboration through formal activities sponsored by the International Geographic Union (IGU).  This award will support 145 United States geographic scholars (72 junior and 73 senior scholars) through partial-travel support to attend IGU Congresses in 2012 and 2016 and three IGU regional conferences in the intervening years.  Thirty scholars will attend the IGU Congress in Koln, Germany in 2012, 25 scholars will attend each of the regional conferences in Kyoto, Japan (2013), Krakow, Poland (2014), Moscow, Russia (2015), and 40 scholars will attend the 2016 IGU Congress in Beijing, China.  The support provided through this award will provide benefits to individual researchers and the broader geographic community by stimulating scholarly publications; by fostering collaborative, multinational research and improving geographic education.  The award also will contribute to human resource development, including international scientific leadership and the broad enrichment of geography and related fields in the U.S.\r\n\r\nWidespread participation of U.S. geographers in these International Geographical Union-sponsored conferences will strengthen U.S. ties with international scholars.  Early-career scholars are provided professional development opportunities through participation in international events.  In follow-up surveys of individuals supported with previous support to IGU conferences, 80 percent of the respondents stated that their teaching activities were enhanced by their participation by their international experiences.  Such successes demonstrate that this travel-support program can help develop collaborations that result in a technical knowledge base that can translate research and development into useful applications for solving societal problems.  American scholars also are provided with unique opportunities for outreach, positive engagement, and improved research programs through partnerships in the regions where the conferences are help.",

As evidenced below, this program has increased US participation in these international events and fostered international collaboration in research and teaching through the production of scholarly publications and through the integration of discovery with educational activities of participants. \n\nThe AAG requests funds of $208,060 from the NSF to directly support 145 grantees to attend various annual IGU events over a five-year period from 2012 to 2016. An expected 72 junior scholars and 73 senior scholars will receive partial travel support to attend the 2012 IGU Congress in K&ouml;ln, Germany (30 total participants); the IGU Regional Conferences in Kyoto, Japan, 2013; in Krakow, Poland, 2014; in Moscow, Russia, 2015 (25 participants each); and the 2016 IGU Congress in Beijing, China (40 participants).

Select improvements will be made by initiating efforts for broadening participation in the solicitation process, by standardizing formal participant reporting mechanisms, and by disseminating results online via the AAG?s new website.\n\nThe scientific merit of the program will be to continue to generate contributions to resources for research and education, including stimulating scholarly publications, fostering collaborative, multi-national research, and improving geographic education and contributions to human resource development, as well as promoting US international scientific leadership. The broader impacts of sustaining US engagement in these international events include contributions to the enrichment of US science, for geography and other disciplines as well as contributions beyond science and engineering that relate to the long term goals of NSF, AAG, and IGU.\n\nNote: the original 2012 &ndash; 2016 Award duration was extended to 2018.

This brought the total of U.S. scholar participation in the period of 2012 &ndash; 2018 to a grand total of 153.\n\n \n\nProject Outcomes Report\n\nThis funding from the National Science Foundation enabled the Association of American Geographers (AAG) to manage a travel grant program to support the participation of 153 U.S. geographers in six major events of the International Geographical Union (IGU).  The IGU is the global organization that promotes worldwide scientific exchange and collaboration on topics of interest to the field of geography and is a member of the International Council for Science (ICSU).  The events were held in Germany, Japan, Poland, Russia, China and Canada. \n\nThe participation of these scholars, which include senior and junior faculty and graduate students, in these high-level IGU events is significant for several reasons, including:\n\nToday?s globalized society and increasingly-connected world is having a significant impact on research-oriented organizations such as universities, R&amp;D enterprises, and government agencies.  Accordingly, these institutions are promoting international research collaboration as a means of building intellectual capacity and increasing U.S. competitiveness.  The travel of 153 American scholars from a wide range of U.S. institutions of higher education to a series of key international conferences helps strengthen research collaboration and scientific exchange.    \nAttendance at major international geography conferences enables U.S. geographers &ndash; including junior faculty &ndash; to seek opportunities to serve as international leaders in the discipline.  A number of participants reported taking on roles as scientific research commission chairs or even officers.  This is a key aspect of professional development and allows American geographers to play a lead part in IGU activities as well as other important leadership positions and influence global scientific research.\n\n\nThe AAG is a nonprofit scientific and educational society founded in 1904 to promote the advancement of geography.  Our members, representing all fifty states, are geographers and related professionals who work in the public, private, and academic sectors.  Their career fields include college and university faculty members; scientific researchers; federal, state, and local government employees; planners; cartographers; businesspeople; and elementary and secondary educators.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas B Richardson"
