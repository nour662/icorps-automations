 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2012 Joint Statistical Meetings Diversity Workshop and Mentoring Program is a multi-day activity which will take place during the 2012 Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) in San Diego.  It will consist of a series of interactive sessions and small group mentoring activities which aim to \r\n\r\n1.\tEstablish critical mentoring and networking relationships for minority statisticians at early- to mid-career levels (i.e., undergraduate students, graduate students, early statistics professionals);\r\n2.\tMotivate students to pursue graduate study and careers in statistics;\r\n3.\tShare best practices for recruiting and mentoring minority students and faculty; and\r\n4.\tIncrease the active participation of minorities in the American Statistical Association.\r\n\r\nParticipants in the workshop and mentoring program include underrepresented minority graduate students in statistics or biostatistics programs; top minority undergraduates in statistics, mathematics, or related disciplines; minority statisticians in academia, government, and the private sector; key faculty from minority-serving institutions who advise and mentor undergraduates in math or related disciplines; and faculty influential in the faculty and/or student recruitment processes at their home institutions.\r\n\r\nThis program is unique in that it does not limit its focus to students only, but also provides opportunities to benefit early career professionals.  It is further unique in its holistic approach to career development which allows individuals to participate in the program as both mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 simultaneously.  These elements help create a community of support and accountability for the success of all involved.\r\n\r\nThis awarded is supported jointly by the Infrastructure Program and the Statistics Program within the Division of Mathematics.",

Eleven mentor-mentee pairs participated in the program, along with additional guests and invited contributors.  The program opened with a welcome dinner, where mentors and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s met, and included three scheduled sessions for the entire mentor and prot&eacute;g&eacute; group.  On Monday morning, participants heard from Drs. Jesse Ng (NC State University), Maisha Gray-Diggs (Procter and Gamble), and Brian Millen (Lilly) on the topics of Career Search and Keys to Career Success.  On Tuesday, participants heard from Drs. Sydeaka Watson (Univ of Chicago), Kimberly Weems (NC State University), Jeffrey Wilson (Arizona State University), Neal Jeffries (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute), and Dionne Swift (Procter and Gamble) who shared various career paths for individuals with statistics degrees.  On Wednesday, participants took part in a round-table discussion on issues proposed by the prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.  In addition to the scheduled sessions, mentors and mentees met one-to-one throughout the meeting and participated in some JSM activities together, such as the JSM opening mixer and the ASA Committee on Minorities in Statistics\u00c6 networking mixer. Evaluations of the program indicate that the sessions met the learning objectives and were very well-received by both the mentees and the mentors.  \nFollow-up from the program has revealed enduring relationships between mentors and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.  In addition, the group uses social media to stay connected with one another.\n\n \nThe 2012 JSM Diversity Workshop and Mentoring Program took place Sunday, July 29 through Wednesday, August 1, 2012 at the Joint Statistical Meetings in San Diego, California.  Approximately 75 individuals participated in the program.  A summary of the program sessions is given below.\n \nSunday (full-day workshop):\n \nKeynote address by Jackie Hughes-Oliver, Professor of Statistics, North Carolina State University.\nDr. Hughes spoke from the topic \"Success is a journey, not a destination.\"  Through metaphor of successful travel she talked about career success from student life through post-graduate life.  She also shared the troubling statistics on the lack of diversity for mathematics and statistics PhD\u00c6s awarded, as well as the inspirational stories of pioneering statisticians of color such as David Blackwell.\n \nCareer Success: Tips and Traps\nA panel of successful statisticians in academia, government and industry offered advice for career success and responded to audience questions.  The role of mentoring throughout ones career was a prominent theme.  Panelists included Dr. Sastry Pantula (NSF, NC State), Dr. Bob Bell (AT&amp;T Labs), Dr. Dionne Price (FDA), Dr. Alicia Carriquiry (Iowa State University), Dr. Tommy Wright (US Census Bureau), and Dr. Nancy Geller (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute).\n \nGraduate School Success\nA panel of current and recent graduate students, as well as select faculty members, offered candid feedback and advice to current students.\n \nMentoring Overview\nRic Weibl of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) offered foundational principles for mentoring relationships .  Immediately following his presentation, mentors and mentees were matched to make initial connections.  One-to-one mentoring discussions then occurred throughout the JSM conference.\n \nDynamics of Trust\nDr. Brian Millen (Lilly) facilitated a discussion on the importance of trust in workplace relationships, potential cross-cultural barriers to trust, and tools for giving and earning trust in the workplace.  The session consisted o..."
