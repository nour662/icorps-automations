 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor David Giedroc and colleagues Lyudmila Bronstein, Daniel Mindiola, Maren Pink and Sara Skrabalak from Indiana University will acquire an X-ray powder diffractometer equipped with a variable temperature system. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) magnetic nanoparticles as building blocks in advanced materials, (b) characterization of inorganic solids for photocatalytic applications by powder X-ray diffraction, (c) self-assembly of chiral discotic molecules: powder XRD for structure analysis of nanofibers and organogels, (d) study of phase transitions with variable temperature X-ray powder diffraction, (e) in-situ investigations of solid state reactions, \r\n\r\nAn X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules in single crystals or in crystalline powdered samples. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns can also be used to elucidate the structure and relative abundance of the crystalline phases in a sample, it can expose the existence of preferred crystalline orientation (called texture) of a film of a material relative to a crystalline substrate surface, and the XRD linewidth can provide an estimate of the mean crystallite (or grain) diameter. In addition, the structure of extremely thin films (<100 nm) of materials can be investigated by powder-XRD whereas such films cannot be probed by single-crystal XRD. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, as well as materials chemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and will also be available to collaborators and students via cyber-enabling.",
