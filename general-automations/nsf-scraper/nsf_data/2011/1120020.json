 "awd_abstract_narration": "1120020\r\nDunn-Rankin\r\n\r\nThis proposal is for support of US students and junior researchers to attend the International Colloquium on the Dynamics of Explosions and Reactive Systems (ICDERS).  The meeting is held biannually in the years when the Combustion Symposium is not held. The host organization is formally the Institute for the Dynamics of Explosions and Reactive Systems (IDERS, a non-profit organization registered in the state of Washington, USA, but the conference is essentially organized by the hosting institution. The 23rd ICDERS meeting will be held at the University of California, Irvine, July 24-29, 2011. It has been 10 years since the meeting was last held in the United States. Recent prior Symposia include: Minsk, Belarus, 2009; Poitiers, France, 2007; Montreal, Canada, 2005; Hakone, Japan, 2003.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nICDERS is the longest running specialist meeting of the Combustion Institute, and is the most important international meeting on combustion and explosions that focuses on the dynamic elements of reactive systems. It focuses on combustion and explosion dynamics, the following lists the topics from the session titles at the most recent past meeting in Minsk: 1) Deflagration-Detonation Transition; 2) Detonation - Structure; 3) Modeling of Reactive Systems; 4) Jet Ignition; 5) Combustion Induced Vortex Breakdown; 6) Flames in IC Engines; 7) Multiphase Reactive System; 8) Diagnostics; 9) Fires; 10) Pulsed Detonation Engines and Rotating Detonation Engines; 11) Fast Flames; 12) Ignition; 13) Soot; 14) Flames; 15) Hydrocarbon Ignition and Combustion; 16) Detonation Initiation; 17) Numerical Simulation; 18) Detonation Structure and Chemical Reaction; 19) Detonation Multiphase; 20) Electric and Magnetic Effects; 21) Flame Instabilities; 22) Flames in Channels; 23) Chemical Kinetics; 24) Explosions; 25) Micro and Mesoscale Combustion; 26) Multiphase Combustion; 27) Various other Topics.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe current plan includes (1) a special grad-student/post-doc poster session and reception that allows younger scientists to interact directly with each other. (2) Discounted registration for selected U.S. researchers who have recently graduated (since they cannot get the student rate and might not have the resources for a full registration to present material that is not associated with their current position). (3) Graduate student registration waivers for student presenters to encourage their attendance and participation.",
