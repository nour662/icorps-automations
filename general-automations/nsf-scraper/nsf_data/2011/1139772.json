This program builds on previous program\r\nefforts that have not only significantly added to the graduate enrollment and masters\r\nand doctoral degrees to students from underreprested minority (UREP) populations but\r\nhave also led to important changes in the culture and practice of STEM education in\r\nways that not only help UREP students but all graduate STEM students.\r\nThe project adds to current efforts by SUNY LSAMP to build research capacity in STEM\r\neducation in the area of graduate education. The lessons learned from the study of the\r\nBridge to the Doctorate Program will be put into the context of broader issues of\r\nsystemic change and disseminated to a broad national audience.\r\nUsing the lessons learned from this project, the alliance expects to continue to develop\r\nand refine strategies that will increase the recruitment and retention of graduate\r\nstudents and further diversify graduate education departments. The strategy has the\r\npotenital to increase the number of UREP STEM students who successfully complete\r\ndoctoral degrees in STEM disciplines and make changes in STEM departmental culture\r\nand practice.",
