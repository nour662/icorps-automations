The applicant plans to work at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics on the SPUD Array, a new set of receivers that will observe from the South Pole aiming to discover the first direct signature of Inflation: the primordial B-mode polarization imprint left behind in the CMB. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is to directly probe the Universe through the data analysis effort drawn from the applicant's experience in particle physics while developing new analysis tools. For the broader impact, the applicant plans writing for the Exploratorium?s Web site \"Ice Stories: Dispatches from Polar Scientists\", which shares stories about astrophysical research in Antarctica. She also plans to be a Worldwide Telescope Ambassador, giving public presentations and adding images from Antarctic-based telescopes to the Worldwide Telescope?s computer-based astronomy visualization tools for education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs a postdoctoral fellow working on BICEP2 and the Keck Array, I worked toward tackling some of the most exciting questions about the nature of the universe at the beginning of time.  Through direct measurements, we look for evidence of the widely-held theory that the universe underwent rapid, exponential expansion during the first moments of time.\n\nBICEP2 and the Keck Array are a set of telescopes that observe the sky from the South Pole, making extremely sensitive measurements of the oldest light in the universe, called the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).  This oldest light was created about 400,000 years after the Big Bang, when the universe had expanded and cooled enough that the electrons and protons in the plasma could combine to form neutral hydrogen, allowing the CMB to travel unimpeded through the universe ever since.  These telescopes look for a slight twist the polarization pattern of the CMB that would allow us to learn about a time much earlier than when the CMB itself was created.  A twist in the polarization pattern of the CMB would be evidence of a period called inflation in the extremely early universe: a period when the universe expanded an enormous amount in the first tiny fraction of a second (10-38 seconds after the Big Bang). \n\nDetection of this twist in the CMB left over from inflation would herald a new era in cosmology, providing direct evidence for the theory of inflation, determining the energy scale of inflation, providing the first direct image of gravitational waves, and giving direct empirical evidence for quantum gravity.\n\nBICEP2 has recently announced the first detection of this twisted signature in the CMB, consistent with the expected signal from a period of inflation in the extremely early universe.   Although we await confirmation of our detection by other experiments, we look forward to this new era of cosmology where we can probe physics at the energy scale of inflation, 12 orders of magnitude greater than the highest energies we can achieve on earth (at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN).  With further measurements with the Keck Array, BICEP3, and beyond, we hope to learn about the physics that drove inflation at the earliest times.\n\nThis discovery, if confirmed, will have profound impact on our understanding of cosmology and particle physics.  The announcement captured the imagination of the public, bringing cutting-edge science to the front page of newspapers across the world.\n\nAs a postdoctoral fellow on BICEP2 and the Keck Array, I led the optical characterization effort for the Keck Array and am the coordinator for the beam characterization analysis effort for BICEP2.  The goal of these efforts is to fully characterize the instruments and ensure that we can achieve our full sensitivity without creating false signals in the instruments.  I have also spent three seasons installing, upgrading, and characterizing and optimizing the performance of Keck Array receivers at South Pole.  The Keck Array is currently in its third year of operation with the full suite of receivers, and has achieved unprecedented sensitivity.\n\nDuring my tenure as a postdoctoral fellow, I was a WorldWide telescope ambassador, and I spent two years participating in a six-week program at the Clarke Middle School in Lexington, MA.  Once a week, I helped sixth grade students do research projects on a topic of their choosing in Astronomy.

I also worked with a high school student to incorporate data from BICEP1 directly into the WorldWide telescope software for inclusion in standard WorldWide telescope releases.\n\nI currently volunteer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, participating in the Astronomy Conversations program, in which I talk to museum-goers in a casual setting, answering questions about astronomy and discus..."
