 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Carolina Central University's Targeted Infusion Project entitled -  Enrichment of the B.S. Chemistry Program through the Implementation of Forensic Science Concentration at North Carolina Central University - has the goal to transform the curriculum and to increase enrollment in the B.S. Chemistry program by implementing a forensic science concentration. The increasing public visibility of state-of-the-art forensic methods is reflected by the growing number of inquiries regarding the forensic science concentration from prospective and incoming students at NCCU. In response to these external demands, the Department of Chemistry established the forensic science concentration within the Chemistry degree program in 2009.\r\n\r\nThe activities to accomplish the project's goal are: to develop and implement a capstone forensic science course which encompasses integrated scenario-based lecture and laboratories; transform the current Chemistry curriculum by infusing modern forensic analytical, physical, and bioanalytical techniques into various courses; expand research and internship opportunities for undergraduate students; and implement outreach activities for high school students centered around the forensic science concentration to increase the enrollment in the B.S. Chemistry program.  The outcome expected from this project is that the students graduating from this program, who are mostly from groups underrepresented forensic chemistry, will be trained in forensic science and will be able to transition into either graduate and professional schools or the workforce.",
