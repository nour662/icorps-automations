 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF ERC for Ultra-wide-area Resilient Electric Energy Transmission Network (CURENT) will develop transforming technologies to allow reliable operation of the electric transmission infrastructure across vast distances and over multiple time scales. Perhaps the most important technical challenge over the next several decades will be how to address energy needs without heavy reliance on fossil fuels. The electric power system transmission infrastructure must play a critical role in any viable solution. Unfortunately, the power grid is aging and already operating outside its design limits. Desired performance in efficiency, reliability, and security cannot be attained when renewable sources such as, wind and solar, reach significant levels that will add complexity and uncertainty to system operation. Allowing greater control of demand with smart metering provides an excellent opportunity. Yet, the core challenge facing operation of an extremely large, complex electric network with tens of thousands of transmission lines, buses and potentially millions of control points, remains unaddressed. Ultra-wide-area coordination for system operation is critically needed to avoid future transmission network instabilities and congestion bottlenecks and to minimize the risk of cascading failures. This ERC will seek the fundamental breakthroughs and investigate the enabling technologies needed to achieve a resilient transmission network on a continental scale, while educating a new generation of electric power and energy systems engineering leaders with a global perspective coming from diverse backgrounds. Specifically, the proposed ERC research will:\r\n--Develop new systems methodologies to take advantage of advancements in wide-area measurement and communication to allow coordinated action on a continental ultra-wide scale. Cost effective, Global Positioning System (GPS) time synchronized, wide-area measurements with milliseconds data rate can transform today's granular Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system into a high resolution system, enabling dynamic observation and control.\r\n--Flatten the control and information structure so it is less hierarchical and can replace, at all levels of the power grid, traditional inflexible operations strategies. The existing grid controls need to be replaced by a simpler, flatter structure of local control operating with guidance from global situational awareness.\r\n--Draw on high performance computing capability to realize large-scale and faster-than-real-time simulation for predictive control (and fast response) to ensure secure and reliable operation. Real-time calculation of the \"dynamic state\" of the grid on a continental scale will be feasible.\r\n--Investigate the use of widely allocated high power electronic actuators coupled with transmission level energy storage to stabilize grids during disturbances and moderate supply-demand imbalances resulting in high speed power flow control for full use of assets across the interconnected system.",

Traditional controls replaced by a simpler, flatter structure of local control operating with guidance from global situational awareness;\nadvanced functionality power electronic actuators to stabilize grids during disturbances and moderate supply-demand imbalances allowing for high speed reconfigurability to realize full use of assets across the interconnected system; and\nhigh performance computing capability to enable large-scale and faster-than-real-time simulation for predictive control to ensure secure and reliable operation. \n\n\nCURENT research is a systems approach to address the challenges of wide area control of the large and complex power grid. The Center approach has been needed in order to: (1) have a sufficiently large and diverse team of researchers to address multiple technical challenges; (2) interact closely with industry in understanding practical system issues; and (3) create the innovative culture needed to transform a large legacy system. The Center identified the following specific goals for performance indicators for the future power system:\n\nallow renewable sources to provide 80% of power or greater, without impacting reliability, \nincrease load participation for wide-area dynamic control by an order of magnitude, \nincrease transmission capacity utilization by 30%, \nreduce carbon emissions consistent with the Paris agreement on climate change, \nachieve nation-wide grid situational awareness at all control centers, \ndevelop resiliency approaches for extreme events, and\nreduce the rate of major power blackouts by 80%. \n\n\nWe have identified research milestones needed to reach these goals:\n\na distributed control architecture and design methodology, which allows simple low cost control designs to facilitate renewable integration and demand response with limited communication while supporting system needs;\nnew high resolution measurement technologies for synchronized measurements and other sensing technologies;\nadvanced actuation capabilities in inverter designs to support system functions;\nnew transmission system architectures, such as HVDC overlays and multi-terminal HVDC, that can more fully utilize system capacity;\nnew controls and overall designs that support resiliency in the face of extreme events, such as hurricanes and state sponsored cyberattacks;\nan information system and data architecture that satisfies latency and situational awareness needs;\nnew data analytic methods to support all aspects of power system decision-making;\nremedial control actions to prevent cascading outages using wide-area measurements; \nuse of high performance computing to realize large-scale and faster-than-real-time simulation for predictive control coupled with new visualization tools;\nmeasurement based approaches to mitigate cybersecurity threats to grid operation;\nmarket structures and incentives to ensure optimal pricing, adequate investment in the transmission network, more rapid adoption of renewable technologies, and an understanding of the social benefits of the transformed infrastructure; and\nan understanding of the societal and behavioral factors that ease the adoption of grid developments, such as extensive demand response and variability of supply.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/26/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin L Tomsovic"
