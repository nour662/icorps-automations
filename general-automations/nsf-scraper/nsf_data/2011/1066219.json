The aim of the workshop is to make progress on the core theory while at the same time expanding applications. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together both an international group consisting of experienced and junior researchers, including graduate students, and postdocs to discuss recent work and advances.  For graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty this should serve as a springboard for their future in the professions. Priority for funding will be given to graduate students, other young researchers and participants without other support as well as members of groups underrepresented in mathematics",
