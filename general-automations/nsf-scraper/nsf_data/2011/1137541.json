The Department of Computer Science enrolls about 250 undergraduate majors, most of whom are African-American.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this proposal are to: 1) enhance the Virtual Reality course curriculum with more inquiry based problem-solving activities and hand-on experiences based on Virtual and Augmented Reality educational modules; 2) develop the Virtual and Augmented Reality Laboratory for research and education in the Computer Science Department to provide undergraduate students with realistic immersive learning environments; and 3) acquire instrumentation to further develop the teaching and research infrastructure in VAR laboratories. The project seeks to prepare computer science majors at BSU to be competitive to enter graduate programs and the workforce.",

The grant has prepared computer science majors at BSU to be competitive to enter graduate programs and the workforce by enhancement of the Virtual Reality (VR) course curriculum with more inquiry based problem-solving activities and hands-on experiences with Virtual and Augmented Reality educational modules. The grant has resulted in publication of 3 journal papers and 18 conference proceedings in national and international conferences. Additionally, the students have presented their research work in 19 posters and oral presentations at conferences and research expos. The grant has funded more than 25 students in 3 years at BSU to work as research assistants and gain research experience by working with hands-on real world projects in the VR Lab. The research work resulted in the development and evaluation of immersive multi-user VR environments (airplane evacuation, subway evacuation, and VR city environment) for performing virtual evacuation drills.
