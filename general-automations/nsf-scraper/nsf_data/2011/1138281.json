In addition to technical sessions of submitted paper presentations, the meeting offers workshops, tutorials, and commercial presentations & exhibits.\r\nIPDPS seeks to increase student participation in symposium and the field.\r\nIt is proposed to offer up to 20 NSF-sponsored student travel for a total budget of $20,000. Applications were solicited via email mailing lists, personal contacts, and the conference web site. The selection process will consider the applicant?s level of participation in IPDPS, followed by how closely the student?s research interests match areas covered by IPDPS.",
