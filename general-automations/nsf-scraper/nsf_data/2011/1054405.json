 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biochar, also known as \"biomass-derived black carbon\", is a charcoal produced by the\r\ncombustion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment (pyrolysis). Recent technological\r\nadvances make it possible to envision the development of an innovative environmental\r\nsustainability strategy to convert carbon-rich agricultural residues (e.g. sugarcane bagasses,\r\nsugar beet residues, peanut hull, and animal waste) into engineered biochars. This\r\nsustainability strategy can produce multiple societal and environmental benefits: sustainable\r\nmanagement of agricultural resources, water conservation and reclamation, sustainable soil\r\nproductivity, carbon neutral energy production, and carbon sequestration. The overall objective\r\nof this project is to build an integrated research and education program focusing on exploring\r\nthe environmental and societal benefits of using carbon-rich agricultural residues as feed stocks\r\nfor engineered biochars.  The specific research objectives are to: 1) Create different types of engineered biochars\r\n(i.e., untreated biochar, biologically activated biochar, and surface-modified biochar) from\r\nrepresentative agricultural residues; 2) Determine fundamental physicochemical properties of\r\nthe engineered biochars; and 3) Unveil mechanisms governing the sorption of contaminants\r\n(i.e., nutrients, pharmaceuticals, and heavy metals) to the engineered biochars.\r\nThe specific educational objectives are to: 1) develop a new course on the impact of\r\nbiochar on environmental sustainability; 2) promote interest and participation of students in\r\nenvironmental sustainability through early exposure; and 3) educate the greater community\r\nabout the environmental and societal benefits of the proposed activities.",
