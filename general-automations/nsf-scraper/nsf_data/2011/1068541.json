 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds theoretical research in several different topics in relativistic astrophysics and general relativity, with a focus on sources of gravitational radiation that might be detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and by the proposed space based detector, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).  The principal topics are: (i) the development of methods to compute the gravitational waveforms from point particles inspiralling into spinning black holes; (ii) the development of theoretical tools for studying tidal interactions of objects with relativistic gravitational fields; (iii) the exploration of properties of black holes in theories with branes and extra dimensions; and (iv) the computation of experimental and theoretical constraints on various alternative theories of gravity that have been proposed as models of the Universe's acceleration.\r\n\r\nThe work on development of computational methods for gravitational waveforms will eventually have a significant impact on gravitational wave astronomy, by facilitating the detection and analysis of gravitational wave signals, from which we can learn about properties of black holes. Education and training of graduate and undergraduate students will be integrated into the research program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project consisted of theoretical research into various aspects of Einstein's general theory of general relativity.  Some of the research helped in the development of accurate theoretical model of sources of gravitational waves, like the collision of two black holes that was recently detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory.  Our research on this topic focused on black hole binaries where one black hole is much smaller than the other, and zooms around at speeds near the speed of light for many cycles before falling into the large black hole.  Accurate theoretical models will be helpful for detecting signals and using them to test general relativity.\n\n \n\nAnother focus of the research was exploration of theoretical models and explanations for the dark energy that is driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe today.  The goal is to develop an understanding of which models are internally consistent, most well motivated based on our understanding of fundamental physics, and which are compatible with current cosmological data.  Such understanding can be useful for guiding future cosmological observations, and could lead to the discovery of new features of dark energy.\n\n \n\nThe grant contributed to the publication of over twenty scientific articles and three PhD theses, and to the training of four postdoctoral researchers and four graduate students.
