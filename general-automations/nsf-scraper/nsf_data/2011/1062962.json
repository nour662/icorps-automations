 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding establishes a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Connecticut focused on computer systems security research. Students will participate in research projects that should advance computer security and trustable computing hardware research. Specific activities include collaborative projects in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and Computer Science and Engineering Department, including research in hardware support for computer security, hardware Trojan detection, and IC authentication.   A series of training seminars will equip students with knowledge specific to the various research projects as well as general skills required in graduate school. In addition, participants will have the opportunity to participate in the Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust Symposium. This will broaden students' vision by allowing them to witness research projects conducted worldwide. This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The intellectual merit of this project lies with the strong research team and the focus on computer systems security, an area of national need and of interest to students. The students will participate in research initiatives that investigate algorithmic techniques, hardware and software design principles, computer architecture, and other aspects of trustable computing systems. A major goal of this project is to introduce such interdisciplinary research work to students in the early stages of their academic careers to spark their interests. At the same time, the research has the potential to contribute to the research core of the computing disciplines.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This project is aimed at preparing undergraduate students for graduate study in a research area of vital national interest. Computer systems are integrated into every part of our national infrastructure - including financial systems, communication systems, transportation, and defense. A primary national need is research and researchers who can address the security of these systems. The research opportunities that this proposal provides will help develop the next generation of researchers investigating these important computer security issues.",
