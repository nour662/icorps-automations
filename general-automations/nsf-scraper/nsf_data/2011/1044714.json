 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project \"TUES: Integration of Research and Undergraduate Education: Local Genome Diversity Studies in Puerto Rico\" incorporates a research project begun by faculty into the curriculum of the Biology major.  Because of several waves of immigration and colonization, the present day population of the island shows genetic markers derived from African, European, and Native American sources.  By systematically surveying the population in local regions for frequency of characteristic variants and mapping those onto the geography, it may be possible to find genetic evidence that supports the historical record.  This application of modern genetic concepts, techniques and analysis makes a rather abstract study concrete to the students involved.  The information developed might be used in the future to identify risk factors for diseases, a direct positive outcome of the research in addition to the education of the students.  Through careful instruction and mentoring, students go from the classroom into the field and then into the laboratory to accomplish this project.  They also progressively assume increased individual responsibility for their contributions to the overall project.  This project also has impacts beyond the accomplishment of the research objective and education of the students.  The student body at University of Puerto Rico at  Mayaguez is 97% Hispanic, a population underrepresented in the sciences.  Their retention in science majors should increase the diversity of the scientifically literate population.  Moreover, the project's design is amenable to adaptation in other areas where genetic mixing has occurred over historical time.  Students are prepared to communicate scientific results by reaching out to local high schools with the story of their research, thereby attracting more students to continue on to college and possibly study science.",
