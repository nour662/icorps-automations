 "awd_abstract_narration": "The encapsulation of an atom or an atomic cluster, or even a smaller fullerene in a fullerene cage offers a unique natural laboratory in which to examine the behavior of the guest system in confinement. Studies of these endofullerenes can not only lead to intriguing effects at the atomic scale but also can probe subtleties of quantum effects in the nanometer region. The endo-fullerenes also hold the promise of exciting applications in areas including, quantum computations, superconductivity, biomedical fields, drug delivery research, magnetic resonance imaging, and organic photovoltaic devices.  Further, the discovery of endo-fullerenes in extraterrestrial environments indicates their astrophysical relevance. Hence, understanding the influence of the confining cage on the spectroscopy of the confined species and vice versa, are matters of great scientific interest. \r\n\r\nA theoretical study of the response of these compounds to the external electromagnetic and charged particle fields will be performed in the current research. By employing this, the roles of (i) the collectivized plasmonic motion of electrons, (ii) the dopant-fullerene hybridization, and (iii) the oscillations due to multipath interferences between electrons liberated from various sites of the compound will be investigated. Spectroscopy of fullerenes and endo-fullerenes by fast, bare ion impact will also be considered to determine in detail the effects of dipole and non-dipole collective motions, and the interference between various multipole channels. Furthermore, calculations of the electron capture by positron impact on fullerenes and endo-fullerenes, forming positroniums, will be undertaken.",
