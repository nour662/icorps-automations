 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Coordination Network grant brings together and international, multi-disciplinary team of scientists and educators to better mobilize cases of long term human ecodynamics on the century to millennial scale to aid national and global efforts to develop effective future sustainable development and to create resources for Education for Sustainable Development (ESD).  This RCN project will develop a collaborative research network that will identify conditions that allow people to develop sustainable relationships with the environment over the millennial scale or have led to unsustainable outcomes. This proposal draws upon widespread recognition that inter-generational sustainability education efforts and formulation of long-term environmental policy for adaptive management are ill served by short observational spans, restricted case pools, and disciplinary stove-piping. This RCN will promote development of a transdisciplinary millennial scale perspective for a genuinely sustainable future through three interlinked working teams; 1) building capacity in long-term sustainability investigations through systematic inter-regional comparison of cases representing long-term human ecodynamics ?experiments? of coupled natural and human systems impacted by climate change, multi-generational human impact, and inter-regional connection; 2) building cyberinfrastructure support through common data management, digital dissemination and visualization tools that both aid sustainability researchers and connect with sustainability educators; 3) Enhancing local and national initiatives in sustainability education and community involvement in global change science by innovative application of digital technology and creating direct links with education professionals and involving active  local community participation in sustainability science & education.",
