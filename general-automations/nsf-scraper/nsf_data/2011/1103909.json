MRI is one of many applications of interest.  Quantization leads to new theoretical challenges in compressed sensing which are epitomized by the extreme case of 1-bit quantization; in this case only the sign of each measurement is kept.  The 1-bit compressed sensign model was introduced by Boufounas and Baraniuk in 2008.  It has practical applications because 1-bit measurements are robust to non-linear errors and can be implemented using simple hardware for analogue-to-digital conversion.  It also leads to beautiful mathematical questions stemming from the start geometric different between 1-bit measurements and linear measurements.  Further, the discrete nature of the measurements connects this signal processing problem to problems in data embedding, and the binary nature connects to binary statistical models.\n\nIn a string of several papers, my co-authors and I introduced two new convex programs designed for 1-bit compressed sensing  We analyzed the solution to these programs and thereby produced the first theoretical accuracy guaranteed for 1-bit compressed sensing with polynomial-time solvers.
