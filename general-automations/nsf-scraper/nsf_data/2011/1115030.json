 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lichens and bryophytes share biological traits that make them some of the most sensitive indicators of environmental change. The goal of this project is to provide high quality data to address how species distributions change as a result of major environmental events across time and space. Specifically, this project will digitize the label information (the what, when, where and by whom collected) and images for approximately 2.3 million biological specimens curated in North American lichen and bryophyte herbaria. These collections represent well over 90% of all specimens collected in Canada, the United States and Mexico and held by over 60 US non-governmental institutions. New, on-line digitization techniques will be made publically available at at http://symbiota.org/nalichens/ and http://symbiota.org/bryophytes/, and will allow interested members of the public to be involved and learn about biodiversity alongside the professionals.\r\n\r\nAvailability of nearly the entire North American bryophyte and lichen collections on-line will greatly accelerate knowledge and evaluation of the biodiversity of these organisms by fostering collaborations between professionals and the general public. Additionally, models developed from these digitized data will aid future mapping projections of large scale species distributions and identification of biodiversity hotspots as prime candidates for protection. These endeavors will help to elucidate regions where changes are imminent and likely to have substantial impact, as well as to facilitate proactive initiatives to alleviate such changes. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource.",

To do so, we created a set of workflows that allowed technicians to image labels of the specimens, upload those images directly to the Symbiota-based portals (Consortium of North American Lichen Herbaria and Consortium of North American Bryophyte Herbaria), and to transcribe these images with live updating. In total we generated approximately 44K labels of lichen specimens and 86K labels of bryophyte specimens, which were uploaded with existing images to the respective portals. These efforts have led to great improvements in our understanding of the contents of the MICH herbarium. We currently have at least 44.7K and 127.8K completely databased records of lichens and bryophytes, respectively, and these are all barcoded with label images that can accessed by the public. We also began the effort of georeferencing the specimens, which allows exact latitude and longitude to be attributed to specimens for use in analysis and depiction of the data, such as producing range maps. Moreover, these data can be used to understand continental-wide trends in distribution of species over time, which are known to be sensitive to environmental pollution and changing climate. Finally, the project trained and supported over 27 students and technicians in best herbarium practices, giving them hands-on experience working with collections and their digital derivatives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/22/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Timothy&nbsp;James</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1115030/1115030_10104185_1503417032403_DSC03705--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1115030/1115030_10104185_1503417032403_DSC03705--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student imaging technician preparing lichen specimen for imaging.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1115030/1115030_10104185_1503417032403_DSC03705--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student imaging technician preparing lichen specimen for imaging.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Depicted is the standard set up for photographing specimen labels.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TY James</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;James</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student imaging technician preparing lichen specimen for imaging.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
