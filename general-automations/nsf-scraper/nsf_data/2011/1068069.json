 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanics and magneto-mechanics of magnetic shape-memory alloys at the nanoscale, and to explore the potential and limitations of magnetic shape-memory alloys in small-scale devices. Four objectives include: (i) Mechanics and magneto-mechanics of nano-columns; (ii) Structure, phase transformation, and mechanics of thin films; (iii) Fabrication and magneto-mechanics of nanodiscs and nanowires; (iv) Interaction of magnetic domains and crystallographic twins on the nano-scale. The combined study of nanofabrication, processing and thermo-magneto-nanomechanical characterization will link microstructural features to unique properties spawned by their reduced size. Nanofabrication and processing techniques will include physical vapor deposition of films on various substrates, electron-beam lithography, focused-ion-beam machining and thermo-magneto-mechanical training. The microstructure and magnetic domain structure will be characterized with various scanning probe techniques and transmission electron microscopy techniques. \r\n\r\nCurrent device, logical and memory technology is based on binary mono-functional elements and volatile device states. The multi-state, multifunctional and non-volatile magnetic shape-memory alloy nanostructures bear a high potential to open new pathways for small-scale devices and memory applications. Students employed through this project will engage in an international effort, which includes visits at partner institutions in Austria and Spain. Following a successful tradition at Boise State University, several undergraduate students will be included in research efforts. They will present results at international conferences and author peer-reviewed journal articles. Outreach activities are targeted towards grade schools to attract children to careers in science and technology and include regular visits of grade school classrooms.",
