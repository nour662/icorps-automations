 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research on Carbon, Water, and Energy Balance of the Arctic Landscape\r\nat Flagship Observatories in Alaska and Siberia\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe arctic landscape interacts with the global and regional climate by exchanging carbon dioxide, methane, water, and energy with the atmosphere.  Understanding how these exchanges are regulated and how they change is a key goal of the US Study of Environmental Arctic Change and the NSF Arctic Observatory Network.  The first goal of this work is year round monitoring of carbon, water, and energy balance at two arctic sites, Imnavait Creek in Alaska and Cherskii in Siberia.  The work will be a collaboration among researchers from the Marine Biological Laboratory, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Northeast Science Station, Russia, and the University of Michigan.  The second goal is the development of these two sites as  ?Flagship? observatories for research on arctic lands and freshwaters.  The main task here is to integrate the new carbon, water, and energy balance data with the already large, diverse, and growing data bases from other research done at these sites.  A third aim is to promote PanArctic comparisons and development of PanArctic data bases.\r\n  \r\n\tBroader impacts include contributions to education, including underrepresented groups, through participation in the Logan Science Journalism program, the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research Schoolyard program, and outreach to Native Alaskan communities.  Research and education infrastructure will be enhanced by making the data bases available online.  Benefits to society include improved understanding of the impacts of climate change, especially in Alaska where the local residents are closely tied to the land through traditional, subsistence lifestyles.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit:  Carbon balance, water balance, and the land-surface energy balance are key components of the Arctic System, at all scales from a single leaf to the entire Arctic.  Understanding of how these balances are regulated and how they change is a key goal of the NSF Arctic Observatory Network (AON) program.  Carbon, water, and energy also interact strongly with each other, and development of the necessary understanding requires that they be studied together rather than separately.   Thus, the core research need that drives this Arctic Observatory Network (AON) proposal is the acquisition of high-quality, long-term, multivariable, time series data sets that increase our ability to understand interactions among carbon, water, and energy fluxes in arctic landscapes and that optimize our ability to translate this understanding into predictions of change at the scale of landscapes, watersheds, the entire Arctic System, and ultimately feedbacks to global climate.  \n\nAs the lead institution in this three-institution collaborative project involving the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the University of Michigan, the first goal of the MBL researchers was to curate these data sets and to make them available to researchers elsewhere.  This goal was accomplished by archiving the final data sets in the Arctic LTER project data base and by providing a link to the US LTER Network Information System and to major data services including AmeriFlux, FluxNet, and the National Snow and Ice Data Center.  These data sets are all searchable, sortable, and remotely downloadable by any interested parties.  All of the data as well as more recently-collected data (not yet quality-checked) are also stored on the project web site at University of Alaska.\n\nThe second goal of the project, to build a \"Flagship\" arctic data base for the intensively studied area near Toolik Lake, has been met by linking the data collected by this project with the extensive data collected by the Arctic LTER project---all of these data sets are archived using the same metadata and other protocols and linked to the LTER Network Information system as well as to the Toolik Field Station Environmental Data Center.\n\nThe third goal of the project, to promote PanArctic comparisons and development of PanArctic data bases, has been met by working with international colleagues in a series of PanArctic syntheses leading to publications and data bases.  The principal colleagues in this effort have included the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX), the Zackenberg Ecological Research Operations (ZERO) group based in Denmark, the US-based (and NSF-supported) Permafrost Carbon Network, and other long-term collaborators mainly in the UK. \n\nBroader Impacts: This research developed data bases and models to determine effects of climate change on the ecosystem services of Alaska?s North Slope and of the Arctic System.  These data and models can be used to inform future management decisions by predicting the impact of future changes in climate and feedbacks from the Arctic to the globe.  All data collected during the project are readily available to scientists and to the public via the LTER Network Information System and the Arctic LTER data base. Funds from this project were used to train several postdoctoral and undergraduate researchers and included contributions to teaching and learning through outreach programs in collaboration with the Arctic Long Term Ecological Research (ARC LTER) project based at Toolik Lake, Alaska, and the Marine Biological Laboratory.  Lastly, this project revealed linkages and dependencies due to the effects of climate on biogeochemical processes that are relevant not only to the global human population as related to climate change, but also to the local Native American population, who depend on the North Slope landscape to sustain their subsistence lifestyles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gaius R Shaver"
