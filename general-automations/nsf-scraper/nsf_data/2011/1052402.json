 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protein synthesis is one of the most critical cellular activities of any organism.  Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are essential enzymes in protein biosynthesis, catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to tRNA adaptors for ribosomal decoding of genetic information.  Many tRNA synthetases have additional roles in cellular regulation separate from their function in translation.  This project investigates mechanistic features of methionyl-tRNA synthetase, which is a distinctive tRNA synthetase in that its tRNA isoacceptors have divergent fates in translational initiation versus elongation. The tRNA synthetases exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms in different organisms, and, in some organisms, they contain appended protein domains that expand their cellular functions.  Using tools of molecular biology, computational chemistry, and mechanistic enzymology, this research seeks to expand understanding of evolutionarily distinct methionyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes in protein biosynthesis and novel cellular activities. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  The project provides training in modern biological chemistry techniques to emerging scientists at Wake Forest University, a liberal arts university. The local community is impacted through after-school science clubs offering hands-on enrichment activities for at-risk middle school students.  These science clubs are led by undergraduate students in a seminar course on the history of women in science, thus providing a real-world example of the challenges inherent in increasing participation of populations typically underrepresented in science.",

This translation of information from the nucleic acid language to that of proteins (made of amino acids) must be both rapid and accurate. A key component of translational accuracy is the family of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Our lab studies one member of this family, namely the protein methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS). MetRS is required for incorporation of methionine into proteins; methionine is the first amino acid in most proteins and is also present within the body of proteins. With funding from NSF, we have studied how MetRS recognizes (binds) its partner tRNA and communicates that binding event through the protein and tRNA to efficiently catalyze formation of the methionylated tRNA necessary for accurate translation of the genetic message. We have used computational approaches and mutagenesis experiments to evaluate the role that macromolecular flexibility plays in enzyme catalysis. We determined that changes to tRNA flexibility that seem significant computationally can be compensated for when the tRNA is bound by the MetRS enzyme. That is, the enzyme induces a catalytically active conformation even when there are mutations to the tRNA sequence. We have also made mutations to the enzyme and studied these both computationally and experimentally; depending on the location of the mutation, these are more detrimental to enzyme activity than are mutations to the tRNA.

Not only does the aminotransferase domain catalyze methionine formation, but the synthetase domain is able to use methionine for aminoacyl-tRNA production.
