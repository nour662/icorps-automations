Approximately 250 scientists and engineers from around the world are expected to attend\r\nthis symposium to present the latest results on how local site conditions affect ground motion\r\ninduced by earthquakes. Since the 3rd Symposium in Grenoble in 2006, there have been\r\nsignificant earthquakes in Japan, China, Italy, Haiti, Chile, Mexico, and New Zealand that have\r\nprovided a wealth of data. In particular, the 2010 Darfield event in New Zealand and the 2011\r\nTohoku event in Japan induced widespread liquefaction. Analysis of the data from these events\r\nand dissemination of the results to larger communities will aid in the mitigation of damaging\r\neffects from earthquakes in the future.\r\nThis conference will bring together an international community of earthquake scientists and\r\nengineers. It will promote an interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and provide everyone with a\r\nperspective on the current state-of-art research into the fundamental problems associated with\r\nquantifying the effects of the local site geology.\r\nThe papers presented at the conference will be published on a CD-ROM and distributed to all\r\nregistered participants. The papers will also be available through the conference website to the\r\ngeneral public.",
