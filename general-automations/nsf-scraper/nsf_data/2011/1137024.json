 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports Sassan Sheikholeslami of Stanford University as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.  Dr. Sheikholeslami will work on synthesizing new kinds of materials with unusual physical properties (e.g. materials with negative refractive index) using a bottom-up approach.  Materials will be synthesized using self-assembly of metal nanoparticles with a DNA scaffolding.  The PI will collaborate with scientists at the Molecular Foundry of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  The ultimate goal of this research is to develop efficient, inexpensive methods for making interesting 'metamaterials'.  For his plan for broadening participation, Dr. Sheikholeslami will collaborate with a San Francisco Bay Area artist to develop an exhibition on nanoscience to help educate the public about this important area of technology. \r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. Sheikholeslami is aimed at developing new materials with interesting and unusual properties.  The specific materials that Dr. Sheikholeslami is concentrating on ('metamaterials') have remarkable optical properties, unlike any other common optical materials.  Similar materials have been created in the laboratory with elaborate and expensive lithographic methods.  Dr. Sheikholeslami is developing methods that will create these materials in a flask, at a much lower cost.  Work like this enables scientists to develop materials that may lead to revolutionary technology that can have impacts in optics, solar energy, and defense.   The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Sheikholeslami are aimed at giving a broad cross section of the public exposure to an important area of the chemical sciences.",
