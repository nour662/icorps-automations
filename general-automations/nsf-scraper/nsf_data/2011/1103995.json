The project is (1) creating bio-energy certificate and associate degree education programs to serve at least 40 traditional and non-traditional students recruited through a marketing and recruitment plan, (2) developing alternative educational and career pathways for students from high school to technical college to university, (3) offering professional development about bio-energy to 120 high school and college teachers, and (4) disseminating project findings and resources throughout Ohio and the nation. The project will address Ohio's growing need for bio-energy technicians.",
