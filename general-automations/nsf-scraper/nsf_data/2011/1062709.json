The principal investigator and two graduate students who are program alumni will supervise the work. The program has a three decade history of attracting extraordinary students and has produced over 160 papers in well regarded professional research journals.\r\n\r\nOverall 90% of the Duluth REU participants pursue a Ph.D. degree with 70% attending graduate school at a top institution.  The most important impact of the Duluth program is the training of future generations of mathematicians who will foster undergraduate research when they become professionals. The Duluth program has served as a model and an inspiration for many other undergraduate research programs.\r\n\r\nProgram Web URL: www.d.umn.edu/~jgallian/REU.html\r\n\r\nThe site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
