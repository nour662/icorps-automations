 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year REU Site program at Auburn University is interdisciplinary in nature and has a strong focus on micro and nano-material science and technology. Specific topics will include materials synthesis and characterization, micro/nano particle formation processes, nanomechanics of thin films, carbon-nanotubes, inorganic nano-rods, MEMS, nanoparticulate systems and micro films for drug delivery, nanofibers yarns and fabrics, nanoparticle thin films, and others. The program involves fourteen faculty mentors from diverse academic departments, including Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Polymer and Fiber Engineering, Pharmacy, and Biosystems Engineering.\r\n\r\nREU participants will be paired with research faculty mentors to work in their laboratories on projects focused on micro/nano-structured materials, therapeutics, and devices. Students will be introduced to skills such as literature searching and review, research design, laboratory research techniques, written and oral presentation, as well as working in a team environment. Students will participate as a group in weekly seminars and workshops that allow cross cultivation of the individual research experience as well as address professional development (e.g., research methods, transferring to a bachelor degree program, steps in the graduate school application process, technical writing, effective presentation skills, professional etiquette training, ethics in science and engineering, patents and commercialization, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed project include: 1)providing an interdisciplinary research environment to a diverse group of undergraduate participants from Alabama and Gulf State four-year institutions and community colleges with limited opportunity to engage in research activities; 2)increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities in research;3)encouraging community college students and siblings to pursue bachelor degrees in science and technology areas;4)encouraging students and siblings at undergraduate institutions to pursue graduate studies;5)enhancing professional development and career guidance;6)fostering undergraduate research opportunities throughout Auburn University; and 7)promoting faculty development through the undergraduate research mentoring experience.",
