 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Oceanography Society will publish a special issue of the Journal \"Oceanography\" on the topic of sea level. Understanding the causes and consequences of sea level rise, and ultimately predicting its timing and magnitude, as global temperatures increase is one of the most pressing scientific problems of the day, with considerable socioeconomic impacts for those who live in coastal and low-lying areas. The special issue of will include articles written by scientists who use different techniques in their research: scientific ocean drilling cores; satellite measurements; ocean observations from floats, drifters, and moored arrays; and modeling, among others. The publication of the special issue will be jointly supported by NSF and NOAA, NSF's share of 25K is 50% of the total cost.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nIn spite of its importance predicting future rise remains one of the great challenges for climate science. To truly predict sea level rise a vigorous and interdisciplinary research effort, including learning about sea level fluctuations through Earth?s history is needed. The special issue of will bring together authors from numerous disciplines to explore all of these aspects of sea level rise, from the 100 m plus rises and falls of the past ice age, to modern-day sea level rise and beyond. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nArticles will be written for a broad, scientifically literate audience so that cross-disciplinary discussions are facilitated and science is also transmitted in a readable and professional way to managers and decision-makers. Articles will be written by top researchers in their fields and include references cited, and are peer reviewed. All articles are published online as free access (no password required to retrieve an article).",
