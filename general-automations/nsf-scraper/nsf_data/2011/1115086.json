 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lichens and bryophytes share biological traits that make them some of the most sensitive indicators of environmental change. The goal of this project is to provide high quality data to address how species distributions change as a result of major environmental events across time and space. Specifically, this project will digitize the label information (the what, when, where and by whom collected) and images for approximately 2.3 million biological specimens curated in North American lichen and bryophyte herbaria. These collections represent well over 90% of all specimens collected in Canada, the United States and Mexico and held by over 60 US non-governmental institutions. New, on-line digitization techniques will be made publically available at at http://symbiota.org/nalichens/ and http://symbiota.org/bryophytes/, and will allow interested members of the public to be involved and learn about biodiversity alongside the professionals.\r\n\r\nAvailability of nearly the entire North American bryophyte and lichen collections on-line will greatly accelerate knowledge and evaluation of the biodiversity of these organisms by fostering collaborations between professionals and the general public. Additionally, models developed from these digitized data will aid future mapping projections of large scale species distributions and identification of biodiversity hotspots as prime candidates for protection. These endeavors will help to elucidate regions where changes are imminent and likely to have substantial impact, as well as to facilitate proactive initiatives to alleviate such changes. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThrough this project, The New York Botanical Garden digitized 89,196 specimens of bryophytes and 69,478 specimens of lichens, and contributed 321,943 digitized specimen records that were digitized previously.  The 562,786 specimens of bryophytes and lichens that have been contributed by The New York Botanical Garden this year represent a significant contribution to the overall project in terms of the number of specimens that are now available digitally through the Lichen and Bryophyte portals.  An anticipated additional 75,000 digitized records of newly acquired lichen specimens will be added to the portal as a result of other funded projects.  Specimens from other institutions were also digitized by The New York Botanical Garden:  Cornell University (5877 specimens), Rutgers University 9505 specimens), University of Arizona (3738), University of Connecticut (9373), University of New Hampshire (1607) and  University of Vermont (22,069).  We upload all images to the project ftp site; and participate in group effort to digitize exsiccate collectively. \n\nBecause of the great sensitivity of bryophytes and lichens to environmental change, the specimens digitized in the course of this project, which span a wide range of taxonomic groups as well as a wide geographic and chronological span, can be incorporated into environmental models that will help predict vegetation change due to climate change; these data can help make well-informed decisions about areas for conservation, and for monitoring heavy metal and other atmospheric pollutants.  Research on bryophytes and lichens has been greatly enhanced already through the digitization of these specimens, and evidenced by the increased number of requests for information we have received for NYBG specimens that have been digitized through this project.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis project has served as an excellent training opportunity for young scientists who did not receive any formal training in their undergraduate studies in biodiversity documentation.  These students learn the fundamentals of collection management, learn the basic biology of bryophytes and lichens, and learned digitization techniques, including data capture and archiving.  One postdoctoral fellow and six postgraduate interns were trained in herbarium management practices, specimen digitization and image quality control, and project management.  One of the postgraduate interns is now a pursuing graduate studies in lichenology, and three of the other interns now lead digitization projects at The New York Botanical Garden.\n\nTwo training videos for the project were produced by interns were employed by New York Botanical Garden on this project.  These videos provided the only source of training in digitization techniques for the project.  The New York Botanical Garden participates in ongoing formal and informal training for visitors (students as well as colleagues from other natural history collections).  As part of this training, we give demonstrations of the techniques, equipment and workflow used in this project.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/16/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William R Buck"
