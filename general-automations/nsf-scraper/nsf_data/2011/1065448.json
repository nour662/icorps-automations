 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advent of new microprocessor chip architectures (e.g.,  GPUs, multi-core/many-core chips architectures), next generation large scale integrated problems such as datacenter applications points to the need for a comprehensive rethinking of the approach to architecture design, programming, and software design.  The research proposed in this document will be concerned with the characteristic behavior of future applications, highlighted by the performance, scalability, and how computer systems (execution and architecture models, and compilers/runtime software technologies) can be appropriately targeted.  This work will result in the characterization of the features and requirements of such applications, in the development of suitable execution and architecture models that match their needs, and in the development of a compilation technology and its associated tools that will work in coordination with the proposed architecture models for the targeted application domains.  The outcome of the proposed research will be an in-depth understanding of the needs of future applications, the demonstration of new architecture ideas, as well as the design of compilation methods and tools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMost commodity microprocessors are now based on the \"multi-core\" model.  This means that any performance improvement can be obtained by some sort of parallel execution.   In the recent past, this has meant overlapping individual jobs of an Operating System (e.g., different apps of a Windows-based machine).  While this is useful in terms of overall performance, it does not increase the performance of any individual job.  In this research, we have thus strived to provide tools that will provide improved programmability of parallel applications.  We have also designed new approaches for the performance evaluation of such hardware/ software environments.  \n\nAt the same time, we have sought to provide some guidelines to processor designers as to what would constitute an optimal combination of features.  Indeed, existing architectures are based on a \"homogeneous\" model, meaning that the multiple cores are identical.  We have determined that a \"heterogeneous\" strategy would be applicable to a wider range of cases.  This means that cores of different types should be integrated in the same chip, including for example, FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), GPUs, etc. to better adapt to new applications.\n\nOur results have been published our in major scientific venues (conferences and journals) for dissemination.  The outcomes have also been explained and articulated by the PIs through a number of keynotes, invited talks, panel presentations to a broader international community of researchers and practitioners of interests. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Guang R Gao"
