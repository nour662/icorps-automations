 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site brings eight undergraduate students to Rutgers each\r\nsummer for a ten-week research internship in the area of perceptual\r\nscience and technology.  This research area centers on the challenges\r\nand opportunities of building novel computational models that systems\r\nmay use to understand their environment and act intelligently in it.\r\nThe area affords a range of research methods, including designing\r\nalgorithms, building systems, gathering and analyzing data, and\r\nunderstanding intelligence in its human context.  Research projects\r\ncover topics such as: computational approaches to the perception and\r\nrecognition of objects, faces, scenes, depth and motion; perceptual\r\ncategorization and perceptual decisions; data mining and statistical\r\nanalysis of perceptual input; search, attention, and visuo-motor\r\nlearning; visual experiences in human-computer interaction; and\r\ncomputational depiction and design.  The site strives to recruit and\r\nsupport interns from underrepresented populations and to foster\r\ncollaborative research.  Accepted students work closely with a faculty\r\nmentor from drafting a project plan through carrying out and\r\npresenting their research.  Each project includes a pathway for two or\r\nmore interns to bring different results, data, or methods to bear on a\r\nshared problem.  The site holds workshops on research practice,\r\nresearch ethics, skills for collaboration, and careers in perceptual\r\nscience and technology.  Social events reinforce the sense of\r\ncommunity.  The integrative, collaborative focus of the site offers\r\ninterns a deeper sense of range of the different careers, topics and\r\nwork environments available to them, and allows them to fine-tune a\r\nmatch between their research plans and their personal goals,\r\nbackgrounds, and interests. \r\n\r\nThe site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program",
