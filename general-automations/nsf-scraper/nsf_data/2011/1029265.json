 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current prediction skill for the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is limited, and particularly poor for the initiation phase over the Indian Ocean.  The inability of state-of-the-art global models to reproduce the MJO degrades their seasonal to inter-annual prediction and lessens confidence in their ability to project future climate. The overarching goal of DYNAMO is to expedite our understanding of processes key to MJO initiation over the Indian Ocean and to help improve simulation and prediction of the MJO.\r\n\r\nThe DYNAMO field campaign is proposed as the US component of CINDY2011 (Cooperative Indian Ocean Experiment on Intraseasonal Variability in 2011), an international field program planned for October 2011 - March 2012 in the equatorial central Indian Ocean region. Four countries (Australia, India, Japan, and the US) will participate. This field program is designed to observe the structure and evolution of cloud populations, their interaction with the large-scale environment, and air-sea interaction processes during MJO initiation.  An array of three upper-ocean / surface-flux moorings (DYNAMO moorings) will be used to study oceanic processes in the surface mixed layer and the stratified thermocline in the equatorial Indian Ocean and their effects on the initiation and evolution of MJO.  The scientific goals are to quantify and understand the dynamics of the preconditioning, evolution, and recovery of the upper ocean as it interacts with MJO events and, thereby, to provide accurate physics to parameterization schemes in numerical models of the MJO. Key upper oceanic processes crucial to the coupling with the MJO include: (1) turbulence heat flux at the base of the surface mixed layer, (2) barrier layer, (3) Wyrtki jet, (4) shallow Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge, and (5) diurnal variation of surface forcing, mixed layer processes, and turbulence flux. Testable hypotheses for effects of these oceanic processes are identified and will be tackled using 3.5-month continuous observations of the upper ocean processes and turbulence flux across the equatorial Indian Ocean. The mooring array will be deployed in the center of a radar sounding array consisting of two ships and two island stations, representing the core observational components of the DYNAMO/CINDY2011 program. Each mooring will be equipped with meteorological sensors, arrays of CTD sensors, moored microstructure sensors (pods), and ADCPs. Additional arrays of pods will be deployed on three nearby RAMA moorings. Combined with measurements from other atmospheric and oceanic components of DYNAMO, we will develop a detailed reconstruction of the response (recovery) of the surface mixed layer, barrier layer, shallow Seychelles-Chagos thermocline ridge, Wyrtki jet, and equatorial turbulent flux to (from) the MJO.\r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit:  DYNAMO moorings will provide observations of the ocean barrier layer, upper-ocean mixing and entrainment, air-sea interaction, and overall surface mixed layer processes in the Indian Ocean which are key to the MJO initiation. These observations will be available to modelers, theoreticians, and other observational groups to better understand and predict the tropical climate system. The observations will provide physical insight into the interaction of oceanic processes with the MJO and lead to physics-based parameterizations that will improve MJO prediction skill.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The project will introduce young scientists to complex multi-scale and air-sea interaction problems in the tropical climate system. DYNAMO observations will be used to calibrate and validate satellite retrievals, benefiting their application to much broader areas beyond MJO-related problems. Improved MJO simulation and prediction born from DYNAMO activities will enhance the capacity to deliver prediction and assessment products on intra-seasonal timescales for societal risk management and decision making, and to strengthen confidence in climate simulation and projection.",

Working with R.-C. Lien from the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington, our goals were to quantify and understand the dynamics of the preconditioning, evolution, and recovery of the upper ocean as it interacts with MJO events. The mooring array was deployed along 78E in the center of a radar sounding array consisting of two ships and two island stations, representing core observational components of the larger DYNAMO program. Each mooring was equipped with meteorological sensors, arrays of CTD sensors, moored microstructure sensors (cpods), and profiling current meters. Additional arrays of cpods were deployed on RAMA moorings at 0, 80E and 0, 90E.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">An unexpected outcome of the complementary shipboard experiment (1059055) was the fish aggregations beneath the ship that contaminated Doppler sonar measurements of ocean currents and generated high turbulence levels via active swimming. This was diagnosed by the analysis of Pujiana etal (2015) using independent measurements from high-frequency shipboard echosounder and, importantly, from the moored cpods at the 0, 80E mooring 1 km away from the ship. Day/night discrepancies in e at the ship (Revelle) in the deep, marginally stable flow beneath the surface mixed layer were not replicated at the mooring (Figure 1). It was determined that fish, following the upwards nighttime migration of zooplankton into the near-surface waters illuminated by the ship&rsquo;s lights and actively swimming against the mean current, generated this contamination. This did not happen at the mooring in the absence of nighttime lighting.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Consequently, we learned a lesson in ichthyogenic turbulence (Pujiana etal, 2015), finding the principal characteristics to be (i) low wave number roll-off of shear spectra in the inertial subrange relative to geophysical turbulence, (ii) Thorpe overturning scales that are small compared with the Ozmidov scale, and (iii) low mixing efficiency. These factors extend previous findings from very different biophysical regimes and support the general conclusion that the biological contribution to mixing the ocean via turbulence is negligible.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Perhaps most significantly, these new moored measurements of the ocean&rsquo;s response to the intense surface winds and cooling by two successive MJO pulses showed persistent ocean currents and subsurface mixing after pulse passage, thereby reducing ocean heat energy available for later pulses by an amount significantly greater than via atmospheric surface cooling alone (Figure 2). This suggested that thermal mixing in the upper ocean from a particular pulse might affect the amplitude of the following pulse. We tested this hypothesis by comparing 18 pulse pairs, each separated by &lt; 55 days, measured over a 33-year period (Figure 3). With this comparison, we found a significant tendency for weak (strong) pulses, associated with low (high) cooling rates, to be followed by stronger (weaker) pulses. We therefore proposed that the ocean introduces a memory effect into the MJO whereby each event is governed in part by the previous event (Moum etal, 2016).</p>\n<p class=\"SOMContent\">The correlation shown in Figure 3 is consistent with a broader potential association of high <em>SST </em>and high <sup>3</sup>RMM (where <sup>3</sup>RMM is a measure of MJO intensity; Figure 4). The occurrence and intensity of tropical cyclones (TCs, including hurricanes and typhoons) is dynamically associated with warm <em>SST</em> through its effect on the moisture content of the atmospheric boundary layer. However, showing this statistically (important for projecting occurrence frequencies and intensities in a changing climate) has not been straightforward. Tropical <em>SST</em> has been shown to be correlated with the maximum cubed surface wind speed within hurricanes, a direct measure of the power in individual TCs. A strong relationship also exists between the frequency of TCs with <em>SST</em>, however indirect the <em>SST</em> / TC number relationship. These studies benefited from relatively long records (&gt; 80 years) and direct measurements of cyclone winds and occurrences.</p>\n<p class=\"SOMContent\">By comparison, our record of <sup>3</sup>RMM is short and measurements are less direct. However, a relatively unsophisticated analysis using <sup>3</sup>RMM of the 84 MJO pulses identified in our record compared to <em>SST</em> averaged locally at 0<strong>&deg;</strong>, 80<strong>&deg;</strong>E is suggestive. We sorted the 84 pulses into three ranges of pre-existing <em>SST</em> and then counted the number of pulses in six ranges of <sup>3</sup>RMM (Figure 4). This shows a progressively greater propensity for large values of <sup>3</sup>RMM to occur with progressively larger <em>SST.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/11/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;N&nbsp;Moum</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1029265/1029265_10061859_1484153714074_fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1029265/1029265_10061859_1484153714074_fig4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1029265/1029265_10061859_1484153714074_fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Negative feedback</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Moum etal 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;N&nbsp;Moum</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1029265/1029265_10061859_1484153610315_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1029265/1029265_10061859_1484153610315_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1029265/1029265_10061859_1484153610315_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">- Probability density functions of ? from the Chameleon microstructure turbulence profiler (solid curves denoted as Revelle) measured at depths of 55?64 m and from a moored ?pod (dashed curves denoted as RAMA) at 59 m during daytime (orange) and nighttime (black) over 21?24 November 2011.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Pujiana etal 2015</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;N&nbsp;Moum</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1029265/1029265_10061859_1484153665581_fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1029265/1029265_10061859_1484153665581_fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1029265/1029265_10061859_1484153665581_fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ocean response to successive Madden-Julian Oscillation pulses</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Moum metal 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;N&nbsp;Moum</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1029265/1029265_10061859_1484153813681_fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1029265/1029265_10061859_1484153813681_fig5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1029265/1029265_10061859_1484153813681_fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Stronger MJO pulses are generally associated with higher pre-pulse SST.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Moum etal 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;N&nbsp;Moum</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
