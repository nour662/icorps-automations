The funds will support a total of 15 researchers from the U.S. to attend the symposium. The conference will consist of three days of technical presentations, panel discussions, and keynote speeches, and a technical tour to RIKEN - The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Ohmori Materials Fabrication Laboratory. The focus of panel discussions will be on energy and sustainability in micromanufacturing, which requires global collaboration to address this challenging issue.\r\n\r\nThis grant will stimulate technical discussions among researchers in micromanufacturing and foster future collaborations. The benefits to the U.S. researchers attending the Conference will include knowledge gained from the technical presentations and discussions on various micro processes, systems and applications. Japan is one of the world leaders in micro-manipulation, micro-machining, and micro-forming, hence, the requested support will enable many researchers (faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students), scientists and engineers from the U.S. to gain firsthand knowledge of research, development, and implementation of micromanufacturing technologies in Japan.",
