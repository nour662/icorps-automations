 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physical and microbiological processes governing nitrous oxide and methane fluxes to and from soil are highly variable in space and time and are controlled, directly and indirectly, by soil moisture content, which is largely governed by hydrologic processes.  The goal of this project is to evaluate the impact of hydrological dynamics, in other words catchment scale water redistribution, on soil-atmosphere trace gas fluxes across a mountain landscape.  A combination of nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide flux determinations, soil water content and redistribution measurements, chemical assays of potential reactants, digital terrain analyses and hydrological monitoring will be used to assess the environmental controls on trace gas flux spatial and temporal dynamics in a forested Montana watershed.  Relationships between trace gas sources and sinks and hydrologic properties in montane ecosystems will be uncovered.  This project will test an existing topography analysis framework that uses hydrologic property based landscape units (slope position in relation to streams, aspect, drainage area, and so on) to translate point-scale trace gas measurements to the landscape scale. The project builds upon prior and ongoing NSF-funded research on hydrologic controls on carbon dioxide flux in montane ecosystems and uses existing field infrastructure and technical resources to advantage.\r\nNitrous oxide and methane are, like carbon dioxide, radiatively active trace gases that contribute significantly to global warming. It is known that the montane forested ecosystems of North America are a significant carbon sink.  However, the net impact of montane forested ecosystems on atmospheric warming potential is unclear because the net fluxes of other trace gases are not known. This is, in part, because effective approaches to translate point trace gas flux measurements to whole landscapes have yet to be developed for such systems. The approach that will be developed and tested in this project has the potential to improve net greenhouse gas emission estimates for montane forested ecosystems at the landscape scale ? the spatial scale considered in policymaking regarding greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, this research project will provide land-air carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane flux data at multiple space and time scales that will be useful to scientists interested in benchmarking models. Hands-on field training opportunities in hydrology and biogeochemistry will be provided for graduate and undergraduate students from Montana State University.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nMethane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), like carbon dioxide (CO2), are radiatively active trace gases that contribute significantly to global warming. The physical and microbiological processes governing their fluxes to and from terrestrial environments are highly variable in space and time, especially across complex terrain.  Soil-atmosphere trace gas fluxes can also be bidirectional, and are strongly influenced by soil moisture and oxygen and by the transport of chemical reactants; these controlling factors are largely governed by hydrologic processes.  Our project goal was to improve understanding of hydrologic influences (i.e., the seasonal redistribution of snowmelt and rainfall across a landscape) on soil-atmosphere trace gas fluxes.  We used a combination of CH4, N2O and CO2 flux determinations, soil water content and water table measurements, digital terrain analyses and hydrological modeling to assess the environmental controls on the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil trace gas fluxes across a mountainous forest watershed in Montana.  Our study built upon prior and ongoing research on carbon and water cycling and carbon dioxide flux controls, and took advantage of preexisting field infrastructure and technical resources at the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest (TCEF).  We integrated our research plan with a contemporaneous study of the distributions of soil microbes involved in producing and consuming CH4, providing additional insight into the observed patterns of trace gas fluxes at TCEF.\n\n \nForested mountain ecosystems of North America represent a significant carbon sink.  However, their net impact on atmospheric warming potential remains unclear, partly because effective tools for scaling point measurements of CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes to whole landscapes have yet to be developed.  We built on a hydrology and topography analysis framework to help bridge an existing knowledge gap between soil processes operating at the point and plot scale and their cumulative impact over complex landscapes &ndash; the spatial scale considered in policymaking regarding greenhouse gas emissions.  The study uncovered significant relationships between trace gas sources and sinks and the topographical measures that influence water redistribution  It also improved net greenhouse gas emission predictability, and provided a new perspective on forest management in a changing climate.  Moreover, this research provided benchmark data for models of CO2, CH4 and N2O land-air fluxes at multiple space and time scales, while providing both instructional and hands-on field training opportunities in hydrology and biogeochemistry for graduate and undergraduate students from Montana State University, Duke University and other institutions.  These are some of our key findings:\n\n \na) The upland watershed soils at TCEF constitute an atmospheric CH4 sink but with respect to N2O they are a small source to nearly neutral.  Riparian corridors tend to be sources of both N2O and CH4, but exhibit higher variability.\nb) Soil water content clearly exerts an important control on trace gas fluxes, and reversals of flux direction can and do occur in some locations with soil wet-up and dry-down.\nc) Soil gas diffusivities determined empirically using multiple trace gas flux and gradient measurements indicate gas-specific differences in diffusivity-soil moisture parameterizations that may be related to near-surface hot spots/moments of gas production.  Methane diffusivity behaved as standard models predicted but N2O diffusivity did not; hence, our confidence in scaling up CH4 fluxes to the landscape is much higher than that associated with N2O flux upscaling.\nd) Methane uptake by upland soils exhibits no apparent diel cycle, while CH4 emission from riparian soils exhibits only weak diel cycling; therefore, seasonally integrated flux data based on individual daily flux measurements are likely to be temporally unbiased.\ne) Soil microbial community structure and th..."
