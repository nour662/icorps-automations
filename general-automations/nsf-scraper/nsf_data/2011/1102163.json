 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to examine the integration of optical and fluidic networks into microchips, to sense and manipulate complex fluids for life science applications. The program will examine silicon-based label-free optofluidic chips with enhanced sensing resolution and manipulation capabilities. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is to create a transformative science base for wavelength-scale integrated optofluidics based on optical resonators, with collaborative efforts with GE Global Research Center. This technology can perform high spatial resolution sensing, while seeking to significantly improve the refractive index measurement sensitivity. Approaches will be pursued for reduced noise and increased specificity. The second thread of this work will advance concepts such as optofluidic multiplexers and demultiplexers in the toolbox of microfluidic chips. Optical waveguide arrays with switchable laser excitation will be examined. A fundamental advantage of our technology over conventional free-space optical trapping is that the resolution can be sub-diffraction with the subwavelength photonic devices. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are the development of high-sensitivity universal integrated optical sensors that will enhance Lab-on-a-Chip functionalities. The proposed silicon-based optofluidic integration is scalable to large arrays for high throughput analysis, and can be manufactured within the vast silicon infrastructure. The proposed optofluidic chips can significantly increase the processing power of microfluidic chips, for industrial applications such as label-free biomolecule sensing, manipulation, and active control. The educational components of this interdisciplinary research include joint PhD student advising, undergraduate internships at GE, outreach to high-school teachers, and a joint annual industrial-university colloquium.",
