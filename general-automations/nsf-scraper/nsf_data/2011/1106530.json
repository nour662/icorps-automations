 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on the study of geometric, analytic and \r\ninformation-theoretic aspects of high dimensional phenomena\r\non the border of probability, convex geometry and analysis. \r\nOne part of the project concerns the problem of rates of\r\nconvergence in the entropic central limit theorem, and is devoted \r\nto obtaining new asymptotic expansions for the relative entropy \r\nwith respect to the growing dimension. In other part, \r\nit is proposed to perform a systematic study of the \r\ndimensional behavior of the entropy and information for \r\ndifferent classes of probability distributions, satisfying \r\nconvexity conditions. In particular, new concentration properties \r\nof the information content will be considered for dependent \r\nhigh-dimensional data. It is planned to introduce and explore \r\nspecial positions of probability measures, responsible for \r\ncorrect behaviour of sums of independent summands\r\n(when the entropy power inequality can be reversed).\r\nAnother part addresses the stability problem, raised by Kac \r\nand McKean, in the entropic variant of Cramer's\r\ncharacterization of the normal law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main theme of the proposal is the development of the \r\ninformation-theoretic approach to high dimensional phenomena,\r\nwith focus on obtaining new asymptotic bounds on the entropy and \r\ninformation. The study of entropy is dictated by various \r\napplications within and beyond pure mathematics. Entropy plays \r\na key role in statistical physics (in order to capture\r\nthe amount of disorder in a system), in statistics\r\n(to measure the performance of statistical estimators),\r\nin engineering and mathematical theory of communication.\r\nThe proposed research also aims to provide new connections between \r\nprobability, geometric functional analysis and information theory,\r\nand to demonstrate an increasing role of entropy\r\nbounds in purely mathematical fields.\r\n\r\nAn integral component of the project is the involvement and \r\ntraining of the graduate and undergraduate students.",
