 "awd_abstract_narration": "*** Non-technical ***\r\nOne major challenge now being posed for fundamental science and technology is to detect, understand and control spins-an ensemble of nanomagnets-in complex systems within one hundred quadrillionth of a second. On one hand, the complex structures made of inter-connected, individual nano-magnetic building blocks can exhibit valuable characteristics and improved functionalities, which are fundamentally different from the sum of their components. On the other hand, such dynamic magnetic processes are at least 1000 times faster than those of the traditional thermal-magnetic processes used thus far, and thereby carry great promise to exceed the upper limit of the magnetic switching speed (0.1-10 GHz) in modern magneto-optical recording industry and enable extremely high-speed magnetic storage/logic devices. This proposal has identified some major opportunities to address these problems via exploiting ultrashort flashes of mid-infrared and far-infrared (trillion cycles per second) electromagnetic radiation. Success in this \"ultrafast spin challenge\" will reveal as-yet-undiscovered dynamic processes in advanced magnetic systems, and offer ultimate solution towards the problems indentified. The proposal consists of interconnected, specific plans for education and outreach that span high school teachers and their students, undergraduate and graduate level student training; seeks to attract and keep talented students in careers in sciences, and mentor them along their journey to success; develop new courses with complementary hands-on laboratory modules emphasizing ultrafast laser technology, coupled to undergraduate and graduate curriculum.\r\n*** Technical ***\r\nThis proposal explores ultrafast magnetic phenomena in nanoscale and complex magnetic systems using dynamic magneto-optical spectroscopic methods exploiting femtosecond laser excitations.  One of the most challenging questions in condensed matter physics and materials science today is whether one can detect, understand and control macroscopic magnetic orders in their highly non-equilibrium, non-thermal states at femtosecond time scales.  Such processes are at least 1000 times faster than those of the traditional thermal-magnetic processes used thus far, and thereby carry great promise to exceed the upper limit of the magnetic switching speed (0.1-10 GHz) in modern magneto-optical recording industry and enable extremely high-speed magnetic storage/logic devices.  However, thus far how photoexcited coherence and/or non-thermal carriers can substantially modify the macroscopic ordering at such time scales has been poorly addressed to date and most of the predicted exotic properties of photo-driven magnetic systems have yet to be observed. This proposal will explore photoinduced non-thermal, fs magnetic phase transition and significantly advance our knowledge of quantum spin systems driven far from the equilibrium. The proposal consists of interconnected, specific plans for education and outreach that span high school teachers and their students, undergraduate and graduate level student training; develop new courses with complementary hands-on laboratory modules emphasizing ultrafast laser technology.",

Our results provide evidence that ultrashort laser-induced polarization can be used to manipulate magnetic order during a laser pulse.&nbsp; The idea is to draw on an analogy to chemistry and photosynthetic dynamics&mdash;in which photo-products of chemical and biochemical reactions can be influenced by creating suitable coherent superpositions of molecular states.&nbsp; Consequently, ultrashort-laser-excited coherence can create a controllable transient superposition of quantum spin/charge states that switch magnetic order via &lsquo;suddenly&rsquo; breaking the delicate balance between competing phases of magnetic materials.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;Second, we propose protocols, analogous to multidimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, but using phase-coherent trains of 100fs laser pulses, for full coherent-control of all-optical magnetic switching in magnetic semiconductors.

To accomplish this, we explore large transient magnetic nonlinearities that are not accessible close to quasi-equilibrium, which we can create only by tuning coherent ultrafast superpositions of electronic quantum states and not via incoherent photoexcited populations or classical quasi-thermal effects.
