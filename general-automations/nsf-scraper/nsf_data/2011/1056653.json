 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nUnderstanding and controlling self-assembly is crucial for engineering advanced materials from nanoscale precursors. Magnetotactic bacteria, which navigate in the earth?s magnetic field using magnetically-coupled chains of iron oxide nanoparticles, have inspired this project. The objective of this CAREER award, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program (SSMC), is to demonstrate and understand the magnetic field-driven self-assembly of magnetic and multifunctional nanoparticles into chains in bulk matrices, and to measure and understand the novel structures and magnetic, optical, mechanical, and electrical properties of these nanostructured composites. Magnetic field-driven self-assembly of nanoparticles in bulk matrices is a largely unexplored area, which has potential to arrange chains in three-dimensional arrays with tunable spacing without using a template. The concept of magnetic field-driven self-assembly is of broad significance: Chains of multifunctional nanoparticles can also be assembled if one component is magnetic. This research project and related topics will be integrated into the PI?s Introduction to Nanomaterials course and into a nanoscience and nanotechnology lab course that he is developing.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThere is a great need to develop methods to fabricate macroscopic, three-dimensional composites with precisely controlled structures. The research component of this CAREER award, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program (SSMC), is an investigation of how applying magnetic fields causes magnetic nanoparticles to form chains with uniform dimensions and spacing.  An understanding of the influence of the make-up of the nanoparticle and the strength of the magnetic field on the formation of these new structures will be useful for developing methods to control precisely the assembly of nanoparticles and for the fabrication of new composite materials.  Interactions among the assembled nanoparticles and with the surrounding matrix are expected to give rise to novel properties that are potentially useful for diverse applications. In the outreach component of this award, the PI will develop a Nanotechnology Outreach Program (NOP) in collaboration with a professor of education and a high school teacher. The NOP will include visits by the PI and students to surrounding high school classes to give demonstrations and lectures on nanotechnology and teacher workshops arranged through school districts that will introduce the concepts of nanotechnology and will include materials that could be used in teachers? lesson plans.",
