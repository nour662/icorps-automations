 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract:\r\nThe electrons in a number of recently discovered materials with exciting new properties tread a fine line between two extremes: one of independent electrons largely ignoring one another (such as in good metals) and one where electrons interact so strongly with each other that they foster collective behavior.  These new classes of so-called intermediate bandwidth systems occupy a unique regime where the coupling between an electron's atomic orbital motion and its intrinsic magnetic field (or spin) plays an important role in generating new electronic behavior.  This project will support a neutron scattering-based experimental research program exploring the fundamental electronic behavior in three key classes of these new spin-orbit coupled materials: iron-based high temperature superconductors, iridium oxide insulators, and topological insulators; many of which possess potential for future energy transport and computing applications.  The project will also support the growth of materials necessary to attack key research problems while simultaneously addressing the large national need for creative materials exploration.  In addition to supporting the education of two PhD students, the project will also provide hands-on, research-based, education to underrepresented high school interns and undergraduates. The synergy fostered by this project's integration of research and educational activities will also advance a broader goal of training the next generation of neutron scattering experts in the United States.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThis award will support a neutron scattering-based experimental research program whose goal is to understand magnetism and competing order's role in the electronic behavior of an emerging class of intermediate bandwidth materials where strong spin-orbital coupling effects conspire to create novel properties.  These materials occupy a unique coupling regime (U~W) where modest correlation can exert a dramatic influence within their resulting ground states.  This project will focus on three classes of these materials where magnetic and orbital degrees of freedom are thought to play a key role: iron pnictide high temperature superconductors, novel 5d Mott insulators, and perturbed topological insulators.  Work will be guided by the project-supported growth of the crystalline materials necessary to attack key issues while simultaneously addressing the large national need for creative materials exploration. In addition to supporting the education of two PhD students, the project will also provide hands-on, research-based, education to underrepresented high school interns and undergraduates.  The synergy fostered by this project's integration of research and educational activities will also advance a broader goal of training the next generation of neutron scattering experts in the United States.",
