 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science and Mathematics Simulated Interaction Model (SIM) will design and clinically test simulations for mathematics and science teachers. The main hypothesis is that mathematics and science simulations will identify strengths and misconceptions in teachers' understanding of content and pedagogy, increase teachers\u00a1 instructional capacity, and advance student achievement. The SIM will be designed for both preservice (in training) and induction-stage (early career) mathematics and science teachers. The eight different SIM simulations will focus on common problems of practice, challenges, dilemmas, issues that mathematics and science teachers encounter at the secondary level (grades 9-12). The Syracuse University School of Education and SUNY Upstate Medical University's Clinical Skills Center have partnered together in past simulation design and research endeavors. Through their SIM partnership, these organizations now focus on the first exploration of content-specific simulations. When designed and clinically tested, the researchers expect the SIM to serve as an innovative teacher development tool that helps novice mathematics and science teachers effectively transition from preservice preparation to classroom practice. \r\n\r\nThe heart of the SIM is a series of live, one-to-one interactions between novice mathematics and science teachers and standardized individuals (SIs). Similar to medical education's use of standardized patients, the SIM's standardized individuals are local actors who are carefully trained and scripted to present to novice teachers distinct mathematics or science problems, questions, or dilemmas. For example, how do novice mathematics teachers navigate a conversation with a standardized student who questions the relevance of advanced mathematics? Similarly, how do novice science teachers navigate a difficult conversation with a standardized parent who questions the teaching of evolutionary biology? Each teacher's simulation is immediately followed by an individual debriefing and a written improvement plan in a highly structured simulation to reflection to improvement plan cycle of assistance. Each simulation cycle is coupled with a content-specific seminar designed to support teachers' strengths and to address their content or pedagogical misconceptions. The SIM is structured as an iterative design project, where the initial design of the eight simulations will be clinically tested twice. 40 novice teachers (20 preservice and 20 induction stages) will take part in the clinical testing process. SIM data strands include pre-simulation questions, audio/video data of the simulated interactions between teachers and SIs, post-simulation teacher video reflections, and written professional improvement plans. The research team will focus on refining the simulations and  identifying the teachers' strengths and misconceptions based on 160 different simulated interactions. \r\n\r\nWhen complete, the SIM will consist of eight simulations that effectively identify the content and pedagogical strengths and misconceptions of secondary mathematics and science teachers. Initially, the SIM will be implemented within the Syracuse University School of Education. SIM products, processes, and all findings will be made available to all education researchers and teacher educators through password-protected digital access. The SIM's problem-based methodology challenges novice teachers to enact content and pedagogy, while also helping researchers to accurately and meaningfully assess teacher strengths and misconceptions in mathematics and science. As data are gathered and analyzed for each SIM problem of practice, we anticipate the formation of grounded theories and models of mathematics and science teacher development. These data - gathered through a methodology that places novice teachers in immediate, demanding, authentic situations - hold the potential to yield broader understandings of how novice science and mathematics teachers are transferring the content and pedagogy learned within teacher preparation into actual teacher practice.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Schools of Education work closely with K-12 teachers to help future teachers experience different challenges &ndash; working with parents, writing lesson plans, teaching, supporting struggling students, etc.  Despite these sincere efforts, it is common for a young teacher to experience &ndash; in training &ndash; only a fraction of the many challenges s/he will face as a licensed, new teacher.  For example, a future math teacher may have several opportunities to observe and teach in advanced mathematics courses like Algebra II and Trigonometry, but may not ever have the opportunity to communicate with a student who is struggling with basic algebraic functions (like solving for \u00e6x\u00c6 or multiplying negative numbers).  To complicate matters, a given group of 20 future math or science teachers are typically placed across many different classrooms, where some will have certain instructional opportunities, and others will not.  For example, only 1-2 future teachers may have the opportunity to speak with parents about a concern they have about science or mathematics content, leaving the other 18-19 future teachers without access to this very important learning experience. \n\n            The purpose of the Science and Mathematics Simulated Interaction Model (SIM) is to help fill in the gaps of current teaching preparation practices.  To do so, the leading faculty member, Dr. Benjamin Dotger, examined one specific technique used to teach future doctors.  In every U.S. medical school, future doctors engage in simulations with standardized patients.  A standardized patient is a healthy individual who is carefully trained to portray a patient with an illness, injury, or health concern.  The purpose of the simulation is to give the future doctor the opportunity to examine the standardized patient, diagnose the health concern, and communicate a regimen of treatment.  Medical simulations are video recorded, and serve as one a series of tests that all future doctors must pass before they become licensed professionals.\n\n            In similar fashion, Dr. Dotger began using standardized students and parents in science and mathematics simulations for future teachers.  The purpose is to provide all future mathematics teachers in a cohort &ndash; and not just 1-2 teachers who happen to be placed in a specific classroom &ndash; with the same opportunity.  For example, in a math simulation, each future math teacher has the opportunity to interact face-to-face with a standardized student.  This student is a local actor who has been carefully trained to represent a struggling 10th grade student.  In simulation, the future math teacher has the opportunity to work directly with the student, review her algebra homework, diagnose the errors the student has made, and teach the student how to correctly interpret similar algebra problems.  Importantly, these simulations are video-recorded, giving this future math teacher and her peers a chance to carefully deconstruct what she said and did as she worked to help the (standardized) student.  Since all math teachers in the cohort engaged with the same standardized student &ndash; who presented the same algebra struggles &ndash; each teacher had the opportunity to put into practice what s/he has been taught as a teacher-in-training. \n\n As a second example, consider the opportunity each future science teacher has to engage with a standardized parent who questions the teaching of evolutionary biology.  This is a very real challenge that all future secondary science teachers are likely to encounter.  Therefore, one simulation directly situates each future science teacher in a one-to-one interaction with a standardized parent who expresses concerns about this portion of the science class, asks what alternatives there are to evolutionary biology, and questions the logic of teaching this content.  This simulation represents another important opportunity for all future science teachers to practice engaging in, and rec..."
