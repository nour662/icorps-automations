 "awd_abstract_narration": "Voice conversion (VC) systems transform segments of speech from a given source speaker so that it\r\ncan be identified as spoken by a specified target speaker. Currently, standard VC systems require\r\nparallel training on extensively labeled sets of speech data where the source and target speaker share\r\nequivalent content for building direct mapping models. This project builds on the concepts of nonparallel\r\nVC systems reducing the need for labeled and shared speech content between source and target\r\nspeakers as well as allowing for both intra-lingual and cross-lingual conversion scenarios. This project\r\nfocuses on two main areas: (1) Building a framework for non-parallel VC without explicit phonetic,\r\nsound, word, or sentence level labels, and (2) Providing effective target speaker mapping to obtain\r\nconverted speech with as good as or better quality compared to current VC systems. The VC\r\nframework consists of three main components: (1) A speaker independent language model; (2) An\r\nalgorithm for model adaptation to target speaker; (3) A speech synthesis block to generate converted\r\nspeech from a target-adapted language model.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide a broad framework for applications such as personalization of assistive textto-\r\nspeech (TTS) systems, foreign language learning, and as a possible component in speech-to-speech\r\ntranslation systems. This project will support graduate student research and provide results for\r\ncommunity distribution through conference and journal submission. Additionally, an open-source\r\nsoftware toolset will be developed and freely distributed. The project will also be used in outreach for\r\nunderrepresented groups in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines.",
