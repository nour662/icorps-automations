 "awd_abstract_narration": "New recording methods allow researchers to probe the structure of neural activity with unprecedented scope and detail.  As a result there is an explosion of interest in understanding the patterns of activity that emerge in entire neuronal populations and relating these patterns to the function of the nervous system.   However, the overwhelming range of different sensory inputs that these populations receive -- and the vast range of different responses that these inputs evoke -- make it impossible to achieve this goal based on empirical observations alone. This challenge is compounded due to the nonlinearity of neuronal network dynamics, which makes it difficult to predict patterns of activity by extrapolation from observations of simpler systems.  Predictive mathematical modeling and a deeper understanding of the dynamics of neuronal circuits is therefore required.  With previous NSF support, the investigators developed numerical and analytic tools at the interface of statistics, stochastic analysis and nonlinear dynamics, to understand the genesis and impact of correlations in simple, but fundamental microcircuits.  They build on these results by extending the underlying mathematical theory to more complex and realistic networks.  Using this approach, the team of researchers examines how collective activity is controlled by network architecture, cell dynamics, and stimulus drive in a set of neural networks that typify structures across the nervous system.\r\n\r\nAnswering these questions will open the door to contemporary biological applications and will meet key theoretical challenges posed by recent technological developments in experimental neuroscience. The key innovation lies in the understanding the collective dynamics of large neural networks that cannot be decomposed into their isolated parts. Through continued interactions with a broad set of experimental collaborators, these ideas are introduced and tested by a broad community of neuroscientists.  In the longer term, results on coding in the presence of collective network dynamics will impact the design of neural prosthetics, which code sensory signals via cortical, retinal, and thalamic implants.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe nervous system is distinguished in biology through two features.  First, the complexity of the interconnections between neurons is unmatched.  Different neurons, of different classes and types, all wire together in a complex tapestry.  Second, the cognitive functions that neural dynamics support are amazing, from scene processing in the visual system, to cognitive decision making in higher brain areas, and finally to motor control that enable complex motions like running or playing a musical instrument.  Linking the circuit structure of the nervous system to its functioning is a core challenge in neuroscience, and it will take a suite of researchers to tackle this problem.  Proposal NSF-1121784: Collaborative Research: Relating Architecture, Dynamics, and Temporal Correlations in Networks of Spiking Neurons brings together three theoretical neuroscientists to continue their research program to provide a coherent mathematical framework to study the relation between neural circuitry and function.   \n\n \n\nNeurons produce a sequence of discrete events, called action potential or spikes, that serve as a communication channel for neurons to interact with one another.  Across the nervous system the spiking activity of neuron pairs are correlated, and the level of correlation is malleable depending on the statistics of sensory input or the level of subject arousal or attention.  We have used modern techniques from statistical mechanics to build theories for how the wiring structure determines the correlation between the spiking output of neurons embedded in a wired network.  Our theories are quite general and allowed us to ask targeted question about how specific wiring assumptions translate to specific correlation patterns with the network.  For instance, some neurons excite other neurons and promote spiking, while other neurons inhibit spiking.  When a neuron excites two target neurons then the target neurons are promoted to fire together.  Similarly, when an inhibitory neuron inhibits two targets then joint silence is produced.   However, when networks with combined excitation and inhibition are studied then these effects can cancel one another and the output from neurons are roughly uncorrelated.  This result is general, however through collaborations with our experimental colleagues we found evidence for this dynamic in the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish and the coding of whisker movement in the somatosensory cortex of rodents. \n\n \n\nIn a related line of research we consider networks of recurrently coupled neurons with complex wiring diagrams.  We were able to explicitly express the degree of correlation between pairs of neurons in terms of the frequency of certain motifs in the network graph. Thus, we could assign the impact of, for instance diverging connections (neurons that project to many targets) on the final correlated state of the network.  This will give invaluable insights as experimentalists continue to collect synaptic wiring as well as populations recordings and wish to link these disparate datasets.\n\n \n\nIn conclusion, our proposal produced a wealth of theory from which to springboard new projects in circuit and systems neuroscience.  This will allow theoretical and mathematical neuroscientists to better engage with the ever increasing work from the neuroscience community at large.              \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brent D Doiron"
