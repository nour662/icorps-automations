 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antarctic channichthyid icefishes are stunning examples of the unique physiological traits that can arise during evolution in a constantly cold environment. Icefishes are the only vertebrates that as adults, lack the circulating oxygen-binding protein hemoglobin (Hb); several species within this family also lack the intracellular oxygen-binding protein myoglobin (Mb) in their heart ventricle. The loss of Hb and Mb has resulted in striking modifications in the cardiovascular system to ensure adequate tissue oxygenation, some of which are energetically costly. Recent indicate there may be at least one benefit to not expressing these heme-centered proteins - oxidized proteins and lipids are higher in red-blooded notothenioids compared to icefishes. The research will address the hypothesis that the loss of Hb and Mb reduces oxidative stress in icefishes compared to red-blooded notothenioid fishes, resulting in a lower rate of protein turnover and energetic cost savings. Specifically, the project will (1)  Characterize levels of oxidative stress in red- and white-blooded notothenioid fishes, (2) Determine if red- and white-blooded notothenioids differ in their regulation of iron, (3) Determine if lower levels of oxidized proteins in icefishes result in lower rates of protein turnover and energetic cost savings, and (4) Determine if oxygen-binding proteins promote oxidative stress in-vivo and in-vitro.\r\n\r\nThe results will contribute to the understanding of iron-catalyzed oxidative stress, which is associated with the progression of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, the research will increase understanding of factors related to iron metabolism and oxidative stress in notothenioid fishes that may have played key roles in the success of channichthyid icefishes. The broader impacts include development of a website will enable teachers and students to learn more about the fascinating biology of Antarctic icefishes, as well as the impacts of global climate change and commercial fishing activities on Antarctic fishes. Additionally, Alaska Native high school and undergraduate students will be involved in research at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.",

Icefishes are the only vertebrates on earth that lack Hb. The loss Hb occurred once during the evolution of Antarctic fishes and is thought to be a neutral mutation that neither enhances nor diminishes fitness because of the prevailing conditions (icy-cold, oxygen-rich waters; little competition and extensive habitat) in the Southern Ocean.&nbsp;Six species of icefishes also lack the intracellular oxygen-binding protein, myoglobin (Mb), in their heart muscle. The loss of Mb expression is more puzzling than the loss of Hb because mutations in DNA leading to the loss of Mb have occurred three times during the evolution of icefishes, suggesting weakened selective pressure maintaining expression of the protein. In other words, if it is not essential to cardiac function, the ability to synthesize it is lost (ie; &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo;), and yet studies have shown that when Mb is present, hearts perform better than those lacking the protein.</p>\n<p>Oxygen is often described as a Janus-faced molecule because although essential for most living organisms, it is a powerful oxidant, capable of wrecking havoc on biological macromolecules when it gains electrons and forms reactive oxygen species (ROS). When oxygen binds Hb or Mb, interactions between Hb or Mb and oxygen can accelerate the formation of ROS. We tested the hypothesis that rather than being neutral mutations, the loss of Hb and Mb might be advantageous if their loss results in a decrease in oxidative damage to biological macromolecules (DNA, proteins and lipids), resulting in lower rates of protein breakdown and synthesis to replace damaged proteins, thereby reducing the amount of energy that must be devoted to building new proteins.</p>\n<p>We have found that the loss of Hb and Mb does not, in fact, always minimize oxidative damage of biological macromolecules, nor does it result in lower rates of protein synthesis or degradation. Surprisingly, we found that levels of oxidized proteins and lipids are higher in some tissues of icefishes compared to red-blooded species. We determined that oxidative damage is often best correlated with aerobic metabolic capacity, or the rate at which oxygen is used to breakdown food and convert it into a usable form of energy, ATP. In summary, our results show that the loss of Hb and Mb does not confer an advantage to icefishes in terms of redox balance. Results from our work has led to a greater understanding of the evolution of Antarctic fishes and the mechanisms responsible for oxidative stress, which is a phenomenon associated with multiple human diseases (cancer, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, Huntington&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s) and aging.</p>\n<p>Throughout the work on this project, we have educated the public about Antarctica, the unique biology of the fishes that inhabit the Southern Ocean, and the impacts of commercial fishing and climate change in Antarctica.
