Since year 2001, CCS started accommodating series of workshops to explore security issues in a variety of emerging areas. CCS workshops quickly become active forums for researchers to form focus groups, discuss and collaborate on emerging and critical security problems, and disseminate fresh, revolutionary (and sometimes even controversial) ideas. These workshops also serve as natural venues to bring together researchers from multiple disciplines to address security issues in specific domains, such as smartphone technology, cloud computing and national critical infrastructures.",
