 "awd_abstract_narration": "The discovery of RNA interference mediated gene silencing by double-stranded RNA is one of the most exciting recent developments in the biological and biomedical sciences. RNAi utilizes a pathway whereby a double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) targets and destroys complementary mRNA in eukaryotic cells to regulate gene expression. Since its discovery just over a decade ago scientists have investigated the potential use of siRNA-based treatment of many diseases such as cancer, liver cirrhosis, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus, and hypercholesterolemia. In principle, siRNA has much broader therapeutic applications than other types of drugs because siRNA can be synthetically designed to silence any gene via the RNAi machinery. Therefore, the primary challenge for therapeutic applications is efficient and non-toxic delivery of siRNA to cells within tissues of interest. The research goal of this CDI project is to design efficient delivery systems for siRNA via supercomputer simulations. Multimillion-atom simulations are performed to study: (1) the effect of siRNAs on the molecular structure of lipid membranes and how structural changes affect the membrane permeability; (2) molecular mechanisms by which siRNA molecules attached to gold nanoparticles cross the membrane and go into a cell; and (3) delivery of siRNAs encapsulated in liposomes by ultrasound. Computational technologies will be used to enable automated design of efficient siRNA delivery systems. This project is promoting scholastic and professional excellence among students. A dual-degree program has been established which gives students the opportunity to obtain a Ph.D. in the physical sciences or an engineering discipline and an M.S. in computer science with specialization in high performance computing and simulations. This research team will also organize computational science workshops for undergraduate students and faculty mentors from Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions.",

To this end, the project has resulted in significant research outcomes,\nsoftware artifacts, and biological insights and datasets.\n\n<strong>Motivation</strong>: Understanding the precise regulatory role of ncRNAs (siRNAs, miRNAs, and others) is\nof great interest, since they have been shown to play important roles in development, diseases,\nand other biological processes. Early work on prediction of targets of ncRNAs focused on\nstatic sequence-driven miRNA-mRNA complementarity.

Specifically, the project resulted in the following\noutcomes:\n\n- We have developed a suite of SVM-based classifiers, called Avishkar, to\ndifferentiate miRNA targets and non-targets, designed as a bipartite classification problem.\nWe focus on non-canonical gene targets and come up with a new metric to measure the\nenrichment of ``seed\" regions (described later), and to maximize the classifier signal by\nusing non-parametric curves to relax the difficult-to-handle discrete features,\nsuch as sequence-based and biophysical, thermodynamic features.\n\n- We have developed a general-purpose distributed implementation of non-linear Avishkar and\nopen sourced it (https://bitbucket.org/cellsandmachines/kernelsvmspark) for use by\nthe community.\n\n- We have designed a context-specific version of Avishkar that can predict expression in\n13 different types of cancers and open sourced the visualization of these interactions\n(http://cygnus.ecn.purdue.edu).\n\n- We have developed a deep learning framework called Tiresias, which can identify the presence\nand strength of miRNA-gene interactions using a two-step process, by combining sequence and\nexpression data.\n\n\n<strong>Detailed Methods and Results</strong>\n\nWe have developed a powerful new suite of classifiers, based on support vector machines (SVMs) and\ndeep networks.

We open sourced our implementation, which will be invaluable to a number\nof scientific communities.\n\n<strong>Context-specific regulation</strong>. Recent research also utilizes expression-level data, e.g., from\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas, to study context-dependent regulation effects in a more dynamic,\nphysiologically-relevant setting. To address this, we consider the expression data of miRNAs and\nmRNAs from TCGA for thirteen different cancer types and use a sparse regression method (Elastic\nNet) to estimate which miRNAs upregulate or downregulate which mRNAs.
