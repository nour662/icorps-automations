 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Protein Folding and Dynamics Research Coordination Network (RCN), which is jointly supported by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, is to promote interactions that would transform the understanding of the mechanism by which the amino acid sequence of a protein directs its rapid and efficient folding to the native, functional conformation. To achieve this goal, a group of experienced investigators with complementary expertise in both experimental and computational/theoretical biophysics have established a consortium whose intentions are to integrate their combined efforts on the folding reactions of a select set of targets. Repeated cycles of computer simulations by theorists and experimental validation by bench scientists on a set of common targets are expected to significantly accelerate progress on the solution to the folding problem and transform the way one thinks about the relationship between the sequence, folding and structure of proteins. A solution to the protein folding problem would resolve one of the remaining fundamental challenges in biology, provide essential insights for the design of innovative industrial catalysts and substantially improve the yields of protein products in the biotechnology arena. The networking activities of the RCN will primarily flow through the frequent interactions among the members of each project team via the internet. Network activities will also include two meetings each year, one involving the core participants and the second involving members of their research groups. A dynamic and  inclusive culture for the consortium will be promoted by invitations to other investigators and their students who are willing to share their complementary expertise in collaborations with core members of the project teams. These invited investigators are also expected to bring new protein targets to the consortium to expand the repertoire of motifs under study.\r\n\r\nThe RCN will support a new paradigm for solving complex problems in biology. This paradigm will take the form of concerted efforts from multiple labs with complementary expertise in experimental and theoretical/computational science to solve the folding problem. It is anticipated that success in this endeavor will inspire the formation of new consortia to solve other complex problems in biology. The RCN will also recruit a new generation of scientists from a broad range of disciplines to develop new approaches towards the solution of the protein folding problem. By recasting the protein folding problem in terms of the inherent physical properties of the folding reaction, the PI expects to attract the participation of young physicists, engineers, computer scientists, chemists and others who will bring their unique skills and perspectives towards its solution. These young scientists will also benefit from participating in collaborative research efforts and, perhaps, will seek similar opportunities as they build their own careers. It is expected that success in this project will have numerous societal benefits, including the elimination of the toxic solvents and wastes emanating from many industrial processes, the design of new biodegradable materials with remarkable properties and the training of the next generation of scientists.",
