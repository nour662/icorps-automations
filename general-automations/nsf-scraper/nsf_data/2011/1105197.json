In the field of quantum coherent superconducting devices, recent dramatic advances have made it possible to produce resonant circuits that can store a single quantized excitation of the microwave field, or photon. In this project, experiments will be performed to study the dynamics of a single vortex coupled to a single microwave photon, thus applying state-of-the-art quantum coherent circuit technology to address key fundamental problems in condensed matter physics. Following the fabrication of nanoscale vortex confining structures, measurements of the resonators at millikelvin temperatures will provide a unique probe of the dynamics of a single vortex. In addition, such structures will allow for studies of the coupling of a single microwave photon to quantized amounts of dissipation as vortices are added one at a time. The proposed work will engage a diverse team of students in cutting-edge scientific endeavors and will provide them with training in key technological areas such as nanofabrication and microwave engineering.

These vortices have been studied from a variety of vantage points, including for the many technological applications of superconductors in the modern world. Nonetheless, some fundamental questions remain, such as the possibility for a vortex to tunnel quantum mechanically through a barrier. In the field of quantum coherent superconducting devices, recent dramatic advances have made it possible to produce circuits that can store a single quantized microwave excitation, or photon. In this project, experiments will be performed to study the dynamics of a single vortex coupled to a single microwave photon, thus applying state-of-the-art quantum coherent circuit technology to address key fundamental problems in condensed matter physics. Following the fabrication of vortex confining structures at the nearby, NSF-funded Cornell NanoScale Facility, measurements at temperatures near absolute zero will provide a unique probe of the dynamics of a single vortex. Such structures will also allow for coupling a single microwave photon to quantized amounts of dissipation as vortices are added one at a time.
