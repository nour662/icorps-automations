 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University (NCA&T), the largest HBCU in North Carolina, will acquire and operate a high performance modeling and visualization system to support active research and training programs in mathematical biology and mathematical geosciences involving faculty from the departments of Energy and Environmental Systems, Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry and Biology with research programs in storm and weather prediction; epidemiology and system biology; protein pathways and blood coagulation; and biological based response models of environmental pollutants.   The system will include at least 16 compute nodes, 96 TB of storage and a tiled display wall.\r\n\r\nThe system will enable broader impacts by supporting work in mathematical biology and mathematical geosciences including the integration of research activities and student development.  It will significantly advance research and training activities in mathematical and computational modeling and scientific visualization at NCA&T.  The program will synthesize research efforts that link student research engagement with hands-on experience of utilizing the HPC modeling and visualization system to increase the exposure to a larger number of the students and their faculty advisors, including undergraduate students.  The cross-cutting nature of the projects that will be supported on the system will be reinforced with integrative classroom learning.",
