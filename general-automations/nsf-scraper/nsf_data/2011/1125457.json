 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Description:\r\n\r\nThis STEP Center project is establishing a national resource that is focused on innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E) for engineers. The objective of the center is to catalyze a wave of change in undergraduate engineering education in the United States through initiatives that inspire students to envision possibilities and create viable, innovative products, services, and processes for lasting economic and societal impact. It is influencing educators and students at a national level by: 1) building upon a foundation of principles from three distinct, yet complementary fields: learning sciences, engineering education, and I&E education, 2) drawing on the content and expertise of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program (STVP) and other institutions and partners to create a coherent set of learning materials and methods that are collected and curated, 3) providing a \"Pathway to Proficiency\" platform for teaching and learning about engineering innovation and entrepreneurship, 4) conducting scholarly research on how people learn to be innovative and entrepreneurial, and develop instruments and processes others can use to assess students' innovation skills, and 5) performing an on-going assessment and garnering feedback to improve/enhance its impact and reach. The center also offers a research and outreach web portal/hub for the creation, collection, and sharing of resources on how to educate the next generation of engineering innovators and entrepreneurs. This STEP Center is jointly funded by EHR's Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) and ENG's Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC).\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Significance:\r\n\r\nThe goal of the STEP Center is to reshape undergraduate engineering education and enhance U.S. competitiveness. The STEP Center is providing a diverse set of offerings and, through a partnership with the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA), is implementing multi-faceted dissemination approaches that reach a large number of faculty and students across the U.S. It is developing tools and processes to help others measure I&E skills; while investigating and pursuing additional ways to enhance STEM enrollment among underrepresented groups. Through research, the STEP Center aims to discover novel insights into how engineers become more innovative and entrepreneurial and what inhibits or blocks the development of these skills.",

Activities included the </span><a href=\"http://epicenter.stanford.edu/page/epicenter-retreat\"><span>Epicenter Retreat</span></a><span> in September 2012 for innovation and entrepreneurship (I&amp;E) educators to collaborate on projects of shared interest, a survey administered to members of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) to understand the needs of engineering faculty and administrators, and </span><a href=\"http://epicenter.stanford.edu/story/nae-bridge-summer-2013\"><span>an article</span></a><span> by Epicenter leaders in the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) journal, The Bridge. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>As a result of this exploration, the Epicenter team pivoted from platform development to individual and community engagement, and created three initiatives focused on students, faculty and research: </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The </span><strong><a href=\"http://epicenter.stanford.edu/page/university-innovation-fellows\">University Innovation Fellows</a> </strong><span><strong>program </strong>trains students to analyze their campus I&amp;E ecosystems and create educational opportunities for their peers. During the Epicenter grant, the program trained 607 students at 143 institutions, including STEM and non-STEM students. Fellows created hundreds of activities at their schools related to innovation, entrepreneurship, design thinking and creativity. In 2015-16, these activities included more than 269 extracurricular events, 239 extracurricular programs, 169 academic offerings and 137 spaces, with more reported in progress at the end of the grant. Fellows also collaborate with academic leaders to create lasting institutional change and represent their schools at conferences alongside program team members. They take part in national initiatives such as </span><a href=\"http://epicenter.stanford.edu/page/press-release-20-schools-take-part-in-national-student-orientation-initiative-uifresh\"><span>#uifresh</span></a><span>, during which 30 Fellows&rsquo; schools exposed first-year students to I&amp;E during orientation.

During the Epicenter grant, Pathways worked with teams from 50 schools to analyze their campus assets and utilize a strategic planning process to integrate I&amp;E into their ecosystems. The Pathways teams worked on more than 400 projects designed to implement sustained changes to the undergraduate experience. These included extracurricular programming; courses and programs; campus policy changes such as intellectual property; tenure and promotion; new positions; makerspaces; entrepreneurship centers; funding through industry partnership and grants; and dissemination of best practices through conferences and journals. The teams engaged 30,000 undergraduate engineering students at their schools as well as undergraduate and graduate students from other disciplines. In addition, nine Pathways schools became I-Corps sites. The program created a community of practice of more than 400 faculty from STEM, business and non-STEM faculty. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The </span><strong><a href=\"http://epicenter.stanford.edu/page/fostering-innovative-generations-studies\">Fostering Innovative Generations Studies</a></strong><span> (FIGS) research initiative conducted a set of national studies of I&amp;E in engineering focused on three questions, from which have come numerous publications and conference presentations. The FIGS team also convened members of the research community around this topic, most notably in two summits in 2014 and 2016. In Spring 2015, the team launched the Engineering Majors Survey (EMS), a longitudinal </span><a href=\"http://epicenter.stanford.edu/page/engineering-majors-survey\"><span>study</span></a><span> administered to more than 30,000 engineering students from 27 universities, making it one of the largest longitudinal studies of engineers and I&amp;E to date. The results, shared with the individual survey campuses, generated knowledge about factors associated with students&rsquo; career decisions, I&amp;E experiences and I&amp;E self efficacy. A follow-up to the EMS was launched in Spring 2016. The third wave of the EMS is scheduled for Summer 2017, and the instrument has been adapted by researchers in the U.S. and Europe who are studying I&amp;E pathways.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>During the NSF grant, Epicenter engaged 174 institutions in one or more initiatives. In addition to the impacts above, the team published 25 papers; gave more than 50 presentations and workshops at conferences focused on I&amp;E; administered two ASEE community surveys; supported 12 Lean LaunchPad Educators workshops with 829 participants; supported four VentureWell OPEN conferences; and co-hosted two innovation </span><a href=\"http://epicenter.stanford.edu/story/uncf-hbcu-innovation-summit-2013\"><span>summits</span></a><span> in Silicon Valley that brought together leaders from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).

Activities included the Epicenter Retreat in September 2012 for innovation and entrepreneurship (I&amp;E) educators to collaborate on projects of shared interest, a survey administered to members of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) to understand the needs of engineering faculty and administrators, and an article by Epicenter leaders in the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) journal, The Bridge.  \nAs a result of this exploration, the Epicenter team pivoted from platform development to individual and community engagement, and created three initiatives focused on students, faculty and research: \nThe University Innovation Fellows program trains students to analyze their campus I&amp;E ecosystems and create educational opportunities for their peers. During the Epicenter grant, the program trained 607 students at 143 institutions, including STEM and non-STEM students. Fellows created hundreds of activities at their schools related to innovation, entrepreneurship, design thinking and creativity. In 2015-16, these activities included more than 269 extracurricular events, 239 extracurricular programs, 169 academic offerings and 137 spaces, with more reported in progress at the end of the grant. Fellows also collaborate with academic leaders to create lasting institutional change and represent their schools at conferences alongside program team members. They take part in national initiatives such as #uifresh, during which 30 Fellows? schools exposed first-year students to I&amp;E during orientation. This initiative was announced during the 2015 White House Science Fair and was supported by presidents of each school.\nThe Pathways to Innovation Program is a faculty development and institutional change initiative. During the Epicenter grant, Pathways worked with teams from 50 schools to analyze their campus assets and utilize a strategic planning process to integrate I&amp;E into their ecosystems. The Pathways teams worked on more than 400 projects designed to implement sustained changes to the undergraduate experience. These included extracurricular programming; courses and programs; campus policy changes such as intellectual property; tenure and promotion; new positions; makerspaces; entrepreneurship centers; funding through industry partnership and grants; and dissemination of best practices through conferences and journals. The teams engaged 30,000 undergraduate engineering students at their schools as well as undergraduate and graduate students from other disciplines. In addition, nine Pathways schools became I-Corps sites. The program created a community of practice of more than 400 faculty from STEM, business and non-STEM faculty. \nThe Fostering Innovative Generations Studies (FIGS) research initiative conducted a set of national studies of I&amp;E in engineering focused on three questions, from which have come numerous publications and conference presentations. The FIGS team also convened members of the research community around this topic, most notably in two summits in 2014 and 2016. In Spring 2015, the team launched the Engineering Majors Survey (EMS), a longitudinal study administered to more than 30,000 engineering students from 27 universities, making it one of the largest longitudinal studies of engineers and I&amp;E to date. The results, shared with the individual survey campuses, generated knowledge about factors associated with students? career decisions, I&amp;E experiences and I&amp;E self efficacy. A follow-up to the EMS was launched in Spring 2016. The third wave of the EMS is scheduled for Summer 2017, and the instrument has been adapted by researchers in the U.S. and Europe who are studying I&amp;E pathways.\nDuring the NSF grant, Epicenter engaged 174 institutions in one or more initiatives. In addition to the impacts above, the team published 25 papers; gave more than 50 presentations and workshops at conferences focused on I&amp;E; administered two ASEE community surveys; supported 12 Lean LaunchPad Educators workshops with 829 participants; supported four VentureWell OPEN conferences; and co-hosted two innovation summits in Silicon Valley that brought together leaders from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Epicenter also partnered with organizations including the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, American Society for Engineering Education, Engineering Deans Institute, and National Academy of Engineering.\n\nThe three Epicenter initiatives have continued after the end of the grant.
