 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site focuses on characterization of advanced materials. Under the supervision of faculty from Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Chemistry, and Civil Engineering, undergraduate student participants utilize tools such as electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, nanoindentation, and other methods to understand the relationships between the processing, structure and properties of a wide range of materials.  Ten undergraduate students, including freshmen and sophomores, from a wide variety of disciplines and schools are recruited nationwide every year for the ten-week summer research experience.  The Site also adds new faculty members over its life to encourage starting faculty to provide significant undergraduate research experiences.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to independent projects, students participate in a series of short workshops on research skills and presentation skills to enhance their ability to communicate their work to broad audiences.  Research projects are presented at a campus-wide poster session at the end of the summer with up to 100 participants. \r\n\r\nThis REU Site is suppported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
