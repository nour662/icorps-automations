 "awd_abstract_narration": "Very high-level, functional ability in foreign languages is increasingly important in many walks of life -- from business and science to diplomacy and national security. It is also very rare, and an early start and/or a special talent, or aptitude, for languages is believed to be necessary. Language aptitude is defined as a combination of cognitive/perceptual abilities measurable on a standardized test and advantageous in second language (L2) acquisition. Language aptitude has been related to variation in ultimate attainment (i.e., long-term differences in acquisition) in both classroom and immersion settings. This research will investigate the extent to which aptitude for explicit language learning, defined as \"language analytic ability,\" and implicit language learning, defined as \"sequence learning ability,\" are differentially important, as measured by performance on tasks that involve either controlled or automatic use of L2 knowledge. \r\n\r\nThere will be three groups of subjects: a control group of Spanish native speakers, and two groups of Chinese immigrants, long-term residents of Spain, who learned Spanish (a typologically very different L2) naturalistically, and whose first sustained exposure was either as children (ages 3 and 6) or adults (after 15). \r\n\r\nPrevious studies have relied on single measures of aptitude, weighted heavily in favor of cognitive abilities that allow for explicit learning (thought to be the primary adult learning process, as opposed to implicit learning by children), and single measures of attainment that favored controlled use of L2 knowledge. To correct for this, a metalinguistic knowledge test and a word-monitoring task, as well as four grammaticality judgment tests, will be used to assess the Chinese learners' Spanish under different conditions of time pressure (pressured/unpressured) and modality (visual/auditory). The results will help clarify the relative importance of starting age and type of language aptitude (explicit or implicit) for learners who need to achieve advanced L2 proficiency.",

Regarding cognitive findings, the project provided evidence of two main types of aptitude for language learning, labeled as Explicit Language Aptitude (ELA) and Implicit Language Aptitude (ILA) (Granena, 2013a). ELA was hypothesized to be relevant for explicit learning and processing, understood as learning that takes place intentionally through reasoning, deliberate hypothesis testing, and memorization. ILA was hypothesized to be relevant for implicit learning and processing, understood as learning from input in the absence of conscious intention to learn, conscious awareness of the fact that we are learning, and conscious attribution of any noticed change to the effects of learning. These two types of aptitudes played a differential role in the second language attainment of Chinese-Spanish bilingual speakers. &nbsp;ILA was related to attainment in formal, non-salient structures involving grammatical agreement in Spanish (gender, person and number agreement), but not in more salient structures involving meaning (passives, subjunctive, aspect). This suggested a differential role of aptitude depending on the type of language structure. Interestingly, the effects of aptitude were present in both early bilinguals who started learning the second language between ages 3 and 6, and late bilinguals who started learning the second language after age 16, but not in the native-speaker control group. This indicates that cognitive factors start compensating for age effects in second language learning as early as age 3. Regarding linguistic findings, the most relevant results were the significant differences in second language attainment between early bilinguals and native speakers, indicating that maturational (age) constraints have an effect on the acquisition of the second language morphosyntax as early as age 3. In addition, there were similarities between early and late bilinguals regarding the acquisition of grammatical agreement.
