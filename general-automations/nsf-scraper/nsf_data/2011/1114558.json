 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Herpetology Education in Rural Places & Spaces (HERPS) project is a  four-year full-scale development project designed to engage diverse  North Carolina residents from the Central Piedmont, Eastern Piedmont, and Inner Coastal Plain regions of the state in conservation and field experiences focused on herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians. The project targets rural underrepresented groups in STEM; predominately African-Americans, Hispanics, and Lumbee Native Americans. The University of North Carolina-Greensboro and its partner organizations, Elon University and University of North Carolina-Pembroke, will partner to develop and implement all phases of the project. Ultimately, the project aims to increase knowledge of and interest in herpetology and related conservation issues, provide authentic research experiences, and better understand identity-related motivations and affordances of the casual, regular, and enthusiastic participant across project strands. \r\n\r\nHERPS builds on four pilot studies and will engage people of all ages in a broad range of herpetological activities including: (a) an annual herpetology-focused community event (HERPS Celebrations), (b) technology resources such as a project website and customized mobile applications (HERPS Cyberhub), (c) summer and year-long herpetological research experiences (HREs) for high school students and teachers, and (d) in-depth longitudinal herpetological study opportunities (e.g., box turtle study). In addition, there is separate but integrated research stand that will focus on identity and HERPS experiences, as settings for informal science learning. The identity research will study:  (a) identity-related motivations and (b) identity-related affordances of casual, regular and enthusiastic participants across threads. In addition, an extensive formative and summative evaluation will be conducted using a mixed methods approach by an external evaluator. \r\n\r\nUsing a multiple-entry-points approach for learning and engagement, this project could serve as a replicable model for similar efforts in other settings. In addition, the results of the identity reseach strand could fill a critical gap in the identity and informal science education research bases. With an average estimated reach of nearly 15,000 people of all ages and diverse backgrounds, the potential broader impacts of this project could be extensive.",

Four threads of activity included: (1) annual community events to interest and educate the public about reptiles and amphibians; (2) HERPS Cyberhub, a website that links scientists, educators, and herp enthusiasts (theherpproject.uncg.edu); (3) Summer herpetological research experiences (HREs) for high school students and teachers; and (4) long-term Box Turtle mark-recapture studies that pair citizens with scientists. We targeted three rural, economically struggling NC regions with rich cultural and ecological histories. We partnered with over 60 community stakeholders across the state, engaged over 200 youth in herpetological research experiences, and reached thousands of participants in various community events. Our project goals and related accomplishments include:</p>\n<p>1. Enhance herpetology content knowledge and practices designed to foster interest in reptiles and amphibians through interaction with the environment, field ecologists, and herp enthusiasts. In addition to successfully completing each of the four threads of activity, we built a statewide infrastructure to sustain our activities beyond the life of the grant. We partnered with NC organizations and stakeholders that agreed to continue herpetological research experiences for youth, grew and sustained our statewide, citizen science Box Turtle project, and wrote up, shared, and published free resources on our website (described in more detail below under #3). Our work with teachers, through their participation in the herpetological research experiences in summers and through a large workshop of more than 40 teacher participants, provided another way to disseminate design principles and sustain herpetology education in NC.</p>\n<p>2. Enhance participants&rsquo; sense of place and awareness of conservation issues through exposure to personal, cultural, and scientific narratives that involve intergenerational and intercultural communication. NatureChronicles, now archived in Jackson Library at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and available on the HERPS Cyberhub website, provided families and friends opportunities to share, record, and take home audiorecordings of pivotal experiences in the natural world. We also created pedagogical tools to emphasize storytelling with youth of all ages at the community events, such as a puppet show and herp costumes, which are still checked out on a regular basis for community events and festivals. Scripts of puppet shows are available on our website.</p>\n<p>3. Enhance science learning, facilitate communication between scientists, students, and the general public with the HERPS Cyberhub. Our website is an excellent way to disseminate project findings and resources. Sample resources include: links to a HERP Project app that organizes herpetological data collection, Visual Learning software developed by our team that allows citizens to correctly identify herps, and the HERPS curriculum, which will help other informal and formal science educators who aim to facilitate field science with youth. We have also published a book online to help others interested in facilitating or participating in the Box Turtle connection, our citizen science thread of the project.</p>\n<p>4. To study and identify identity-related affordances of HERPS activities for diverse youth with a wide range of science interests and experiences. Our work adds to the growing body of literature linking informal science learning to identity development. Our most significant findings, gathered with quantitative data from surveys and qualitative data through youth interviews immediately following, and then two-five years after their HERPS experiences, illustrate long-term impacts on youths&rsquo; disciplinary identity development. Though identity development has been proposed as a reasonable outcome of well-designed informal science learning spaces, the field has few empirical examples of this. We have developed a theoretical model to study identity longitudinally and methodological ways to map identity work over time. Years after their participation, youth credit the HERP Project with cultivating their science capital, disciplinary agency, and conservationist habits of mind. Youth also note the HERPS&rsquo; impact on career choice, hobbies, views of nature, views of themselves in nature, and/or choices in how they spend their free time. In another study, we outlined design principles for attracting diverse youth to field ecology summer programs, which included leveraging human and natural resources in youths&rsquo; local communities so youth and parents felt comfortable with the novel experience. Youth responded well to HERPS activities because they promoted broader definitions of science and &ldquo;smartness&rdquo; than school science, which increased youths&rsquo; science confidence and affiliation. In another study, we highlighted practices that allowed youth to participate enthusiastically in activities that pushed them out of their comfort zones, including: boundary objects like chest waders helped youth work through fear or discomfort; providing youth time and space to adapt to new environments and field techniques; facilitating social support; and offering scientific and anecdotal knowledge and skills. Our 20+ publications and presentations, curricula for six different field studies and a citizen science protocol for Box Turtles are resources informal science educators interested in field sciences can use in their own work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Heidi&nbsp;B&nbsp;Carlone</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1114558/1114558_10124271_1527647446368_herppics03--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1114558/1114558_10124271_1527647446368_herppics03--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Minnow-traps\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1114558/1114558_10124271_1527647446368_herppics03--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Minnow-traps\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A youth participant in the HERP Project studies a minnow trap set a local ephemeral pool.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Autumn Galloway</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Heidi&nbsp;B&nbsp;Carlone</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Minnow-traps</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1114558/1114558_10124271_1527647630625_Dog-turtle-celebrations--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1114558/1114558_10124271_1527647630625_Dog-turtle-celebrations--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Box-turtle\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1114558/1114558_10124271_1527647630625_Dog-turtle-celebrations--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Box-turtle\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The HERP Project youth learned Box Turtle population studies with the help of Boykin Spaniels with special training to find, and safely retrieve, Box Turtles</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Autumn Galloway</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Heidi&nbsp;B&nbsp;Carlone</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Box-turtle</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
