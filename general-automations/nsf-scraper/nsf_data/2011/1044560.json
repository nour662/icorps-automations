 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Polaris Project II seeks to amplify the impact of Polaris I (now in its third and final year) through its extension, expansion, and enhancement. The three overarching objectives of Polaris II are to 1) train the next generation of arctic researchers, 2) advance scientific understanding of the Arctic, and 3) expand public awareness of the feedbacks between the Arctic and the global climate system. These objectives will be accomplished through a multi-faceted effort that includes a summer field course/research experience in the Siberian Arctic, a series of on-campus arctic-focused courses, and a wide range of outreach activities. While undergraduate students remain the primary focus of Polaris II, participation in the annual field course will be expanded to include a K-12 teacher, graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, and visiting faculty member each year. Outreach activities will target K-12 students and teachers, undergraduate students and faculty, and a diverse public audience. \r\n\r\nThe unifying scientific theme of the Polaris Project is the transport and transformation of carbon and nutrients as they move with water from terrestrial uplands to the Arctic Ocean. Research conducted by the interdisciplinary Polaris Project team of faculty and students will make fundamental contributions to the scientific understanding of this topic, a central issue in arctic system science. While continued scientific advances are essential for arctic system understanding, prediction, and protection, tackling the climate change challenge is also a matter of education. Polaris II offers a unique experience in undergraduate research that will inspire and prepare a new generation of arctic researchers. Further, it will convey the importance of the Arctic to the public and to policy-makers, providing them with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions. \r\n\r\nThe Polaris Project will achieve a broad and lasting impact by linking interdisciplinary scientific research to innovative undergraduate education and imaginative public outreach. In addition to providing a transformative experience for the participants in the annual Siberian field course, Polaris II will educate large numbers of undergraduate students who complete the Polaris-affiliated on-campus courses. The project will also engage K-12 students and teachers through direct and sustained interactions with Polaris PIs and broad dissemination of education and outreach materials. Finally, Polaris II will inform a diverse public audience about the state of the Arctic, ecosystems research, and global climate change. Approaches to project outreach include expansion of the Polaris website and associated blog (www.thepolarisproject.org) and the development of an online seminar series for undergraduates, K-12 teachers, and public participants. The production and wide distribution of multimedia videos addressing key arctic science themes will further expand the reach of the project, as will the inclusion of a writer in the 2011 field course with the objective of publishing a book about the Arctic, climate change, and the Polaris Project experience. As a resource for the scientific and education communities, Polaris data will be freely available through the project website and the Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (CADIS).\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary objectives of this project are to advance scientific understanding of Arctic ecosystems, to engage undergraduate students in authentic research, and to communicate the importance of Arctic science to K-12 students and the general public.  The core activity is an annual summer field course and research expedition to the Northeast Science Station in eastern Siberia.  Since the Polaris Project?s inception in summer 2008, the annual expeditions have included 75 different undergraduate students.  Each student developed a research project within the broad bounds of the Polaris Project?s interest in climate change impacts and feedbacks in the Arctic.  In addition to the first-time participants, 18 undergraduate participants returned for a 2nd expedition and four undergraduates returned as graduate students.  To evaluate the learning outcomes for these students, we conducted extensive and detailed assessment under the direction of our Professional Evaluator, Jo Beld. The results show that participation in the summer field expedition resulted in strong, positive outcomes for these students.  For example, the results from the Arctic Ecosystems Knowledge and Attitudes survey (developed by Beld specifically for Polaris I and II) show clear improvements in both content-based knowledge and understanding of the scientific process. Both quantitative and qualitative evidence show striking gains in their knowledge of Arctic ecosystems and their ability to develop and carry out research projects.  In addition, the Polaris Project has actively recruited participants from historically underrepresented groups and expedition participants have been ethnically, racially, and culturally diverse.  For example, the 2014 expedition included 2 African-Americans, 3 Hispanics, 1 Native American, and 2 Arctic Natives.  Overall more than half of all undergraduate participants were female and most expeditions included students from arctic indigenous groups.\n\nThe Polaris Project has increasingly focused on preparing undergraduate participants for graduate school.  More than 50 Polaris alumni are pursuing or have completed graduate studies including 27 current Ph.D. students, 22 of whom are conducting research with an Arctic focus.  Many of these students are from groups historically underrepresented in Arctic science, including 14 women, 3 of Hispanic origin, and two African Americans.  Polaris alumni have been remarkably successful in securing national graduate fellowships.  To date, seven students have been awarded graduate fellowships: five by NSF, one by NASA, and one by the EPA.  All but two were in support of Arctic research.  The Polaris Project has also supported six postdoctoral researchers, all of whom now hold faculty positions and have subsequently obtained independent grants to continue to conduct research in the Arctic.

Prior to our work, little was known about how ecosystems in the Russian Arctic responded to climate change.  Polaris Project research has added deeper knowledge on a range of questions, from drivers of carbon cycling to the impacts of fire and the activities of small mammals, resulting in 29 journal articles, including nine first-authored by students and another seven with students as co-authors.
