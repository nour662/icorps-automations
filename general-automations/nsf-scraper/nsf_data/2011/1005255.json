An existing but no longer functional spinner magnetometer, for magnetic remanence measurements of strongly magnetized samples (e.g., recent volcanics), will be refurbished, and an aged Kappabridge, for the measurement of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility for petrofabric investigations, will be replaced.   The instruments will support a broad range of paleomagnetic and rock magnetic research that relies on magnetic remanence directional analyses and relative and absolute paleointensity measurements to study the behavior of the Earth's magnetic field and elucidate its physical origin and dynamics and for basic studies of paleogeography of relevance to understanding Earth's plate tectonic motions.   The instruments will support faculty and student research and research training and will remain an open analytical facility for visiting scientists.  \r\n\r\n***",
