Wessler (University of California - Riverside)\r\n\r\nCoPIs: Thomas Brutnell (Boyce Thompson Institute), Jason Stajich (University of California - Riverside) and Qi Sun (Cornell University)\r\n\r\nSenior Personnel:  Joyce Van Eck (Boyce Thompson Institute), James Burnette (University of California - Riverside), Wen-Gui Yan (USDA-ARS Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center) and Yutaka Okumoto (Kyoto University)\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to understand the impact of a rapidly amplifying high copy number transposable element (TE) called mPing on generating diversity in rice. This goal has both applied and basic aspects. The applied goal is to develop and make freely available novel collections of reverse genetic resources that will be characterized from genome to transcriptome to phenome. The basic goal is to analyze for the first time how a high copy TE rapidly diversifies the genome of an organism and, in doing so, alters its ability to respond to a changing environment. It is paradoxical that rice, with the most stable genome among characterized crop plants, is host to the most active TE characterized in any eukaryote.  This fortunate set of circumstances will facilitate the application of next generation sequencing methodologies to sequence related rice cultivars and survey global changes in gene expression associated with abiotic stress responses. To this end the project will resequence five closely related rice strains where mPing has amplified to over 1000 copies during the past century and where it is still actively transposing. Comparison with the closely related reference genome Nipponbare will document for the first time the global impact of independent TE bursts in any organism. To assess the consequences of mPing insertion(s) on quantitative traits, the project will exploit recombinant inbred (RI) populations where the parents vary widely in their copy number of mPing insertions and where significant phenotypic variation exists for many traits.  The contribution of candidate genes with mPing insertions to phenotypic variation will be assayed in transgenic rice. To exploit the full range of mPing amplification, from very low to very high, the project will activate mPing in US cultivars and create up to 1500 lines carrying novel mPing insertions through a non-transgenic approach.  Finally, the project will use expression profiling (RNA-seq) to examine the role of mPing in reshaping the leaf transcriptome in response to abiotic stress.\r\n\r\nThe expected broader impact of the project includes the development of novel collections of non-transgenic mPing-mutagenized rice strains that will be characterized from genome to transcriptome to phenome. All genomics data generated will be deposited at GenBank. Visualization of the datasets will be supported using in-house servers and at Gramene. All biological materials generated during the course of this project will be propagated at the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center in Stuttgart (AR) and seed stocks of non-transgenic materials will be freely distributed through USDA-ARS Genetic Stocks - Oryza (GSOR) Collection. \r\n\r\nAll outreach activities will be channeled through the PI's \"The Dynamic Genome\" courses, which will be taught in a newly constructed Science Learning Facility at the University of California - Riverside.  These courses, which are designed to replicate the PI's research laboratory, will serve as a conduit that integrates the research output of this project with the development of classroom modules for colleges and high schools focused on next generation sequencing methodologies.  As such, these courses will bring the excitement of next-generation technologies to undergraduates and high school students and teachers.  Finally, project involvement in the iPlant Collaborative's Education Outreach Team will facilitate the broader dissemination of successful modules.",

A subset of TEs have attained very high copy numbers with hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands of copies. &nbsp;That TEs can amplify to such high numbers implies that mechanisms exist to insert copies throughout the genome while avoiding silencing and without killing the host. To unravel the mechanisms successful amplification (called a burst), we discovered a very active TE family in domesticated rice (<em>Oryza sativa</em>) composed of the autonomous <em>Ping</em> and nonautonomous <em>mPing</em> elements (Fig. 1). While most characterized rice accessions have 0 to 1 <em>Ping</em> and 1-50 <em>mPing</em>s, the bursting strains have 7-10 <em>Ping</em>s, ~230-500 <em>mPing</em>s, and up to ~40 new <em>mPing</em> insertions per plant/generation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Studies funded by this grant revealed key features of the success of<em> Ping/mPing</em>.&nbsp; First, although <em>mPing</em> prefers to insert in genic regions, it can dramatically increase in copy number with few exon insertions because of its preference for AT rich target sites while rice exons are GC rich. Thus, <em>mPing</em> rarely inserts into rice exons. Second, because <em>mPing</em> is a deletion derivative of <em>Ping</em> that does not share any coding sequences (Fig. 1), host recognition of <em>mPing</em>, as evidenced by <em>mPing</em> methylation and abundance of siRNAs (Fig. 2), does not silence <em>Ping</em> expression because the unmethylated <em>Ping</em> ORFs continue to be transcribed. Our studies determined that despite robust host epigenetic regulation, the bursts have been ongoing for decades and possibly up to a century.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Of interest was also how <em>mPing</em> spreads through a population. While TE bursts are rare phenomena, invasions of na?ve populations by TEs in real time are exceedingly rare, with the most prominent example being the worldwide invasion of <em>Drosophila</em> <em>melanogaster</em> by <em>P</em> elements. We found that like <em>P</em> elements, bursts of <em>mPing</em> occurred during the past century. However, unlike <em>P</em> elements, which have spread throughout the world in less than a century, <em>mPing</em> bursts are restricted to a few related accessions as no bursts were detected in over 3,000 sequenced rice accessions (Fig. 3). This probably reflects the fact that unlike <em>D. melanogaster,</em> which is a wild species and an outcrosser, rice is a domesticated crop that propagates by self- or sib-pollination.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;As proxy for a natural population, we analyzed the spread of <em>mPing</em> through a recombinant inbred population where one parent was the reference Nipponbare and the other was HEG4, one of the bursting accessions (Fig. 4). Sequencing of the entire population demonstrated that the <em>mPing</em> burst generates functionally relevant genomic variations upon which selection can act. In addition to over 14,000 new <em>mPing</em> insertions, continued <em>mPing</em> amplification increases the number of tightly linked elements that, in turn, increases the frequency of structural variations (Fig. 5) where the majority of those detected appear to be derived from aberrant transposition events with <em>mPing</em> at one or both breakpoints (Fig. 6). The significance of this finding is that it provides a TE-mediated mechanism that may generate much of the structural variation represented by pan-genomes in plants and other organisms.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this project were channeled through the Dynamic Genome laboratory course (BIOL20) at UC Riverside where almost 600 first year students participated in authentic research projects that derive from this grant and from the research of other UCR faculty members.&nbsp; In addition to improving student success in the companion Intro Bio lecture course, BIOL20 provides a pathway for entering STEM majors to become familiar with research laboratories, and the meaning of a Research University early in their undergraduate experience.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/03/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Susan&nbsp;R&nbsp;Wessler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1027542/1027542_10077407_1622743035166_ScreenShot2021-06-03at10.54.21AM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1027542/1027542_10077407_1622743035166_ScreenShot2021-06-03at10.54.21AM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 1: Structure of the Ping and mPing elements\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1027542/1027542_10077407_1622743035166_ScreenShot2021-06-03at10.54.21AM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 1: Structure of the Ping and mPing elements\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">mPing is a deletion derivative of the autonomous Ping element.

In addition to improving student success in the companion Intro Bio lecture course, BIOL20 provides a pathway for entering STEM majors to become familiar with research laboratories, and the meaning of a Research University early in their undergraduate experience. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susan R Wessler"
