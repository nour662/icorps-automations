 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the fundamental challenges of modeling, analysis and computation for nonlinear models in applied sciences involving hyperbolic balance laws, kinetic models, and mixtures of simple and complex fluids. The project has two primary components:  \r\n(a) The investigation of complex flows with emphasis on fluid-particle interaction models and polymeric fluids. Issues to be addressed include large-data existence theory for physical systems, issues of stability and asymptotic analysis, hydrodynamic and diffusive limits as well as aspects of regularity. \r\n(b)  The investigation of multidimensional systems with focus on hyperbolic systems of conservation laws and models of compressible fluids with dispersive effects. Issues to be addressed include large-data well-posedness theory for physical systems, the investigation of the structure of solutions as well as the analysis of singular limits.\r\n\r\nAdvances in this interdisciplinary research will rely substantially on the development of new analytical techniques in nonlinear partial differential equations. Analytical and numerical methods in this field have developed together; analytical understanding contributes to the construction of accurate and efficient numerical schemes, while numerical experiments often lead the theoretical analysis. Progress in this research program will contribute to the successful investigation of a wide variety of important physical systems arising in biology and materials science as well as to the design of high performance computational algorithms.  Furthermore, this project will contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by providing mentoring and advanced training for young researchers and by organizing a framework for interdisciplinary interactions with researchers from related fields.",

Historically, sharp decay rates have been able to provide quantitative information} on the solutions only in the scalar case. By quantitative information here it is meant: results on uniqueness, regularity and convergence rates.\nFor system of hyperbolic conservation laws the earlier results on decay estimates  were able to provide only  qualitatively information on the solutions.   By qualitatively information here it is meant: a way to visualize the behavior and decay of waves associated with a solution but without further information on issues relevant to uniqueness, regularity, or precise rates of convergence.   The sharp decay result presented in the work of the PI   relates the measure that corresponds to  the solution of the system of hyperbolic balance laws to the measure that corresponds to the solution of the  Burgers' (scalar) equation  with impulsive source term and shows that the latter is in fact more singular. This comparison estimate is extremely meaningful because it enables us to obtain powerful results for systems of hyperbolic balance laws that were previously unattainable. One such result is the establishment of rate of convergence of vanishing viscosity approximations.\n\nMultiphase flows\n\nThe next part of this activity involves the investigation of hydrodynamic models. The objective of this research activity is the  investigation and mathematical analysis of a wide spectrum of physical systems in compressible fluids, nonlinear materials sciences, biological sciences, medicine and other applied areas. The systems under investigation are governed by the Navier--Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates and related models.\n\nFluid-particle interaction \n\nThis research activity  deals with the issues of global-in-time existence, stability and asymptotic analysis of a fluid-particle interaction  model  in the bubbling regime.   The system under investigation describes the evolution of particles dispersed in a viscous compressible fluid and is expressed by the conservation of  fluid mass, the balance of momentum and the balance of particle density often referred as the Smolukowski equation.\\fiThe analytical results have been produced in collaboration with Trygve Karper and Jose Carrillo.The analysis covers both bounded and unbounded domains.

Doi and Edwards). The orientation distribution of the rods on the microscopic level is described by a Fokker-Planck-type equation on the sphere, while the  fluid  flow is given by the Navier-Stokes equations,which are now enhanced by an additional macroscopic stress reflecting the orientation of therods on the molecular level.
