 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vital importance of gaining a better understanding of seismic (earthquake) and volcanic hazards and risks related to the process of subduction was dramatically underscored by the recent megathrust earthquake in Japan, and its catastrophic consequences. A heavily populated region of North America that is subject to similarly conditions is Cascadia, which extends from southern British Columbia to northernmost California. The Cascadia Initiative (CI) is an onshore/offshore seismic and geodetic experiment that will deploy an array of seismometers on the seafloor to complement an array of stations onshore, with the aim of addressing questions ranging from megathrust earthquakes to volcanic arc structure to the formation, deformation and hydration of the Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates. These diverse targets are components of the overall subduction zone system and require an array of seismometers crosses the shoreline and encompasses relevant plate boundaries. The experimental design and objectives, specified at meeting held in Portland, Oregon in 2010, are described in the NSF Cascadia Initiative Workshop Report, which spells out the scientific objectives of the CI, the resources involved and the community-defined OBS deployment plan. This award will support a team of scientists tocaary out and oversee the first year of CI OBS deployments (summer 2011), the planning and operational efforts of the Cascadia Initiative Expedition Team (CIET) and the initial Education and Outreach (E&O) effort. \r\n\r\nThe chief broader impact of the Cascadia Initiative is its very high societal relevance. Achieving a better understanding of seismicity and volcanism in regions such as Cascadia is key to mitigating risks and planning for the potentially devastating effects of volcanic eruptions and great earthquakes. This proposal includes important outreach and education activities as well. The CIET Education and Outreach program will develop two opportunities during the first year. First, the 'CC@sea' project will support community college ('CC') student participation in OBS deployment, retrieval and pre-cruise and follow-up outreach activities in CCs, high schools and the community. The second Cascadia Initiative E&O program develops activities in high school classrooms in Oregon (initially), Washington and northern California.",
