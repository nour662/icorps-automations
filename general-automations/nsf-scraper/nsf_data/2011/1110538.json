 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several mechanisms are known for generating new species, but studying these processes in the ocean is much more difficult than on land because such processes are frequently not apparent.  The work presented here aims to better understand how the movement and changing shape of continents and oceans affect living organisms over time.  The Gulf of California is only about 6 million years old and is separated from the Pacific Ocean by the Baja California peninsula.  This work examines how fishes originally colonized the Gulf, whether in the past a seaway once connected presently separated populations, and whether currently separated fish populations are becoming different species today.  First, their DNA is studied to reveal the relationships between these populations and reveal their past migratory events.  Second, the rocks on the peninsula are examined because they reflect the region?s past environment and would indicate whether or not some of the land was under water in the past.  \r\n\r\nFormation of new species is a principle contributor to biodiversity across the world, and Baja California has a greater number and diversity of species than expected from its size and location alone.  The size, location, and climatic characteristics of estuarine habitat are always changing, but on too long a timescale for scientists to observe.  This molecular work will help understand what processes have generated and are maintaining southern and Baja California?s diverse estuarine life.  Disseminating information from this work to high school and undergraduate students (through mentorships) and to residents (through educational YouTube videos) promotes conservation awareness.  Working with authorities like the NFWS and NERRS helps focus conservation efforts not only on regions that are diverse today, but that are likely to preserve and generate new species in the future.\r\n",
