 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project relies on extensive knowledge of the basic biology of Arabidopsis to understand how plants adapt to climate. Integrated analyses of the genetics of developmental timing, architectural allocation, photosynthetic water use efficiency, growth, and reproductive yield will be compared among plants raised under conditions that mimic a climate gradient associated with altitude in the native range of the species. Because the exact locations of natural populations are known, adaptations of plants raised in the laboratory can be compared directly with native environmental conditions, where temperature and moisture govern plant survival and seed yield. Growth curve analysis will be used to account for plant yields (fitness), while also testing the major intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing plant growth and yield. Growth curve analyses developed by this project can be easily adapted to other systems. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the biological underpinnings of plant adaptation to climate is critically important for breeding crops and understanding natural diversity. This basic research will have broad impacts; the same genes that control development and physiology in Arabidopsis function in all plants. This research will contribute to education at multiple levels as well as to recruitment to careers in science. The project includes collaboration with two non-profits to provide a summer science camp for primarily African-American middle school students from underserved schools in the area.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAcross climate regions, plants show a remarkable array of coping mechanisms that adapt them to the stresses imposed by their local climates.  Which of the tens of thousands of genes in a plant are responsible for those adaptations, and how do the genes have their effect on the plant's form and function (i.e. the plant phenotype)?  In this study, we studied a set of populations in northeastern Spain to ask how plants adapt to changing climates.  Our ultimate goal is three-fold.  First, the system we developed can be used to understand the adaptive evolutionary process itself.  This is basic scientific knowledge that will prove useful in many future investigations.  Second, this system can be used to identify specific changes in genes and gen expression that will be useful for breeding crops for future climates.  Third, this study will help to understand how natural plant species will respond to future climates, and important conservation concern.\n\n \n\nOur study populations in northeastern Spain are descended from a common ancestral population that dispersed out of southern Spain at the end of the last ice age and populated northeastern Spain, from the Mediterranean shore westward into the high Pyrenee mountains near Pamplona. \n\n \n\nWe collected 64 genetic lines in along an elevation and climate gradient in this region.  We also collected more than a million temperature readings year-round at 16 sampling stations.  In controlled environment chambers at the University of Pittsburgh, we simulated the year-round climate cycles from the field sites and measured plan responses.  We also measured plant responses to extremes of cold and heat.\n\n \n\nThe genetic lines showed strong clinal divergence along the climate gradient.  Plants from the lowest sites experience much more rapid warming and drying in the spring.  Compared to genetic lines from the high elevation sites they grow faster, flower and senesce earlier.  They have steeper leaf angles, reducing the amount of heat loading from sunlight.  They are more tolerant of high temperatures, showing no significant reduction in photosynthetic rate at 45oC compared to the rate at 22oC. High elevation lines lose the ability to photosynthesize at 45oC, but use evaporation of water from their leaves to cool their leaves an average of 8.6oC below ambient air temperature.  Thus, low elevation plants are more tolerant of high temperature in part because they maintain high levels of stress response chemicals all the time, while high elevation plants respond with avoidance of high temperatures through plastic physiological responses.  This evolved difference is in part the result of differences in water availability.  High elevation plants have more soil water available for use in cooling their leaves.  In addition to these measurable aspects of plant form and function (here only the highlights have been mentioned- more detail is given in a series of published reports), we measured the patterns of change in gene expression under heat stress, using comparative full transcriptome analysis.\n\n \n\nHigh elevation plants are much more plastic in gene expression when exposed to high temperature, explaining the greater plasticity in physiology we observed.  In particular, they show up-regulation of many more heat shock factors than the low elevation plants.  These heat shock factors govern the expression of heat shock proteins that are in tun responsible for maintaining integrity of cellular processes and repair of heat-damage proteins.  We followed the transcriptome analysis with complete genome sequencing of the genetic lines used in this study.  Early results show us divergent DNA sequences between the genetic lines collected at the two ends of the gradient in a number of regions of the genome.  Most notable, differences were observed in the sequences of key stress response genes in the DREB family of transcription factors.\n\n \n\nThe full genome sequences for all the genetic lines will soon be uploaded to t..."
