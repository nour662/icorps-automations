 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores any spatial and temporal changes in precipitation over the Holocene (last 10,000 years) across the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) from hydrologic records generated from speleothems from Guam, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and the Philippines. The overall goal of the research is to determine if the tropical Pacific played an active or passive role in driving the changes in the global hydrological cycle over the Holocene.\r\n\r\nThe research questions being pursued include: Did insolation forcing directly cause meridional changes associated with the monsoon and InterTropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the WPWP over the Holocene? Did external insolation forcing induce internal changes in the tropical Pacific via zonal changes, or ENSO, to cause precipitation changes in the WPWP over the Holocene?\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives of the project include: 1) measuring Uranium-series ages and oxygen isotopic composition of speleothem samples from Guam, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and the Philippines for the last 10,000 years at decadal-scale resolution; 2) determining the spatial and temporal hydrologic variability across the WPWP for the last 10,000 years by comparing paleoclimate records from sites that experience different climate dynamics to separate the influence of ENSO dynamics and monsoon dynamics on WPWP; and 3) returning to the sites in the WPWP to collect additional speleothems, cave dripwaters, bedrock and soils to ensure that we accurately interpret the speleothem records\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts involve linking paleoclimate reconstructions with hydrologic studies.  This provides potential benefits for regional and local water resources management.  The project would also support a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin and a M.S. student at the University of Guam.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGuam is a living laboratory for climate research in a pivotal part of the planet\u00c6s climate system.  In particular, Guam\u00c6s location on the edge of the West Pacific Warm Pool uniquely positions it for informative research on phenomena of global impact, such as El Ni&ntilde;o and Pacific Decadal Oscillations, along with phenomena of regional and local importance, including typhoon origins, behaviors, and characteristics; rainfall and drought cycles; and sea-level variability.  Moreover, since these mechanisms also control drinking water supplies&mdash;both surface and groundwater&mdash;for Guam and other islands in the region, water resource managers and policy-makers are already looking to local climate scientists for advice on management of water supplies, including response to storms and droughts.\n\n \n\nUOG researchers and their colleagues at the University of Texas-Austin are collecting and analyzing a broad suite of geochemical data&mdash;in particular, stable isotopes from rainwater collectors, groundwater production wells, and cave drip waters.  Water isotopes are powerful natural tracers for monitoring and understanding hydrologic processes on global to local scales.  The chemical signatures of isotopes in rainwater, for example, can reveal where a given water mass originated in the Pacific Ocean and what processes it has undergone on its path.  One can also use water isotopes to understand crucial hydrogeologic processes, such as groundwater recharge.  Such data can answer critical questions about the fate of storm water, such as whether it contributes to aquifer recharge or merely run off the lens to the ocean.  Work to date has already shown, for example, from comparing rainwater with subsequent cave drip-waters, that rainfall arriving on Guam during Guam\u00c6s dry seasons&mdash;about one-third of the annual total&mdash;does not show up in the percolating water that recharges Guam\u00c6s groundwater lens.  Well water analyses are reinforcing this finding.  Such understanding is crucial for predicting effects of climate shifts on the drinking water resources of Guam and similar islands.  Other related hydrogeologic research leveraged by this project includes another NSF-sponsored collaborative project with the University of South Florida, in which UOG researchers are locating and collecting carbon dioxide samples from wells in Guam\u00c6s aquifer to better understand the processes by which water pathways develop in island karst aquifers. \n\n \n\nDuring the current El Ni&ntilde;o, weekly samples of rain water at the University of Guam are being analyzed for water isotopes by collaborating scientists at UT Austin.   To our knowledge this is the only established collection program for rainwater isotopes in the western Pacific Ocean.   The sampling also includes groundwater samples from drinking water production wells, which is part of a related concurrent project, funded by the Strategic Research and Development Program, led by the USGS\u00c6s Pacific Island Water Science Center (PIWSC), in collaboration with UOG, the University of Texas-Austin, and the University of Hawaii-Manoa.

This work will provide a basis for forecasting the effects of changes in climatic cycles and sea level on Guam\u00c6s groundwater availability and quality.  \n\n \n\nWork to date on the reconstruction of past climate on Guam from this project has so far shown that Guam has experienced substantial decadal-scale wet-dry periods, within a general increase in rainfall (of about 30 inches) over at least the past 160 years.  Pre-instrumental wet-dry cycles appear to have been of larger magnitude than the subsequent recent cycles.  Besides providing local water resource managers and policy-makers with an understanding of where long-term trends might..."
