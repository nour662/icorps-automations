 "awd_abstract_narration": "The innumerable cells in the brain form countless numbers of connections (synapses) with each other.  These synapses act as gatekeepers for the transmission of electrical signals through neural circuits, which underlie behavior.  Recent studies have focused on mechanisms that maintain constant synaptic function (synaptic homeostasis) throughout an animal's life; these mechanisms are essential for maintaining the normal function of the brain. The proposed research will examine the induction and expression of synaptic homeostasis.  Our preliminary findings provide the first direct evidence that intracellular calcium triggers synaptic homeostasis; the role of calcium will be further explored in this research.  In addition, we have identified a membrane channel activated by calcium that appears to be important in the expression of synaptic homeostasis.  The proposed experiments will further define the properties of this novel mechanism and its role in synaptic homeostasis.  These studies will utilize transgenic techniques, imaging of fluorescent indicators, biochemistry, and electrophysiology.  Experiments will be performed using the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction, which is one of the preferred model systems for synaptic studies since these synapses are identifiable, accessible and amenable to genetic manipulations.  The findings of this basic research will advance our knowledge of synaptic homeostasis and should be applicable to the nervous systems of all animals including humans.  These results will be widely disseminated through attendance at international meetings and publications in international journals.  The research projects will involve undergraduate students including underrepresented minority students; this will provide an entry point for these students to pursue careers in scientific research and teaching.  In addition, the proposal will fund the research of graduate students pursuing advanced degrees in the Biological Sciences.  Finally, the theory and results of this research will be communicated to students in two Neuroscience lecture courses and the experimental techniques are incorporated in a Neuroscience laboratory course.",

Studies in the central nervous system (CNS) revealed another mechanism for synapse strengthening: increased postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter triggered by an increase in postsynaptic Ca. This form of synaptic plasticity appears to play a direct role in learning and memory.  It has been extensively studied but progress has been slow due to the difficulty in studying brain synapses.  Our studies have demonstrated that this synapse strengthening can be studied at the NMJ where progress should be much more rapid.  In addition, we have found that postsynaptic Ca also plays an important role in synaptic homeostasis at the NMJ \n\n            Our studies have shown that increasing postsynaptic Ca at the Drosophila larval NMJ produces a rapid reduction in synaptic strength through the activation of a Ca-dependent K+ channel (SK channel).  In our model, this negative feedback on synaptic strength would act to fine-tune the synapse and contribute to synaptic homeostasis.  This is a novel mechanism for synaptic homeostasis, which involves only a single postsynaptic channel and is very simple compared to the current model involving the retrograde regulation of transmitter release. This finding may apply generally to synapses since the SK channel is found on dendrites in the mammalian CNS where it functions to resist synaptic changes and learning.  In addition, we have demonstrated a form of activity-dependent synaptic strengthening where an increase in postsynaptic Ca leads to greater postsynaptic sensitivity to the neurotransmitter, glutamate.  This is a new finding for the NMJ and it has many properties in common with synapse strengthening seen in the CNS.  Together our findings demonstrate a dual role for postsynaptic Ca; it produces synaptic homeostasis and synaptic strengthening at the same synapse.  Our current model is that lower Ca levels produce a short-term mechanism for synaptic homeostasis and higher Ca levels trigger longer-lasting synapse strengthening.\n\n            This research identified a novel mechanisms for activity-dependent synapse strengthening and homeostasis at the much-studied NMJ. These mechanisms for synapse strengthening and homeostasis can be examined at these accessible and simple neuromuscular synapses.
