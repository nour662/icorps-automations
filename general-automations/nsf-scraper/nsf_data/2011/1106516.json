 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research concerns novel statistical theory, models and methods for structured dynamic and spatio-dynamic multivariate processes. The scope includes theoretical developments of new classes of stochastic process models for dynamic covariancestructures in multi- and matrix-variate time series, including novel classes of stationary Markov processes for multivariate volatility modeling. Theoretical and applied developments include new approaches to sparsity modeling for increasingly high-dimensional, time-varying parameter stochastic systems, applying to dynamic regression, time-varying vector auto-regression, dynamic factor models and covariance volatility models. Additional research focuses on new classes of spatial lattice and spatially-varying random field models, coupled with time series processes to define flexible models of spatio-temporal models for increasingly high-resolution lattice data observed through time. The investigator develops Bayesian simulation-based statistical computation-- including GPU-based parallelized algorithms-- for model implementations, and cross-disciplinary applications in financial time series as well as studies in atmospheric and biomedical sciences.\r\n\r\nFaced with increasingly high-dimensional data sets generated in studies of temporal and spatial systems, statistical science research aims to substantially advance the ability to represent, analyze and use mathematical models of increasing dimension, realism and complexity. The investigator develops mathematical and statistical modelling theory and associated simulation-based computational methods for a range of contexts, motivated in part by collaborative cross-disciplinary applications in areas of finance, atmospheric science and the neurosciences. Innovations in statistical research include: (i) new and improved models for describing and predicting change in time of the complex patterns of relationships among several or many time series-- such as financial indicators, or nano-technology based recordings of neural signals in brain imaging; (ii) new theory and methods for inducing sparsity-- i.e., controlling complexity-- of applied stochastic models, to enable scaling to increasingly high-dimensional problems, such as arise in  high-resolution satellite imaging in atmospheric studies as well as large-scale financial time series;(iii) innovations in simulation techniques for statistical computing, including parallel desktop computing, to advance the ability to fit, explore and use models of increasing scale and complexity and with increasingly large data sets. With cross-disciplinary collaborators and students, the research advances core mathematical and statistical modeling theory and technology, and contributes new, refined and relevant approaches to modeling and dataanalysis in several specific applied contexts as well as generating methods for broader use.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nProblems of formal, accurate and reliable statistical analysis\nof increasingly high-dimensional, complex data measured or\nobserved over time require new quantitative methods and\nmathematical models as well as computational techniques\nthat can operate fast and effectively. This research has\naddressed these general issues in a number of specific\ncontexts, developing new and refined statistical methods--\nbased on new concepts and then coupled with advanced\ncomputational ideas, including parallel computing-- resulting\nin improved and new statistical methods that are of broad\nuse for future studies in many fields. Specific applied problems\nin areas including macro-economics, finance, atmospheric\nsciences and neuroscience have defined case studies to\nshowcase the abilities of the new statistical models and\nmethods, as well as evidencing advances in understanding\nof the applied science problems based on these new, refined\nstatistical analyses of time series data sets.\n \nA core theme in this research has been the concept of\nstatistical sparsity -- that is, mathematical models and\naccompanying statistical algorithms for complex data\nsets that are able to scale to the kinds of data sets we\nare increasingly faced with. Building on several new such\nconcepts, this research has defined new models that are\nable to automatically reduce or expand model complexity\nadaptively, and dynamically in time, as data evolve. Other\naspects of the application of sparsity concepts in dynamic\ntime series environments have defined an ability to build\nlarge models of very many time series measured\nsimultaneously by decoupling their analyses in parallel, and\nusing novel statistical concepts to properly recouple for\nformal resulting inferences, forecasting and input to\ndecision analyses.\n \nAmong several additional themes in this research have\nbeen extensions of such modeling ideas to dynamic\nprocesses observed over spatial regions, where sparsity\nmodeling of complex, and increasingly high-dimensional\ndata sets are critical. Finally, the research has linked into\nhigh-dimensional data analysis in other contexts where time\nis not an issue, but scale and complexity of data is central.\n \nCollaborations with disciplinary scientists and junior\nresearchers at all levels (students, and postdoctoral researchers)\nhave been central in motivating new theory and methods research.\n \nSignificant applications and advances have been made in\nseveral areas: in applied forecasting in macroeconomic policy\ntime series studies; in financial time series and portfolio decision\nanalysis; in dynamic network analysis in studies of brain connectivity\ndata from complex neuroscience time series; in cellular\nsystems biology based on high-resolution spatial-temporal imaging\ndata sets; in atmospheric chemistry studies of integrating physical\ncomputer model simulation-forecasts of low-level atmospheric CO\nfluxes from ground-level sources with high-resolution satellite imagery\ndata sets, and others.\n \nGraduate students and postdoctoral researchers engaged in this\nresearch-- directly and through collaborators-- have gained experience\nin both statistical disciplinary research methods as well as in\ncollaborations across disciplinary boundaries. Aspects of the research\nhave impacted-- both formally through course material, examples, etc.,\nand informally-- on undergraduate and graduate teaching on topics\nrelated to multivariate statistical modeling, high-dimensional data,\nand dynamic/time series areas, and more broadly through multiple\nshort-courses presented by the PI over the course of the research,\nas well as via many oral presentations, publications, and web-based\ndissemination that includes software for all new models and methods.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/01/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mike West"
