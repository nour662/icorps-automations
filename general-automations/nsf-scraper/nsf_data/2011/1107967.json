For a case of 26,000 aerosol particles, I have demonstrated significant speedup from nearly 5 hours on a single CPU to 21 minutes on a single Nvidia GTX 560Ti GPU and continue to work on optimizing the performance. I have also participated in several outreach opportunities since returning from Taiwan. Our research group has hosted several visiting groups where I have contributed presentations of the research I completed while in Taiwan. The sample AR code provides one of the most intriguing demonstration products for visitors. Our engineering advisory board, new faculty candidates, and students in a graduate CFD course have bee..."
