 "awd_abstract_narration": "In spite of the urgent need for better tools, automated, in situ methods for the determination of the presence, abundance and activity of marine microbes are still in the development stages. The Capillary Waveguide Biosensor (CWB) will potentially make possible long-term, in situ, unattended detection of microorganisms and monitoring of microbial processes. This is a renewal of the PI?s EAGER proposal. They were able to complete two of the three tasks originally proposed. With this addition funding they will complete the third task, which was to optimize hybridization protocols and achieve a dynamic range satisfactory for use in real-world studies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe potential for training students at graduate, undergraduate and high school levels in this project is particularly interesting and exciting, because it will offer students the opportunities to cross-train in microbial ecology and engineering. Also, education and training of minorities and exposure of the general public to science are two other likely benefits of this project. Participation of C-MORE students is great. If molecular techniques are going to be used more frequently in the future, students are going to have to get used to the technology.\r\n",

Over the last two years, design of a temperature microcontroller and electronic and optical data acquisition system were perfected allowing for an efficient merging of the CWB with the MFB.\n\n \n\nThe heart of the CWB is a capillary with an interior coating of capture probe molecules designed to bind targeted RNA or DNA.  Coating protocols were developed to ensure that the probe layer was uniform and effective.  This allowed for major improvements in the magnitude and uniformity of the fluorescent signal, and guaranteed that the probes remained firmly attached to the capillary interior and could be regenerated for repeated use.  Our work to date is essential to making the CWB a reliable platform to work with environmental samples, where concentrations of microorganisms can be variable and the target organism may be only a small proportion of the total microbial numbers.
