 "awd_abstract_narration": "Purdue University and CERIAS propose to host three new cohorts of Scholarship for Service (SFS) graduate students. The project builds on the established programs in cybersecurity education and research, and a successful experience as one of the first SFS recipients. The program expects a total of 18 new graduates with an M.S. degree, either in Computer Science or in the Interdisciplinary Masters Degree in Information Security. Some of those graduates may also complete qualifier exams to return to Purdue for a Ph.D. in computer science. The project has an interdisciplinary approach and demonstrates how cybersecurity is more than a technical domain of expertise, but one that must include background in issues related to individual and group behaviors. The SFS students participate in research at the boundaries of these issues as part of their required M.S. thesis or research project.  Students receive special attention in seminar and advising sessions to help them understand the context and role of information security in today's society. This includes regular presentations by leaders in commerce, academia, and government. Through this program students receive a valuable educational background in information security and assurance, obtain hands-on research experience, gain perspective on industry and research trends, and provide valuable service to the government while experiencing real-world problems.",
