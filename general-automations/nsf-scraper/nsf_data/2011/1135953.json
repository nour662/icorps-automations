 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computing landscape is a richly-heterogeneous space including both fixed and mobile nodes with a large variety of sensing, actuation and computational capabilities (including mobile devices, home electronics, taxis, robotic drones, etc.).  Cyber-physical applications built on these devices have the potential to gather data on, analyze, and adapt to or control a range of environments.  The challenge, however, is that Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are difficult to program, and even more difficult to incorporate from one deployment to another, or to dynamically manage as nodes availability changes.  Thus, CPS applications are too often programmed in a brittle fashion that impedes their ability to efficiently use available compute/sense/actuate resources beyond a one-shot deployment. In response, this project is improving CPS design and control in four primary thrusts. First, the project is developing CPSISA, an abstraction layer or intermediate representation to facilitate CPS applications expressing their compute/sense/actuate requirements to lower-level mapping and management layers. Second, the project is exploring methods of providing a Device Attribute Catalog (DAC) that summarizes a region?s available CPS nodes and their capabilities. Third, this research is improving and exploiting the ability to model, predict, and control the mobility of CPS nodes. When some CPS nodes are mobile, the accuracy and performance of a CPS application fundamentally is a function of where nodes will be positioned at any moment in time.  This work exploits both static statistical coverage analysis and dynamic prediction and interpolation. Fourth, using CPSISA, DAC, and other resources as input, the team is developing tools to statically or dynamically optimize mappings of CPS applications onto available resources. To test ideas in a detailed and concrete manner, two applications are being studied and deployed.  First, the FireGuide application for emergency response assistance uses groups of mobile/robotic nodes for guiding first responders in building fires.  Second, a Regional Traffic Management (RTM) application demonstrates ideas at the regional level and will explore CPS scenarios for automobile traffic sensing and dynamic toll pricing.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research program has the potential for broad societal impact.  Studies that improve how building emergencies are handled will improve emergency response safety both for occupants and for first responders around the country.  Likewise, the deployment plans regarding regional traffic management will improve traffic patterns, fuel efficiency and quality-of-life for commuters across the United States. The research team is distributing the CPSISA, CPSMap, and CPSDyn software frameworks to allow other researchers and developers to make use of them. Extensive industry collaborations foster effective technology transfer. Finally, the project continues and broadens the PIs? prior track records for undergraduate research advising and for mentoring women students and members of under-represented minority groups.",

Smartphones and laptops allow people to work and interact from nearly anywhere at nearly any time.&nbsp; Furthermore, the emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices imbues everyday objects with computing and communications capabilities that support broad collection, analysis and adaptation to data about our surroundings.&nbsp; The resulting computing landscape is a richly-heterogeneous space of Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs).&nbsp; These include both fixed and mobile computational ``nodes&rsquo;&rsquo; with a large variety of sensing, control, computational and communication/networking capabilities. Such nodes might include smartphones, laptops, and home electronics, but also industrial control systems, taxis, robotic drones, and more. The challenge, however, is that CPSs are difficult to program, and once programmed, that code is even more difficult to port from one deployment to another, or to dynamically manage as the usage context changes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> This project studied methods for building programmable, portable, and environmentally-adaptive mobile systems.&nbsp; Three key results are highlighted below.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">First, we demonstrate the use of both open data (e.g. census records) and commercial data (e.g. cellphone call detail records or CDRs) for region-scale human mobility modeling.&nbsp; The work demonstrated methods for identifying important recurring locations in individual movement patterns and for applying semantic information to such locations (e.g. discerning home and work locations from unlabeled mobility information).&nbsp; Such approaches can be used to guide urban planning studies regarding transportation and residential needs.&nbsp; We further elaborated on these techniques by employing rigorous &ldquo;differential privacy&rdquo; approaches to be able to use aggregated CDR-based models without individualized movement patterns being revealed in any way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Second, we explored dynamically adaptive methods for reducing mobile data traffic by &ldquo;offloading&rdquo; from cellular to WiFi.&nbsp; Worldwide, mobile data usage has been increasing dramatically, and as a result, users data usage costs increase. Mobile data offloading to WiFi where available can greatly decrease the usage of cellular data networks and reduce users data usage costs. Challenges arise, however, in planning how and when to exploit WiFi versus cellular connectivity. This work developed optimal and heuristic scheduling frameworks to exploit delay-tolerant WiFi offloading. From smartphone prototyping, the results show that delay-tolerant techniques average more than 2X reduction in cellular data usage, and for some scenarios, the reduction is as high as 5X. Overall, the work offers insights for real-world implementations of such offloading solutions by prototyping practical connectivity optimizers, and considering a range of design alternatives.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Third, we demonstrated techniques---again dynamic and adaptive---for reducing mobile data traffic through selective compression techniques.&nbsp; To reduce web traffic, save energy, and make network transfers for mobile edge devices faster, compression is commonly used today. However, compression can hurt performance if it is not used judiciously. Our work developed framework that improves the performance of network transfers in wireless mobile networks by selectively applying compression only when predicted to have a useful payoff. To guide the compression decision, Locomotive uses statistical model to dynamically estimate characteristics regarding the data being transferred and the current network conditions.&nbsp; Our framework improves performance by roughly 10-25%, while also reducing data usage by 30% or more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> Our work has offered practical techniques for use by mobile service operators and device designers.&nbsp; In addition, our techniques for urban-scale mobility modeling are freely available via our publications.&nbsp; Our demonstration of how to use public data (e.g. census data) for such modeling means that these techniques are truly broadly accessible for all to employ.&nbsp; From a workforce development standpoint, this research resulted in the training of several outstanding engineers who are now at work in both industry and academia.&nbsp; Follow-on work has resulted in commercial uptake of our ideas and techniques.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/22/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Margaret&nbsp;Martonosi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1135953/1135953_10127732_1482443869710_Slide4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1135953/1135953_10127732_1482443869710_Slide4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Region-Scale Mobility Characterizations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1135953/1135953_10127732_1482443869710_Slide4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Region-Scale Mobility Characterizations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Models based on anonymized and privacy-preserved aggregations of cellphone usage information can be built to model dynamic population densities across a region.
