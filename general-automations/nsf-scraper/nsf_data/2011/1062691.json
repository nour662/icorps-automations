 "awd_abstract_narration": "Penn State University continues operation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates/Teachers Site hosted by the Penn State Department of Physics and the Penn State Materials Research Science and Engineering Center. Nineteen undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds are recruited every year for a ten-week summer research experience. Five teachers are supported every year for a six-week summer research experience.\r\n\r\nScience teachers and students majoring in science and engineering disciplines participate in a variety of research projects in condensed matter and materials research within laboratories located in science and engineering departments at Penn State. Working with top researchers and their groups on individual research projects, students receive training and information, which prepares them for the excitement and challenges of graduate school. Teachers transfer material science knowledge to classroom activities by developing appropriate resources with their peers and Penn State faculty. Participants attend weekly professional development seminars, weekly research seminars, ethic training, machine shop courses, facility tours, a trip to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, and present the results of their research at a symposium.",
