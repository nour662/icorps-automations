 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide 26 scholarships annually for four years to low-income undergraduates in science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, and environmental science majors. The primary goal of the program is to increase the number of talented but financially disadvantaged residents of the region to achieve higher education degrees in STEM programs. This project will focus on the recruitment and retention of these students to degree achievement.  It builds upon a comprehensive infrastructure for mentoring students and providing intensive, continuous intervention strategies. The active participation of business and industry partners will enhance internship/research opportunities, as well as facilitate placements in the high technology industry. The project aims to provide academic support services to ensure 80% achieve an average GPA of 3.0 each semester; to graduate 80% of S-STEM students in the top 30% of their graduating class; and to achieve an 80% success rate in the number of transfer program participants who obtain admittance to a senior institution or obtain job placement within 12 months of graduation.  The project will benefit the Southwest Virginia region which faces substantial economic challenges and is forced to change its economic base.   It seeks to meet the demand for graduates in fields such as engineering and informatics which will be critical to developing a New Economy for the region.",

The program provided scholarships annually for five years to low-income undergraduates in science, engineering, and electrical electronics majors.  The grant was originally funded for a four year period; however, a fifth year no-cost extension was approved. The extension provided recipients who were selected in the final year of the program with scholarships for two years. The primary goal of the scholarship program was to increase the number of talented but financially disadvantaged residents of the region who achieve higher education degrees in STEM programs.  This project focused on the recruitment and retention of these students to degree achievement.\n\nListed below are each of the four (4) primary project objectives and the outcomes achieved.\n\nObjective:  To increase by 26 students each year (or 104 students), the number of talented, financially disadvantaged students, with emphasis on low income, rural, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities entering the field of science, engineering technology, or mathematics to receive scholarships from this program.\n\n\n \n\nOutcomes: The goal of increasing by 104, the number of students receiving scholarships was met and exceeded. 28 students received scholarships in YR1; 26 students in YR2; 27 students in YR 3; 34 students in YR4; and 18 students in YR5 (carried over from YR4).  Therefore, the total number of students receiving scholarships was 115.\n\n \n\nObjectives:  To provide academic support services to 100% of participants to help ensure 80% achieve an average GPA of 3.0 each semester.\n\n\n \n\nOutcomes:   The goal of an average GPA of 3.0 for each participant was exceeded.  The average overall GPA was 3.65 in YR1; 3.68 in YR2; 3.57 in YR3; 3.37 in YR4; and 3.34 in YR5.  Therefore, the average GPA for all five years was: 3.52.  \n\n \n\nObjective: To graduate 80% of S-STEM students and assure they are in the top 30% of their graduating class.\n\n\n \n\nOutcomes:  The goal of graduating 80% of S-STEM students within three years was exceeded.  89% of the students graduated in YR1; 90% of the students graduated in YR2; 100% of the students graduated in YR3; and 89% of the students graduated in YR4. (Statistics will not be available for the sophomores completing YR5 for two more years).  Therefore, the average number of NSF students graduating in four years was 92%.\n\n \n\nObjective: To achieve an average 80% success rate in the number of transfer program participants who obtain admittance to a four-year college/university or obtain job placement within 12 months of graduation.\n\n\n \n\nOutcomes:  The goal of an average of 80% of graduates transferring to a four-year college/university or obtaining job placement within 12 months was met.  78% transferred in YR1; 80% transferred in YR2; 85% transferred in YR3; 74% transferred in YR4; and 81% transferred in YR5.  Therefore, an average of 80% of NSF graduates transferred to a four-year college/university or obtained job placement within 12 months of graduation.\n\nBroader Impact Outcomes:  This project was designed to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields through the provision of programs and activities with proven results. The broader impacts of this project included exposing academically-talented, but financially disadvantaged high school students to STEM-oriented community college programming, strengthening STEM workforce readiness in Southwest Virginia by preparing this target student population for regional STEM careers, and expanding what is known about viable pathways to the STEM workforce for promising, low-income students hailing from economically distressed communities. All of these activities could be applicable to similar communities nationwide.\n\nIntellectual Merits:  This project sought to meet the demand for STEM graduates by providing..."
