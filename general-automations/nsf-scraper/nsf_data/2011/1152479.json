 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inaccuracy in computation has usually been considered with a negative connotation and, therefore,\r\nconventional computing systems have been designed with a strict notion of correctness.\r\nHowever, inaccuracy or approximation is not always bad since several application domains\r\nare intrinsically tolerant to varying degrees of relaxation in accuracy,\r\nand thus, such a property can be exploited for significant gain in application performance or fault-tolerance.\r\nThe motivation of this EAGER project is to investigate the feasibility of utilizing such approximation,\r\nalso known as \"soft computing\", for data-intensive applications for predicting the performance-power-accuracy\r\ntrade-offs. The research consists of three intertwined tasks. The first task would examine a variety of\r\nhigh performance computing (HPC) and MapReduce style data analytic applications, and determine\r\nwhich classes of applications are suitable for soft computing.\r\nThe second component of the research is aimed at developing appropriate techniques for facilitating\r\nsoft computing, while the last task focuses on examining the possibility of developing a control theoretic\r\nmodel for formalizing the various tradeoff analysis.\r\n\r\nThis project aims at demonstrating that it is possible to achieve significant power and performance\r\ngain for a wide variety of data intensive applications through soft computing. \r\nThe approach adopted in this research has the potential to influence the programming paradigm for many\r\nclasses of scientific and business applications for optimizing the power-performance behavior.\r\nThe cross-cutting nature of this research has potential to foster new research directions in several areas,\r\nspanning high performance computing, computer architecture, compilers, and system/application software.\r\nUndergraduate and graduate students involved in this research will get versatile training in several areas.\r\nThe software tools developed in this research will be used in teaching\r\nexisting and new courses, and will be made publicly available.",
