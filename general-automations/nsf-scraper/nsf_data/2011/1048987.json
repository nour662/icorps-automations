 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will provide a high-latitude regional focus for several of the primary objectives of the Decadal and Regional Climate Prediction program: an evaluation of regional variability and extreme events as simulated by a state-of-the-art global system model (the Community Earth System Model, CESM);  quantification of the impacts of climate variability on the marine ecosystem, the terrestrial landscape and sea ice in the Arctic; and the ability of the Community Earth System Model to capture ecosystem-relevant variability over seasonal to decadal timescales.   The system model enhancements will focus on marine ecosystem, which will be included through a spatially explicit lower trophic food web model encompassing nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton.   The terrestrial tasks will include more advanced formulations of fire and related phenological processes for incorporation into CESM, enabling evaluations of the sensitivities of terrestrial changes to potentially predictable variations in the drivers of land surface processes.  Finally, sea ice variability has been shown to influence both the marine ecosystem (by altering the environment of phytoplankton blooms and their interactions with other trophic levels) and the surrounding terrestrial regions (through temperature and moisture fluxes), highlighting the need for an emphasis on sea ice in an earth system model approach to predicting Arctic variability on seasonal to decadal timescales.  The broader impacts of the proposed work include the potential for incorporating into a state-of-the-art system model a marine ecosystem module that includes fish, marine mammals and, eventually, fishing pressure, thereby serving as a tool for planning and decision-making.  In the terrestrial realm, the modification of the high-latitude landscape by fire will likely be increasingly important not only for planning and adaptation locally, but for feedbacks to the broader climate system through surface properties and carbon exchange.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe utilized the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to assess Arctic sea ice predictability and variability over seasonal to decadal timescales and to assess the impact of trends and variability of Arctic ice on the surrounding terrestrial climate and ecoystems.  Projections of September sea ice in the CESM1 exhibit instances of rapid sea ice loss in the 21st century (Vavrus et al., 2012).  Interannual variability in September ice extent increases as the ice cover thins and retreats.  These features of the Arctic system were examined in much greater detail through the CESM large ensemble, a 30 member ensemble of 20th century and RCP8.5 (business as usual greenhouse gas forcing scenario) simulations, differing only by small atmospheric perturbations in the year 1920.  \n\nInterestingly, the large ensemble data indicate the possibility of up to a decade-long cessation of sea ice loss when the natural variability counteracts the anthropogenically-forced decline.   September reaches ice free conditions (&lt;1 million km2) by between 2035-2055 depending on the ensemble member.  Most ensemble members exhibit rapid ice loss events in September as indicated by the 5-year ice extent trends.  These rapid ice loss events are most prevalent in the 2010-2040 time period.  However, instances of increasing 5-year trends also occur due to the large natural variability.  This is an important result as it indicates that short term trends in sea ice extent, either increasing or decreasing, cannot necessarily be interpreted as evidence for or against anthropogenic climate change.\n\nThe number of ice free days within different polar bear ecoregions increases considerably over the 21st century. For the Southern Beaufort Sea (see Figure 1), the threshold of 160 ice-free days per year is passed around 2040 for the CESM-LE ensemble mean. For the medium ensemble with the RCP4.5 forcing, this threshold is passed in a similar timeframe. However, the number of ice-free days within the region remains quite stable after 2040 under the RCP4.5 forcing. This has implications for polar bear health in this region and suggests that mitigation efforts could lead to a more stable polar bear population there.\n\nFurther analysis of the model shows that periods of rapid ice loss increase the rate of land warming by a factor of 2 or 3.  This accelerated warming can initiate feedbacks in the land, including the formation of talik (situation where previously perpetually frozen soil (permafrost), thaws and no longer refreezes in winter).  Widespread talik formation is projected over the next 30-40 years, which leads to abrupt changes in carbon cycling due to the fact that soil respiration can occur throughout the year, rather than just in the summer, in the talik zone. \n\nAt the pan-Arctic scale, offline Community Land Model (CLM4.5BGC) results reported in Koven et al. (2015) demonstrate that, when averaged across the permafrost domain, the region is not expected to transition from a sink to a source of greenhouse gas emissions within the next several decades, even if there is a period of accelerated warming due to sea ice loss, though in some regions, especially those along the southern permafrost boundary, the transition from sink to source appears to be imminent (see Figure 2).  Arctic vegetation responds quickly to the more favorable projected Arctic climate and the higher CO2 concentrations, leading to carbon uptake over the domain through at least the middle of the 21st century.\n\nWe found that the CLM4.5BGC fire scheme is significantly improved over CLM4 for boreal North America (see Figure 3).  The CLM4 fire model showed almost no interannual variability in fire area burned, contrary to observations.  The CLM4.5BGC model is biased high in terms of the total amount of fire, but shows reasonable interannual variations.  Deficiencies with the CLM phenology scheme were uncovered and resolved within this project. Analysis of CESM1 simulations indicated that under future str..."
