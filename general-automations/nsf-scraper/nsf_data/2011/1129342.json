 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project seeks to investigate the effect of informal, out-of-school learning activities on students' decisions to attend engineering degree programs.  The study builds on the success of the \"Design Squad\" TV series that engages many middle-school aged youth.  The study uses survey methods as well as interviews to collect data which will be analyzed using social cognitive career theory.  \r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be to increase understanding of how informal educational activities influence students' choices in college majors and thus their ultimate career choices.  The research focuses specifically on young women who are a group generally under-represented in engineering degree programs.  The project builds on strong partnerships with many other youth organizations such as the Girl Scouts of the USA.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.",
