 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of forest communities is shaped by both environmental factors and interactions between organisms.  Recent evidence from both tropical and temperate forests suggests that host-specific pathogens play a major role in shaping forest community development at seedling stage, especially for less abundant species. The seedling to sapling transition is a critical stage of the tree life cycle that will determine forest community composition for years to come.  The goal of this project is to determine, using experiments in natural forests and the greenhouse, the role of pathogens in determining the outcome of the seedling to sapling transition in relation to the plants' proximity to adult trees of the same species. Seedlings and saplings will be sampled in three different forests where all trees greater than 1 centimeter diameter have been mapped and tagged.  These forests in Virginia, Indiana and Wisconsin will provide a broad geographic sampling of eastern temperate forests. The survival and growth of seedlings and saplings of several species will be tracked for two years to determine their rates of mortality and growth around randomly selected adult trees.  The results will inform species selection for greenhouse studies to determine the factors behind seedling success or failure in the forests.  The researchers predict that rare species in the community will be more affected by pathogens in the early life stages than more common species.\r\n\r\nForests are vital to a sustainable human society and provide an essential renewable resource.  It is therefore important to understand how forests grow and develop.  This research will inform conservation and management efforts of forest systems by highlighting the role that pathogen-driven mortality has in structuring forest communities. Additionally, it will provide evidence on how forest regeneration may be affected by climate change by examining the regional differences in species performance across a latitudinal gradient.  Finally, the researchers will continue their outreach partnerships with local and national land conservancies to educate the public on the results of this research and the importance of forest in general.",

Understanding the distribution and abundance of species requires an understanding of the factors controlling species diversity. Species diversity is important because more diverse systems are more resilient to changes and tend to be more productive than less diverse systems. The dissertation work of Daniel Johnson funded by this project aimed to help understand the factors important for determining the diversity of temperate forest tree species. The fact that many plant species can co-exist in a given area has historically driven this line of questioning. Plants need a few basic things to survive, grow and reproduce: light, water, carbon dioxide and a small suite of soil nutrients. Given these limited requirements, why does a single plant species not out-compete and displace every other species for those requirements? There are likely trade-offs in how plants compete for their basic requirements. For example, being good at acquiring light might make a plant less tolerant to drought. In recent years, the concept those species-specific enemies play an important role in maintaining species diversity has gained increasing support, especially in tropical forests. The presence of a given species may attract enemies of that species like insects and pathogens.
