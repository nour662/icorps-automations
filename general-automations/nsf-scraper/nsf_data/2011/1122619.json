This rise in inequality has occurred alongside increases in productivity levels.  In decades past, productivity improvements were generally spread across a wide swath of the workforce, spurred on by labor unions that helped institutionalize norms of pay allocation, patterning wages across broad industries among union and nonunion workers, and internal labor markets within firms that smoothed over changes in individual productivity over the life course.  This de-coupling of productivity and earnings over the past generation represents a profound shift in how wages are allocated to workers. \r\n\r\nThis project utilizes five individual- and business establishment-level datasets on U.S., English, and Canadian workers, and has three specific objectives.  The first is to estimate the causes and consequences of the collapse of union wage bargaining among remaining union members.  The second objective is to document the rise of personalized pay at the workplace and measure how this wage-setting institution has exacerbated within-group inequality among union and nonunion workers.  The third objective is to estimate how personalized pay practices help de-couple average wages from productivity levels.  Each objective explores workplace dynamics that have widened wage gaps while de-linking average pay from productivity levels.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\n\r\nThe project will have broad reaching social impacts in the following ways.  First, the data depository made available to the public will combine establishment-level data from three different nations standardized with a common codebook, and will serve as one of the most comprehensive sources of establishment-level workplace data available.  Second, the availability of establishment-level information combined with the dissemination of the results of the analyses will open up new areas of inquiry, especially for researchers interested in racial and gender discrimination at work.  \r\n\r\nWhile the focus of this project centers on patterns of within-group inequality and their relation to new wage-setting institutions, the analyses can be easily adapted to focus on the employer characteristics that lead to inequality between ascriptive categories.  The data and analyses provided by this project will allow future researchers to explore how ascriptive categories translate into unequal economic outcomes in the contemporary era of growing employer power.  \r\n\r\nThird, the analyses proposed in this project will help illuminate debates surrounding inequality trends that extend well beyond the research community.  As policymakers and public intellectuals wrangle over potential remedies for recent inequality trends, rigorous research about the causes and consequences of these much-discussed developments is crucial.",

Our third set of objectives involves documenting how transparent firms are regarding pay and financial information, and assessing what factors predict whether or not an establishment shares pay and financial information with its employees.  Finally, we seek to uncover how secrecy regarding company pay practices and financial information influences inequality. Our hypothesis here is that those workers who report that their managers disseminate financial or pay-related information will receive higher hourly wages than workers who report their managers do not share such information.\n\n \n\nKey findings include the following: in our examination of U.S. workplace data, we find that personalized pay practices are less common in non-profit enterprises compared to for-profit enterprises.

This is a particularly robust finding that remains even after we control statistically for the effects of educational attainment, occupation, and workplace characteristics on wage rates. \n\n \n\nThis project has documented the prevalence of new sources of wage inequality in workplaces in the U.S. and abroad.
