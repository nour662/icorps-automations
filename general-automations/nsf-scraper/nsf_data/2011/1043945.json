 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop a framework for undergraduate curriculum in security and privacy for pervasive computing environments at three levels: (1) security and privacy for emerging application-layer protocols; (2) wireless security; and (3) security for handheld and resource-constrained devices. The proposed integrated software framework for security and privacy for pervasive computing is a novel and transformative idea. The authors propose to: (1) implement an instructional service discovery protocol suite to reduce the barrier for undergraduate students; (2) develop projects and lab exercises to explore wireless LAN and wireless PAN security; (3) build a collection of lab modules and assignments for students to understand attacks and explore defense approaches for smart phones and wireless sensors.\r\n\r\nThe deliverables of this project are available in a repository to share with other institutions, as well as to allow them to contribute modules and components. The project has a potential impact on future software programmers, administrators, and users of pervasive computing devices concerned with their security and privacy. It provides realistic projects to learn about the real-world threats and defenses.",
