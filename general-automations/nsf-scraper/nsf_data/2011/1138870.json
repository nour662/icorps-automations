Building on a comprehensive update of our current knowledge of the Earth system and the pressure it is under, the conference will present and debate new insights into potential opportunities and constraints for innovative development pathways based on novel partnerships.  The conference will focus on three broad themes which are critical to the scientific and societal challenges surrounding global sustainability.  These themes are: \r\n\r\n1. Meeting global needs: food, energy, water and other ecosystem services; \r\n2. Transforming our way of living: development pathways under global environmental change; and\r\n3. Governing across scales: innovative stewardship of the Earth system. \r\n\r\nThis conference will provide a critical step toward reaching solutions to these challenges and will provide a venue to highlight the current state of our planet prior to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in June of 2012.  The conference will bring together 2,500 global change experts from around the world in a discussion of the current status of, future predictions for and potential solutions to the issue of global change as it relates to human and environmental sustainability.  The synthesis of ideas generated at the conference will advance our collective understanding of the pressures on our planet and what steps need to be taken to alleviate these pressures while maintaining and promoting quality of life. The conference will provide a venue for early career and developing country scientists and students to forge new international networks and partnerships to better understand and overcome the issues involved in providing pathways for a sustainable planet.  A major component of the conference will be stakeholder engagement through plenary talks, technical sessions, workshops and seminars.  In addition, the conference will include strong policy and science interactions through these mechanisms and strong public engagement through webcasts and interactive media.",
