 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary theme of the JILA PFC is to address the challenge of bridging the gap from few-body physics to many-body physics through quantum control. The central scientific objective is to extend the remarkable level of control and understanding that physicists have for few-body systems to many-body quantum systems. Quantum systems made up of many particles and their interactions play an essential role in much of physics, including condensed matter physics, material physics, nuclear physics, high-energy particle physics, astrophysics, biophysics, and chemical physics. The JILA PFC will focus upon the challenge of controlling and understanding multi-particle quantum systems using the tools and ideas of atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics, which, ironically, is a field of physics for which many-body physics has not traditionally been emphasized. AMO physics is in the midst of a revolution, evidenced, for example, by the remarkable accomplishments in recent years of experiments on ultracold gases, ultrafast laser technology, and ultraprecise spectroscopy. This revolution affords a new approach for confronting the behavior of complex multi-particle systems using control at the quantum level. \r\n\r\nIn the period 2011- 2016, the JILA PFC investigators will apply the tools of modern AMO physics to tackle the challenge of bridging the gap from few-body to many-body quantum physics from both sides, using cutting-edge techniques to study few-body problems beyond current understanding and many-particle ensembles in regimes beyond the limits of a mean-field description. Specific questions to be addressed are (1) What new insights can one bring to quantum many-body physics using ultracold atom and molecule gases as model systems? (2) Can one extend AMO's measurement and control techniques to create new types of many-body systems using coherent light-matter coupling? (3) Can one understand and address, in the few- to many-body problem, the physics of molecule formation and, more generally, chemical reactions by applying cutting-edge technologies to control and probe simple molecular systems? (4) What are potential high impact research directions that are closely tied to this work?  The research will take place at JILA, a multidisciplinary research institute located on the University of Colorado campus in Boulder, and builds upon the extensive results achieved under the present PFC funding. Significant results in nanokelvin molecular physics, in non-classical behavior of nano-oscillators and microwave fields, and in various probes of solid and liquid dynamics across timescales that span twelve orders of magnitude, all set the stage for rapid future progress in four major activities:.\r\n\r\nMajor Activity 1: Building complex matter from the ground up.\r\n\r\nWork in this area will explore the rich phenomena arising in novel quantum many-body systems that are assembled from ultracold atoms and molecules. This major activity, which has strong connections to condensed matter physics, will include research in dipolar molecular quantum gases and strongly interacting atomic quantum gases. Specific research goals include exploring the boundary between gaseous and liquid behavior in gases of strongly interacting particles, and realizing novel states of quantum matter using the long-range and anisotropic interactions between ultracold polar molecules.\r\n\r\nMajor Activity 2: Engineering quantum many-body systems using light-matter coupling.\r\n\r\nThis activity will extend quantum control to increasingly complex systems by exploiting coherent light matter interactions. Projects will explore collective light emission from cold atoms, the quantum motion of nano-mechanical oscillators, and light-induced coherence in material systems. An example project is an ambitious effort to map non-classical photon states in the microwave onto corresponding states in optical modes and vice versa, using a nanomechanical \"diving board\" as the coupling medium.\r\n\r\nMajor Activity 3: Confronting molecular transformation.\r\n\r\nAt the most basic level, reactions proceed via the interaction between electrons and the coupling between electronic and nuclear motion. JILA PFC investigators will explore the physics of reactions at this fundamental level, with the goal of understanding, and learning to control, energy flow in small systems such as triatomic and tetratomic molecules. They will focus on three projects: studying cold and ultracold reactive molecular scattering, probing time-resolved nuclear and electronic dynamics, and developing coherent UV to IR molecular spectroscopy.\r\n\r\nMajor Activity 4: Exploring high impact synergistic research directions.\r\n\r\nAn essential aspect of JILA's center philosophy is that one should be alert to opportunities to \"export\" interesting ideas and technologies to activities outside the central focus of the center, and to import these as well. JILA will explore a few of these opportunities, investing a small fraction of center resources in facilitating this trade in ideas and technology.\r\n\r\nThe major activities share a common focus, and therefore have substantial intellectual and scientific overlap, and, if, anything, still stronger technological overlap. Prior experience has shown that the extraordinarily challenging goals envisioned for the JILA PFC are best tackled with fluid collaborations that can draw on a range of capabilities, such as laser frequency combs, ultracold atoms, advanced VUV sources, quantum and ultrafast optics, the sensitive detection methods of chemical physics, and theoretical methods, both computational and analytic. This diversity of expertise cannot readily be synthesized in an individual investigator's group. In addition, the JILA PFC relies on and continuously upgrades a shared technical infrastructure including a world-class machine shop, as well as electronics and computational support, and engages in a collective program of education and outreach efforts.\r\n\r\nThe JILA program will have many different broader impacts. It will enhance the nation's technical infrastructure by developing many new laser-based tools and techniques, and by producing many graduates who are highly trained not only in AMO physics but also in technical communication and teaching skills. It will connect with the science community around the world and foster field-wide frontier research through organization and hosting of topical workshops, through a short-term and long-term JILA visitor program, as well as through the many undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers who participate in the collaborative and interdisciplinary research at JILA. As discussed above, the proposed work connects to many different areas of physics, including applied areas such as materials physics, biophysics, and nanotechnology. Extending understanding and quantum control from few- to many-body systems will certainly impact many applications, such as photosynthesis, design of catalytic materials, and new techniques in renewable energy.  The proposed program will also attract more students into science, particularly from under-represented groups, through a vigorous undergraduate research program and a predominantly minority-serving middle-school after-school enrichment program. It will contribute to general science interest and literacy through a variety of programs that include the very popular \"Wizards\" show for school children, the University of Colorado Saturday Physics public talks, and suitably trained graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who present science topics to Colorado middle-school and high-school students. It will also research, develop, and broadly disseminate better ways to teach AMO science to all students, better ways to teach AMO science to all students, particularly through on-line interactive simulation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nJILA PFC: Bridging the Gap from Few-Body to Many-Body through Quantum Control NSF 1125844\n\nAfter six years of effort by 20 faculty members and roughly 100 more junior scientists, the activities of the JILA PFC (Physics Frontier Center): Bridging the Gap from Few-Body to Many-Body through Quantum Control have come to a close.  Here are a few highlights:\n\nJILA investigators including Murray Holland, Ana Maria Rey, James Thompson and Jun Ye teamed up to create the world's most accurate optical lattice clock, with accuracy to around 1 second in the lifetime of the universe.  This kind of accuracy can help determine if the laws of physics are perfectly immutable or if instead are ever-so-slightly changing as time goes by.  It can also be used to study spooky, only-just-there quantum collective effects between large numbers of ultra-cold atoms held in egg-carton-like corrugated potential of an optical lattice.\n\nCindy Regal and Konrad Lehnert used laser-cooling techniques to calm the thermal motion of a microscopic trampoline until it was moving as slowly as quantum mechanics would permit.  Objects like this are useful for writing the quantum nature of microwaves (used in tiny quantum circuits) onto lasers of visible light (used to communicate quantum information from one location to another).\n\nAna Maria Rey and Cindy Regal have come up with a novel way to generate and propagate quantum entanglement using single atoms carried in tiny traps called optical tweezers.\n\nEric Cornell and Jun Ye, with support from John Bohn, showed how one can make measurements on trapped molecules in which the electron?s quantum state is coherent for more than one second.  With the electron living in the extreme high electric fields that exist between the atoms of a molecule, the result is exquisite sensitivity to detect any possible out-of-roundness of the electron, which in turn casts light on the conditions in the very early seconds of the universe.\n\nDeborah Jin and Eric Cornell showed how one can create an ultracold gas that interacts so strongly it has qualities approaching that of a liquid. Although this exotic state of matter lives for less than a millisecond, that's long enough to see how the many-body behavior of the fluid is sensitive to few-body physics at the microscopic level.  Meanwhile, Heather Lewandowski's experimental study of collisions in an ultracold gas validated a century-old prediction that under circumstances the normal forces of friction don't cause motion to damp out.\n\nMargaret Murnane and Henry Kapteyn, with theoretical support from Andreas Becker and Agnieszka Jaron-Becker, used precisely controlled ultrafast lasers to generate high harmonics, pulses of soft x-rays, with oscillating electric fields measured and controlled at the attosecond level.  Not only strength but also direction (polarization) of the x-rays were changing.  These kind of coherent x-ray pulses were used to study the ultrafast behavior of electrons in the technologically important magnetic material, nickel, and to understand how fast it takes for a photon to kick an electron out of a molecule, all at attosecond time scales.\n\nDavid Nesbitt and Ralph Jimenez used lasers to probe biologically relevant molecular behavior, including how strands of RNA fold and unfold in the presence of a molecularly \"crowded\" environment such as is found within a living cell.   Mathias Weber investigated the basic molecular reactions that underlie the catalysis that will be necessary to convert carbon dioxide back into useful fuels. \n\nThe work of the PFC has been documented by 460 papers and shared in more than 1100 oral presentations at venues around the world.  Results were also disseminated at specialized workshops hosted at JILA.  Individual JILA scientists at both the junior and senior level  received many national-level recognitions and honors.\n\nThe cutting-edge research environment is the ideal anvil for forging highly trained technical people who will contribute to the nation's high-tech workforce, and who in turn will provide training for the next generation on.  Many JILA students were snapped up by US high-tech industry, in particular quantum-related companies, where they are part of a key technological cadre that ensures our national technological competitiveness.    From 2011-2017, dozens of JILA-trained people, including 14 women and under-represented minorities, were hired into faculty positions in colleges and universities around the nation and the world. \n\nWith an eye towards beneficial impact still further into America's future, the JILA NSF Physics Frontier Center sent JILA graduate students to Colorado middle schools (in particular ones which serve a large Latino community) where they led programs of after-school science enrichment activities.  At the end of each semester-long program, the middle school kids came on a field trip to JILA to interact with their JILA mentors in a university environment.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric A Cornell"
