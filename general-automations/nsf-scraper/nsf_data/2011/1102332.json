Current prototype devices show that liquid crystals are promising materials for signal processing over a wide frequency range. \r\nObjective\r\n1) Simplification of the current device structures to reduce processing steps.\r\n2) Reduction of losses in liquid crystal devices\r\n3) Identification of liquid crystals with the best performance in the microwave and creation of new liquid crystals materials by doping with high dielectric nanoparticles or ferroelectric nanoparticles.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe project will result in devices with several important advantages: 1) they will provide a tunable true-time delay or a large tunable phase shift, 2) the devices will require almost no power consumption, 3) there is a low loss tangent over a wide frequency range, 4) the devices will be small and can be integrated into an on-wafer system. \r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe expected commercial and social benefits of the proposed activity will be substantial as the developed devices will have utility in a variety of photonic devices including phase retarders and true time delay lines, micro phased array systems, changeable focus lenses, and beam steering devices. In addition, it will provide new opportunities for the mature liquid crystal industry by creating new non-display applications of liquid crystals.\r\nWe are planning also for extensive interactions with industry and outreach activities to undergraduate, graduate, and high and middle schools students.",
