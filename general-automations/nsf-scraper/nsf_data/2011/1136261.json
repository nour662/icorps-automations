 "awd_abstract_narration": "While researchers in Geometric Topology have made enormous progress in understanding manifolds (multi-connected spaces), the concept is only now entering the popular imagination.  The P.I.?s current work lets ordinary people experience 2- and 3-manifolds directly: Every day hundreds of people download the Torus and Klein Bottle Games for their iPhones and iPads, many more download the desktop versions, and the P.I.'s software appears in science museums and on the Science Channel (Summer 2011).  The present project's goals are to maintain and extend the existing software, so people may use the full suite of programs on newer devices like tablets and phones as well as on traditional desktop and laptop computers; to write new software that will let non-mathematicians understand 3-manifolds in the same user-friendly way that the Torus and Klein Bottle Games currently let them understand 2-manifolds;  and to develop software to better understand planar tilings and their symmetry groups. The practical need for efficient tiling algorithms has also led to some interesting theoretical progress (using the hyperbolic and euclidean analogs of spin space to manage the isometries of a surface) that will be pursued further.  While continuing to support classroom use of the Geometry Games software, the proposal puts equal emphasis on introducing topological and geometrical ideas into the common culture.\r\n\r\nHumanity's understanding of geometry has advanced tremendously over the past two centuries, and continues to advance today. Nevertheless, the popular conception of geometry all too often remains limited to the Euclidean geometry of 2000 years ago. The present project aims to help bring the public's understanding of geometry up to date.  The main new idea -- that space itself has a \"shape\" -- is not inherently difficult to understand, but it is difficult to explain in words. Explanations with pictures work a little better, but in practice they too usually prove inadequate.  The only truly effective way for a student (or nonspecialist adult) to fully grasp the new concept of space is for the student to experience the new space for him or herself. The P.I.'s existing software for this purpose has been well received (the iOS version alone gets 4000+ new users each week). The present project will develop and extend this software to let people better experience 3D spaces as well as 2D spaces, along with related concepts of symmetry. The motivation for developing the public understanding of modern geometry is two-fold:  first, to prepare the next generation of scientists and engineers, who will need strong 3D visualization skills as well as a modern understanding of geometry and space; second, so that all people may understand and enjoy geometry as a part of our shared culture, just as all people may enjoy literature and music.",
