 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lichens and bryophytes share biological traits that make them some of the most sensitive indicators of environmental change. The goal of this project is to provide high quality data to address how species distributions change as a result of major environmental events across time and space. Specifically, this project will digitize the label information (the what, when, where and by whom collected) and images for approximately 2.3 million biological specimens curated in North American lichen and bryophyte herbaria. These collections represent well over 90% of all specimens collected in Canada, the United States and Mexico and held by over 60 US non-governmental institutions. New, on-line digitization techniques will be made publically available at at http://symbiota.org/nalichens/ and http://symbiota.org/bryophytes/, and will allow interested members of the public to be involved and learn about biodiversity alongside the professionals.\r\n\r\nAvailability of nearly the entire North American bryophyte and lichen collections on-line will greatly accelerate knowledge and evaluation of the biodiversity of these organisms by fostering collaborations between professionals and the general public. Additionally, models developed from these digitized data will aid future mapping projections of large scale species distributions and identification of biodiversity hotspots as prime candidates for protection. These endeavors will help to elucidate regions where changes are imminent and likely to have substantial impact, as well as to facilitate proactive initiatives to alleviate such changes. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "LBCC Outcomes\n\nIntellectual Merit \n\nAs a result of this project, the Illinois Natural History Survey at the University of Illinois digitized 28,030 specimens of bryophytes and 10,596 specimens of lichens in addition to contributing 18,519 existing specimen records that were previously digitized.  Specimens from the following institutions were also digitized by the Illinois Natural History Survey:  University of Nebraska (10,709 bryophyte and 16,838 lichen specimens) and University of Nebraska at Kearney (3,827 bryophyte and 198 lichen specimens).  All digital records and images are available online through the Bryophyte and Lichen portals where they serve as a major resource to scientists, public land managers, students, and amateur enthusiasts.  Since our specimen data has been uploaded online to these portals, we have received several inquiries from other researchers for loans of specimens.  In addition, experts in bryophytes and lichens have been able to examine our data online and have assisted in the updating of taxonomic names of our specimens to their most current and correct names, thereby increasing the quality of our collections.\n\nOur digitized specimen data spans a wide geographic and historic range and includes a large breath of taxonomic groups, which allows environmental models to predict how species distributions have changed due to major environmental events across time and space.  Because our specimen records are georeferenced, large-scale distribution mapping can elucidate regions where such changes have occurred while also identifying biodiversity hotspots and under sampled areas.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis project has served as an excellent opportunity to train the next generation of collection managers.  One postgraduate student and one undergraduate student have been trained in the fundamentals of specimen digitization, including the photographing of specimen labels, annotation slips and selected specimens, the organization, backup and transfer of record and image data to a central collection server, the transcription of specimen data, and the georeferencing of specimen locality data.  In addition, students learned the basic biology and natural history of bryophytes and lichens.\n\nThe postgraduate student gave a presentation on the Bryophytes of Illinois highlighting the web-based Bryophyte portal at the bi-annual Naturally Illinois Expo at the Illinois Natural History Survey where over 2300 people, including 900 K-12 students, attended this two-day event.  The Illinois Natural History Survey participates in ongoing formal and informal training of volunteers and students where we provide demonstrations of the techniques, equipment and workflow used in this project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/07/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew N Miller"
