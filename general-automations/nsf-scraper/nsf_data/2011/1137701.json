 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Cari S. Dutcher was awarded an Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a research project with Anthony Wexler at the University of California at Davis (UCD). Dutcher will employ a statistical thermodynamic approach to the uptake of atmospherically important species onto particles that are important in the air, such as black carbon, organics and water-containing aerosols. The thermodynamic treatment of aerosol properties will be extended to conditions found in the upper troposphere, with low temperatures (relevant to higher altitudes and latitudes) and at low relative humidity (relevant to arid climates and some higher altitude situations). Results will enhance thermodynamic predictions of the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM) and will improve understanding of (1) the interactions of gases, particles, aerosols and water in the earth's atmosphere, (2) the modification of thermodynamic properties in the cold, dry arid conditions found in the upper troposphere and (3) the impact, both direct and indirect, sorption processes have on the role of particles in climate.\r\n\r\nDutcher will also develop a web-based model calculator to enable those who are not experts in atmospheric thermodynamics to make effective use of models for practical calculations. Dutcher will integrate research and education through mentorship of undergraduate researchers and by engaging in interactive environmental and conservational demonstrations at local schools. The project will also support the outreach programs currently underway at the Air Quality Research Center at UCD, hosting activities from high-school group tours to international conferences in air quality and climate change. Several activities would be aimed at young girls.",
