 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the Penn World Table (PWT).  This is a data resource for making international comparisons of economic performance (income, output, and production) across countries.  The data have been widely used both as a dependent variable to be explained (studies of the determinants of economic performance) and as a control variable included in other studies as a way to control for differences across countries in economic resources.\r\n\r\nThe PWT continues to be updated on a regular basis to take into account changes in economic performance.  In addition to requesting support for these updates, the PIs want to improve the methods used to make the international comparisons.  The PWT has relied\r\n in part on a comparison program conducted by the UN and the World Bank.  That comparison has focused on the expenditure side of national accounts (what a country consumes, invests, spends on government activities, exports, and imports).  An alternative way to compare economies is to consider the production side of national accounts.  The PWT team is collaborating with a leading European research group to incorporate these production comparisons into the PWT.  They develop separate estimates of production and income that are comparable across countries, and use several different analytic approaches in order to appraise which approach is most effective for future maintenance of the PWT.\r\n\r\nThey also develop improved models of the relationship between implicit growth rates implied by their comparisons to national growth rates calculated through national income accounts.  The question is how to use economic theory and empirical methods to best account for economic growth when both economic structures and relative prices are changing over time.\r\n\r\nThe Penn World Tables are widely used by researchers, policymakers, and students who are interested in international economic comparisons.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBackground:\n\nThe collaborative research is concerned with international comparisons of prices, incomes and production across countries as well as within countries.  The building blocks of this research are (a) the national income and product accounts maintained by all countries such as Gross Domestic Product and Consumption and (b) national and the periodic price surveys carried out under the auspices of the United Nations with implementation of the OECD, regional development Banks and the World Bank.  These periodic surveys are part of the International Comparison Program or ICP.  The ICP began in 1968;  the number of countries participating has risen from 10 in the 1970 comparison to 190 countries in the 2011 Report.\n\nThe Penn World Table or PWT\n\nPWT arose to fill in countries and years that the ICP did not provide and to modify the methods used in the ICP that were often constrained by the need to gain support of participating countries and regional groups.  PWT was publically available from the 1980s to the present.  One important achievement over during the period of this research was to transfer PWT from the University of Pennsylvania to the Universities of Groningen in the Netherlands and the University of California at Davis.  This change was accompanied by several major improvements in method, namely distinguishing between income and production, provision of measures of human and physical capital and better measures of growth over time. These improvements are likely to be incorporated in future ICP rounds because those producing PWT also are members of the expert group advising Global Office of the ICP.\n\nAn Application of the ICP to Estimating the World Poverty Line\n\nThe World Bank has since the 1980s produced a world poverty line where persons below that line, initially $1 a day, are classified as extremely poor.  The ICP provides the purchasing power parity (PPP) that converts national currency lines to US dollars, so that the poverty line (most recently $1.90) represents the same quantity of goods and services in all countries.  In our research we have improved on the Bank methodology by only considering PPPs dervived from comparing the povery countries so that Japan or the United States cannot influence the results.  Further we have modified the ICP concept of Consumption to exclude certain expenditures that are not consumed by the extremely poor, for example imputed financial services.  The results of this research are being presented at the World Bank and hopefully improve the measurement of extreme poverty and provide a better perspective of the incidence and the size of effort to move towards its elimination.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan Heston"
