 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in genome sequencing have transformed marine microbial ecology. Metagenomic datasets have led to the discovery of new protein families, underscored the importance of the rare biosphere and even allowed the study of intra-population diversity of dominant members of the community such as Prochlorococcus. Although open ocean microbial communities have been repeatedly demonstrated to vary significantly with depth, in terms of both phylogenetic diversity and biogeochemical function, the vast majority of sequence available in public databases is from surface waters. Much less is known about microbial communities below the surface of the ocean, even those at 50-200m. Next generation sequencing technologies offer a dramatic reduction in cost per base compared to Sanger or even pyrosequencing approaches. The very short read lengths from these platforms have not yet been successfully applied to mixed communities. This project is a metagenomic study of the microbial communities throughout the water column in the South Atlantic gyre using the ABI SOLiD platform with the following objectives:\r\n\r\n- Construct and sequence paired-end metagenomic libraries from the surface, chlorophyll maximum, deep euphotic zone and twilight zone in the South Atlantic gyre using ABI SOLiD technology.\r\n- Apply information theory based software methods to assemble the short read sequences and reconstruct the phylogenetic diversity and metabolic potential of these communities. \r\n- Compare reconstructed sequences to existing metagenomic data from other parts of the world's oceans and to metaproteomic data from the the same location to inform sampling strategies and methodological choices for a proposed global molecular oceanic survey (Biogeotraces)\r\n\r\nThis project is appropriate as an EAGER because the genomic potential of deep euphotic zone and twilight zone communities will be very different from those in surface waters. Thus, this dataset will reshape our understanding of oligotrophic community function. Second, the massive advance in data generated at a low cost by short-read sequencing platforms has the potential to transform microbial oceanography by allowing metagenomic analyses to be routinely employed in hypothesis-driven experiments. However, new interdisciplinary tools are required to assemble and interpret this data. Until these next generation bioinformatic methods are established, proposals that take advantage of these technological breakthroughs remain high risk.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Metagenomic analyses of microbial communities collected on a GEOTRACES compliant cruise in the South Atlantic will provide a pilot dataset demonstrating the potential of short-read sequencing technologies for a future sectional molecular survey program. A post-doctoral researcher and a graduate student will be trained in the interdisciplinary perspectives required to analyze this sequence data and interpret it in a biogeochemical context.",

However, most of them have never been grown in the lab and thus we know very little about the specifics of their capabilities.  In this project we used metagenomics, an approach to look at all the genetic material in a water sample at once, to understand what kinds of microbes are present in the seawater and what kinds of elemental transformations they might be doing.\n Many approaches to analyzing metagenomic data are capable of recognizing the different types of genes that carry out different functions, but only provide a rough approximation of which organism each gene came from.  Here, we developed a set of computational tools to streamline the process of more specifically identifying which organism each gene in our metagenomes came from. This software is publically available for others to use.\n Our samples came from two study sites, the South Atlantic Gyre, a representative of much of the open ocean, and the Eastern Tropical North Pacific, where a naturally occurring area of zero oxygen provides an environment where microbes capable of using nitrate instead of oxygen thrive. Their transformations affect the global balance of nitrogen between the ocean and the atmosphere.\n The transformation of nitrate in seawater to nitrogen gas that can be lost from the water to the atmosphere is a multi-step process, and there are one or more different genes responsible for each step.  Our results demonstrate that there are multiple different organisms capable of carrying out each different step in this process.  In many cases organisms that can do the same step of the process live in different parts of the water column. For example, they may have different distributions with depth, or they may be preferentially associated with large particles.  These gene distributions give us clues about the ecology of the microbes responsible for the nitrogen transformations, and thus increase our ability to predict how the magnitude of the overall process may change in a changing ocean.\n We also identified the potential for arsenic based metabolisms in zero oxygen waters.  The ability to transform arsenic for energy is thought to be ancient, but microbes with this ability are usually found in environments with relative high arsenic concentrations, such as polluted soils and mine drainage.  Their discovery in the open ocean suggests that they may have played a large role in Pre-Cambrian oceans.
