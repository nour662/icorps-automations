  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe funded research concerns several signal recovery problems occuring in X-ray crystallography, machine learning, and statistical data analysis.  Each of these problems is solved by one of many mathematical algorithms.  The X-ray crystallography task is mathematically formalized as a problem known as phase retrieval.  For this problem, the funded research found a simplification of an existing algorithm that is provably successful under a certain data model.  This algorithm affords a new way of computing solutions to the phase retrieval problem, and it inspires new algorithms for related problems.  \n\nThe machine learning and statistical data analysis problems can also be solved by one of many mathematical algorithms.  For one of these algorithms, the funded research proved that the output of the algorithm is correct under a certain data model.  This development would help scientists make a reasoned choice about which algorithm to use for understanding their particular data set.\n\nThe broader impacts of this research will likely occur in different fields of science.  For example, the algorithm for phase retrieval can inspire new methods that are adopted by practioners who design drugs.  The broader impact of the data analysis problem is the potential to allow bioinformatics researchers and other biologists to more easily understand their data.  The understanding they could gain by methods like those in this research could improve biological understanding of cancers and other conditions, permitting better treatments.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul Hand"
