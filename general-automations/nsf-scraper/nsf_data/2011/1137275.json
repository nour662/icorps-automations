 "awd_abstract_narration": "These funds support participation of graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and young\r\ninvestigators at the International Conference on Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry\r\n(ICCPB 2011), to be held in Nagoya, Japan. Participants will build world-wide connections and\r\ngain cross-cultural exposure to institutions interested in global environmental effects on animals.\r\nAdvances in understanding how animals adapt to environmental changes will support goals of\r\nsafeguarding biodiversity at all levels. Funds will support individuals who have demonstrated\r\nexceptional aptitude and potential for advancing the field of epithelial fluid and solute dynamics\r\nand its regulation. A select group of individuals will present talks in a symposium focusing on\r\nconcepts essential to understanding the role of epithelia in water and solute balance this\r\nbalance has an overarching role in maintaining all life's basic functions. Epithelia are found in all\r\norgans, and exist as sheets of cells, assembled together by precisely arranged junctional proteins\r\nthat lie between cells. Notably, the dynamics of water and solute flows through cells of the\r\nepithelial sheet are highly integrated with flows through junctions of the epithelial sheet, in a\r\nregulated, but poorly understood fashion. The symposium speakers will stress the importance of\r\nhow and why cell-to-cell contact and plasticity of these systems are fundamental to appropriate\r\ntissue water and solute dynamics for all vertebrates. Other individuals supported by this grant\r\nwill have the opportunity to present their research findings, face-to-face in poster sessions, with\r\nscientists from nearly every continent who work in widely diverse biological fields. A major goal\r\nwill be to identify and select women and individuals of underrepresented ethnic minority\r\nbackground as recipients of these travel funds. Funding for student and trainee initiatives at\r\nICCPB 2011 will play a key role in attracting and retaining the brightest and best-trained\r\ncomparative physiologists.",
