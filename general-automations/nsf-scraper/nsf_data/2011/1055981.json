 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will illuminate how deformation adjacent to the northern San Andreas Fault Zone that is sustained during earthquakes produces, over thousands to millions of years, the mountains and geologic structures that are observed along the plate boundary. Theproject will use high resolution GeoEarthScope Airborne Laser Swath Mapping and more broadly available lower resolution topography, the abundance of cosmogenic isotopes in river sands, low-temperature thermochronometry, and numerical models of crustal deformation to link earthquake-cycle and geologically-observed deformation.  The key hypotheses to be tested include: 1) While elastic and viscoelastic constitutive rules appear to well-characterize deformation during and following earthquakes, frictional failure and fatigue of crustal materials that ignored by these constitutive rules are principal contributors to the pattern of permanent deformation observed over tens of thousands to several million years; 2) Differential yielding of crustal blocks leads to large variations in deformation that accrues over thousands to millions of years; and 3) Spatial variations in the geometry of the San Andreas Fault Zone dominate the observed off-fault deformation, and result from long-term changes in plate tectonic motions and the initial configuration of geologic terranes with different constitutive properties. The results of this research will help to link the deformation observed over human time-scales to that observed in the geologic record. Additionally, the research in this proposal will serve as a springboard for improving undergraduate education, fostering graduate student and postdoctoral education and career development, providing hands-on research experience to local high-school students, training local high-school teachers to introduce students to earth sciences in the field, and constructing a real and virtual educational driving tour through the Santa Cruz Mountains that teaches the general public about the landscapes produced by plate-boundary deformation over thousands to millions of years.",

Here, a network of satellite geodetic measurements provides a dense depiction of surface motions over the last several decades, while approximately 80 years of geologic observations within the area clearly define motions along the plate margin over the last several million years. &nbsp;We supplemented these pre-existing datasets with new, state-of-the-art analyses to resolve the way in which plate motions have accrued between these vastly different time-scales.  Specifically, we first exploited new high-resolution topography to detect and delineate the location of faults within this area using a template-matching approach.  This approach was implemented on Amazon Web Services, where we could use this scaled analysis to detect and evaluate fault scarps along the entire imaged plate margin, from central California to the northern terminus of the San Andreas Fault. &nbsp;This both provided core fundamental scientific advances in the implementation and evaluation of template-matching algorithms and a complementary dataset for identifying and evaluating scarps that may be seismically hazardous.  Second, we used state-of-the-art geochemical cosmogenic radionuclide analyses to identify hot-spots of millennial time-scale uplift driven by active faults along the coast in the Peninsular Bay Area.  We then extended these analyses to the entire coastal margin of California,.  We now have constrained the erosion (and by inference uplift) of many of the coastal watersheds between Cape Mendocino at the northern termination of the San Andreas Fault and Mexico, which has provided an unprecedented depiction of uplift associated with the San Andreas Fault system. &nbsp;Third, we collected and analyzed ~50 low-temperature thermochronologic samples from the Peninsular San Andreas Fault to capture the motions between millenial and geologic time-scales along this portion of the margin.  We interpreted these data by, fourth, coupling Boundary Element Models (BEMs) representing the specific fault geometries of the area to geomorphic erosion models.  This modeling allowed us to reconcile surface motions observed by space geodesy with the several-million-year uplift of the mountains in the San Francisco Bay Area Peninsula.  Using this, we reassessed the seismic hazard potential of geologic faults that threaten Silicon Valley, California.  Finally, our modeling of these data using elasto-plastic Finite Element Models (FEMs) of the San Francisco Bay Area reconciled the geologic and geodetic observations, and shows that the lack of plastic yielding in geodetic models can explain the discordance between decadal and million-year time-scale motions.</span></p>\n<p><br /><span>The impacts of this project reach beyond the fundamental questions we have answered. &nbsp;This project has directly supported two postdoctoral scholars, four PhD dissertations, two Master?s student theses, and several undergraduate research experiences. &nbsp;It provided support for the Stanford Cosmogenic Radionuclide Target Preparation Facility, which has hosted students from a variety of local universities for sample preparation. &nbsp;It has supported a number of public outreach events, such as one Stanford Distinguished Lecture, which reached ~400 participants.
