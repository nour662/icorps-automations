 "awd_abstract_narration": "All branches of modern science demand data, and modern data acquisition technologies in biomedical research have adapted to increase the volume of data by at least three orders of magnitude in the past three decades. Much of this data is rather complex. Complex data has three properties: high volume (e.g., genome data, gigabyte per person), multimodal (e.g., Time x Genes x Control), heterogeneous (e.g., different time scales, data feeds).How these data are analyzed now presents a major challenge in scientific discovery. Although a series of powerful algorithms for statistical learning can yield accurate predictions for pattern recognition problems, the increased power of these learning algorithms has come at the expense of a considerable increase in complexity for adjusting a large number of parameters in a high dimensional space. Yet, such mathematically sound models that are computationally stable and statistically meaningful still demand more data than most biology laboratories and clinics can provide.  This workshop focus fits into the initiative between NSF and NIH to investigate developing science and technology for merging computational, physics based models with biology and medicine.  This two day workshop at RPI fits into the initiative between NSF and NIH to investigate developing science and technology for merging computational, physics based models with biology and medicine.  There will be a panel at the end of each day on a particular topic, e.g., how to integrate scales, how to deal with uncertainty and missing data, how to use data semantics in multi-scale modeling. The panel discussions will be organized into a report and will be made publicly available. The seminars and panel discussions will be recorded and made it available to public.",
