This Symposium will be held on the campus of the University of Maryland, College Park on June 19 - 24, 2011. NSF funds will provide financial support for U.S. students who contribute their work and attend the Symposium. Qualified students will be offered reduced registration fees, partial travel support, and/or oral presentation honoraria. NSF funds are targeted to increase the participation of graduate students at the meeting.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe Symposium is the world's premier fire safety science meeting and it covers every aspect of fire safety science. It has been organized every 2-3 years since 1985. The quality of accepted papers is excellent, with acceptance rates around 60%. The program will include oral presentations of peer-reviewed papers, invited lectures from the world's top fire science researchers, and work-in-progress posters. Typically 300 researchers attend this meeting and they come from over 25 different countries.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:\r\n\r\nThe Symposium is the ideal venue for student fire researchers to exchange ideas and network with their peers and with leaders in the field. It is estimated that 30 students will benefit from the proposed NSF support. The proposed support is intended to promote student participation and oral presentations at the Symposium. Targeted announcements will encourage underrepresented minorities and women to participate.",
