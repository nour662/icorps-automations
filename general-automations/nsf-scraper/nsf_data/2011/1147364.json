FOCS and its sister conference, the ACM STOC meeting, are the premier broad-based conferences on the Theory of Computing.  FOCS has a record of strongly encouraging participation by students, for whom the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides.  In recent years, the annual FOCS conference has been attended by eighty to one hundred students who have comprised more than a third of all attendees.  This award will provide partial support to twenty or more students, covering shared hotel rooms and travel.  (Student registration will be supported by other means.)",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFOCS 2011, the 52nd Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, brought together roughly 250 researchers from around the world to learn about the latest developments in theoretical computer science.  In addition to the 84 research papers selected for presentation (and publication in the FOCS 2011 conference proceedings), there were three well-attended tutorials on differential privacy, environmentally aware computing, and on fully homomorphic encryption that were aimed at a broad theoretical computer science audience.  The IEEE Edmund R. Piore Award, the top award given by the IEEE in all of\ncomputer science, was given at the conference and accompanied by an award lecture by the winner.\n\nConference attendance for FOCS 2011 included 84 students and a significant number of postdoctoral fellows.  Of these, 19 students and two post-doctoral fellows were supported by this award (including one student whose support was also supported by carry-over of funds from a separate grant for FOCS 2010).  E-mail requests for travel support for FOCS 2011 were widely solicited prior to the conference and coordinated according to the procedures on the travel support portion of the FOCS 2011 conference web page:  http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~marek/FOCS11/Student_Support/travel-support.html.  Commitments for the travel award were made several weeks in advance of the conference to enable those supported to register early at lower rates.  (Registration fees for students among those supported by this travel grant were covered by a separate amount of one-time support that the IEEE TCMF was able to secure.)   As per the conditions of the grant, travel awards were made for US institutions only.\n\nParticipation in conferences such as FOCS is one important component in the training and development of graduate students (and postdoctoral fellows) in the broad area of theoretical computer science.
