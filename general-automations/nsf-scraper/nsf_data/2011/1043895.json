 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop and use virtual reality (VR) laboratories to emulate the learning environment of physical laboratories, while preserving the three dimensionality, immersion, interactivity and hands-on data acquisition features of physical experiments.  The project team is developing the physical-to-virtual transformation methodology, integrating VR experiments in the supplementation and stand-alone modes for laboratory instruction and the embedded mode in lecture courses, and incorporating devices (such as 3-D mice, data gloves) for human-computer interfaces.   The combination of VR based practice sessions and physical experiment sessions provides students hands-on experience in both physical and virtual domains.  The pedagogical results and lessons learned from this project are disseminated through a workshop to community colleges in Virginia and a website hosting the teaching modules and project results for distribution to 4-year and 2-year colleges.",

The desk-top virtual reality (\"DTVR\") system employed a desk-top computer coupled with a 3-D flat screen digital TV to create a one screen virtual reality immersive environment. The CAVE virtual reality (\"CVR\") system employed a full-scale ( room size ) three screen projection system coupled to a computer. Assessment of these two systems, the \"DTVR\" and the \"CVR\", was done using quantitative and qualitative techniques. Statistical analysis of quiz scores of students revealed that any enhancement in quiz mean scores of students in the \"CVR\" group over students` quiz mean score of the \"DTVR\" group was statistically not significant. In other words, students` learning effectiveness was essentially the same whether they used the \"DTVR\" or the \"CVR\" system. This is a significant finding since cost of full-scale \"CVR\" system can be twenty to fifty times that of the \"DTVR\" system.\n(iii)            \nA new virtual reality system, the t..."
