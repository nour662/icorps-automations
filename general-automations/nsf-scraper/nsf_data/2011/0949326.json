 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially fund the acquisition of a new electron microprobe for the Electron Microprobe Facility in the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry at ASU, replacing our 24-year-old JEOL 8600. The new microprobe will provide a significant increase in our ability to chemically characterize microscopic samples, facilitating ongoing NSF and NASA-funded projects in fields such as geology, meteoritics, archaeology, material science, and biology. The new microprobe, with its increased capabilities, will also open up opportunities for novel research directions that are currently inaccessible with the current machine. The Electron Microprobe Facility has been a successful multi-disciplinary analytical facility at ASU for over 40 years, and has a history of strong commitment to undergraduate and graduate student training in micro-analytical techniques. This acquisition will provide broad but critical support for research programs institution-wide, as well as supporting important student training on state-of-the-art analytical equipment used by many commercial industries.",
