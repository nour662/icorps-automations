 "awd_abstract_narration": "Towson University's CoSMiC Scholars Program: Computing, Sciences, and Mathematics in College provides scholarships for meritorious undergraduate students majoring in computer science, mathematics, molecular biology, biochemistry, or bioinformatics.  The program is designed to increase awareness of the interdisciplinary nature of mathematics, computing and the sciences.  The CoSMiC Scholars Program is an extension of a previous successful S-STEM-funded program.  Scholarship recipients learn about STEM careers through interdisciplinary courses and guest lectures, field trips, and membership in and participation with a local chapter of a professional organization.  Alumni of the program mentor current scholarship recipients. The program promotes community involvement and volunteerism. \r\n \r\nThe CoSMiC Scholars Program increases the number of students pursuing degrees in the target fields and enables economically disadvantaged students to obtain a B.S. in a STEM discipline before entering the workforce or continuing their professional education. The program actively seeks out minority students and women.  In addition to recruiting and retaining students native to Towson University, the CoSMiC Scholars Program makes a special effort to include transfer students from area community colleges.",
