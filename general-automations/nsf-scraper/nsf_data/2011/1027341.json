 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Niwot (NWT) LTER project was initiated in 1980 and since then has provided experimental and observational research designed to understand the dynamics of high-elevation alpine ecosystems in North America.  The project has a history of research that has illuminated the responses of organisms and ecosystems to climate and various atmospheric inputs over the range of habitats that typify mountainous regions.  This project will continue that long-term line of research and will expand it to address: the quantity and quality of organic carbon deposition; the role of plant-soil feedbacks and environmental change in community dynamics that may include threshold effects or tipping points; the potential of biotic disturbances, such an species invasions and infectious diseases, to cause ecosystems to tip to new states and dynamics; and, development of methods and collaborations to anticipate such ecosystem shifts and to improve understanding of the social impacts of these and other perturbations to high-elevation ecosystems.  The research integrates ecological, hydrologic, geomorphic, atmospheric, and social perspectives and research techniques to understand high-elevation ecosystems and provide knowledge to manage them effectively in changing environmental and social contexts.  \r\n\r\nThis project contributes to understanding of the structure, function, and dynamics of a high-elevation ecosystem and includes development of techniques for modeling, forecasting, and better understanding such ecosystems in general. It assembles and integrates valuable long-term data sets on climate, hydrology, biology, ecology, geomorphic processes, and other elements of high-elevation ecosystems and the larger environment in which they are embedded. The project has broad societal value through its contributions to improved understanding of alpine ecosystems and their management. Its broader values also include extensive research-based training, educational program development that includes a children's book series and K-12 teacher training, and public outreach.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Mountains are among the most fragile environments on Earth. While majestic and seemingly mighty, they habitats they host are characterized by organisms evolved to cope with short growing seasons, intense winters, sparse vegetation, and thin soils. The fact that many organisms on mountains are specialized for life in an extreme place and that they are isolated on their mountaintops with very few options for moving to a new habitat, makes us predict that they would be especially vulnerable to sudden ecological disturbance. Mountain slopes, which often have variable terrain and geological features, offer many micro-habitats to shelter biodiversity. The Rocky Mountains of Western North America collect a reservoir of snow each winter, they influence the weather of the plains around them, and they provide many ecosystem goods and services on which downstream communities rely. Niwot Ridge was established as a site in the Long-Term Ecological Research Program in 1980. Located approximately 35 km west of Boulder, Colorado, our site encompasses extensive alpine tundra, glacial lakes, cirques and talus slopes, all above 3000 m elevation. The Niwot Ridge LTER VI grant focused on the tight relationship between climate (as measured through data on temperature, snowfall, rainfall, and other variables) and &ldquo;ecosystem processes&rdquo; in mountain systems. Our researchers asked questions like: which species are where? Have they moved? Are they thriving? How is their presence/absence related to changes in climate variables? How is permafrost and ice on lakes and in glaciers changing? How has the timing of snow melt changed and how does that timing impact everything from plant species diversity to the communities of microbes in the soils? We also investigated how pollution influences soils and plant communities in alpine habitats by measuring nitrogen levels. Chemically reactive nitrogen (as opposed to the inert nitrogen normally found in the air we breathe) is a prevalent by-product of burning fossil fuels and of fertilizers spread in agricultural areas. When this Nitrogen gets washed out of the air into the soil and then into waterways, it can form nitric acid, which can be detrimental for plants and animals, and it&rsquo;s well demonstrated that reactive nitrogen levels at Niwot have been increasing for decades.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the most important findings of this research has been to document how differently different species respond to changes in climate. Despite strong increasing trends in temperature, CO<sub>2</sub>, N and dust deposition (dust from agriculture and urban development can fall on snow in the winter and drive earlier snow melt and a decrease in snow pack), there are species that are coping well and taking advantage of new conditions to expand their ranges. For example, we documented tundra vegetation spreading into areas that were previously barren. This was facilitated by warmer temperatures extending the growing season for tundra plants. However, hotter, drier summers aren&rsquo;t good for everyone&mdash;forest trees in the subalpine seem to be more vulnerable to drought stress, disease, and fire. And some of our most specialized species are altogether failing to keep up with the pace of change. American Pikas in the Niwot Ridge region are showing signs of physiological stress that lead to death as sub-surface ice layers melt, perhaps because this ice insulates them from extreme temperatures in the winter and may also help them avoid predators.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to doing research, our team took time to do a variety of outreach and education work. In addition to bringing hundreds of children, teachers, and members of the general public to Niwot Ridge to see our science in action, we brought our Schoolyard Book, My Water Comes from the Rocky/San Juan Mountains, across the state of Colorado. We partnered with nine educational organizations and two school districts in the Front Range and Four Corners regions of Colorado to link our research to K-12 curricula. The books and associated classroom and teacher professional development curricula reached an estimated 15,000 children and 90 teachers. In Boulder County, several of the most popular components of the My Water curriculum have been adapted to be included in a kit designed for teaching about weather and the water cycle which was used for several years by every 5th grade science classroom in the Boulder Valley School District. Our schoolyard LTER program was also enhanced by online curricula about hydrology and pika biology, available to teachers worldwide via <a href=\"http://www.Science-Live.org\">www.Science-Live.org</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/23/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Katharine&nbsp;N&nbsp;Suding</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1027341/1027341_10074015_1521825649345_Aug062015_0907_edited-1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1027341/1027341_10074015_1521825649345_Aug062015_0907_edited-1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"High school students study subalpine forest ecology\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1027341/1027341_10074015_1521825649345_Aug062015_0907_edited-1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"High school students study subalpine forest ecology\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Studying subalpine forest ecology and the role of fire and disease as part of the Mountain Research Experience for high school students hosted by the Mountain Research Station and LTER personnel.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alex Rose</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katharine&nbsp;N&nbsp;Suding</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">High school students study subalpine forest ecology</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1027341/1027341_10074015_1521825510150_Fig16--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1027341/1027341_10074015_1521825510150_Fig16--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"High school students participate in NWT research\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1027341/1027341_10074015_1521825510150_Fig16--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"High school students participate in NWT research\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Each summer, High School students spend a week at the Mountain Research Station doing research with LTER scientists.
