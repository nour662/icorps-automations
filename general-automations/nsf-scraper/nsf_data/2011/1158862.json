This partnership is designed to foster collaborative research, and to stimulate multidisciplinary education through four centers. Each center is designed to support and train new faculty, staff, and students in key nano- and biotechnology innovation areas aligned with the state?s economic development priorities outlined in the governor?s ?Plan 2010?.\r\n\r\nProject Major Foci: The Tuskegee University led center will develop and characterize new  biodegradable nanostructured materials; the Auburn University led center will use organismal models to identify mechanisms of adaptation to natural and man-made environmental challenges; the University of Alabama in Birmingham led center will develop new optical and molecular sensing technologies; and the Alabama A&M University led center will use nanopatterning and nanofabrication techniques to control structure-property relationships in order to tailor materials properties for specific applications. An additional role of this center will be the integration of the findings of each center to catalyze innovation based economic development. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe centers will ensure reciprocal transfer of information and technology between the life sciences and engineering to catalyze novel research in both fields. Biological discovery will elucidate structural and functional principles in living systems that can serve as templates for pioneering the design and synthesis of nanomaterials. Likewise, advances in nanoscale detection, quantification, and nanoengineering will open new frontiers in the life sciences. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe centers will establish statewide infrastructure that will foster collaboration, build partnerships, develop future STEM-enabled workforce, improve scientific literacy, and develop new economic opportunities. The centers research will likely have a major impact on the environment, homeland security, and industrial process control.\r\n\r\n",

These activities were carried out at Tuskegee University (TU, lead), Alabama A &amp; M University (AAMU), Auburn University (AU), University of Alabama (UA), University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), University of Alabama Huntsville (UAH), and the University of South Alabama (USA). &nbsp;Five junior faculty members received program funds to kick-start their research activities, in addition to the numerous junior faculty members who worked directly in association with the thrust leads. The <strong>Nano and Biomaterials </strong>Research Thrust centered on development of new nanostructured materials with enhanced thermal, physical, mechanical, and biodegradable properties; synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials for drug delivery applications; and advanced green composites. The <strong>Biotechnology </strong>Research Thrust served as the life sciences discovery arm of the program, focused on developing and using organismal models to identify mechanisms of adaptation to natural and man-made environmental challenges that enabled development and testing of nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, such as exosomes for drug delivery and nanomaterial scaffolds for tissue regeneration. The <strong>Optics and Sensors </strong>Research Thrust was involved in research into a wide range of new spectroscopy-based tools for analysis of organic and inorganic materials. These activities included development of the necessary broadly tunable mid-infrared laser sources, development of the spectroscopy platforms that separate and analyze the spectral signatures, and nonlinear optical methods for protection of optical sensors.&nbsp; The <strong>Nanofabrication </strong>Research Thrust applied cutting-edge nanoengineering to develop molecular sensors, regimented nanomaterials and nanostructures with applications in chemical, biological, and thermo-electric devices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Broader Impact:&nbsp; </em></strong>RII activities involved over 70 faculty members, 15% of who were female and over 30% minority.
