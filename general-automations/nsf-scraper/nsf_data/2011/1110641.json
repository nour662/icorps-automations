 "awd_abstract_narration": "Like most mammals, leaf-nosed bats use their noses in respiration (breathing) and olfaction (smelling). Unlike most mammals, however, these animals also use their noses to transmit echolocation calls. Each of these three functions requires space and connectivity within the relatively small nasal cavity. As a first step toward understanding the potential trade-offs in the evolution of these functions, this study seeks to understand how the morphology of the nasal cavity relates to olfaction in particular. Drawing on a diverse array of classic and cutting-edge anatomical techniques (comparative anatomy, histology, micro-CT scanning, and computational fluid dynamics), this research takes a multidisciplinary approach to understanding how form relates to function across evolutionary time in a sample of 14 species of bats. \r\nThis research will lead to a better understanding of functional trade-offs in the evolution of complex systems. Questions about the relationship between form and function have a long history in evolutionary biology, and this research will make significant contributions to understanding the form-function relationship in an understudied region of the skull. As part of this research, undergraduates will be trained in generating and testing hypotheses, gathering anatomical data, and interpreting results. CT scans and computational models will be disseminated to other scientists and to the public through online databases.",
