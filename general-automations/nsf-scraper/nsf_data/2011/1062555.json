NSF funds will be used for partial support for student registration and partial cost of conference publications and dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe conference brings students, engineers, scientists, and industry leaders in biomedical engineering to disseminate information in this rapidly growing field. It provides a multidisciplinary educational forum to discuss new ideas and concepts, covering a broad range of topics in biomedical engineering including the full range from clinical to basic science. Most significantly, it encourages and facilitates student attendance by encouraging student paper submittal, holding a student paper competition, and subsidizing student registration fees. The intellectual merit and broader impact of this project are as follows. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit ? The field of Biomedical Engineering is rapidly evolving. The Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference provides the means for individuals to promote and disseminate advances they have made, subject to peer and professional critique. The gathering is a most valuable venue for discussing new directions, ideas, and approaches for research and education. They also aid both in reinforcing contacts and collaborations and establishing new ones. While SBEC draws heavily from institutions and organizations in the South, Southwest, and Southeast regions of the US, many from outside of the region and even other countries have actively participated in this conference. Hence, it is most conducive for enhancement and elevation of knowledge of biomedical engineering. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact ? This is beneficial to all attendees but particularly important for students and young investigators. Indeed, the conference?s emphasis on students encourages them to be actively involved, not just by attending, but by participating and contributing to the conference through their individual presentations. It is important to note that some of the organizers of recent SBEC conferences did their very first conference presentation at SBEC when they were doctoral students or young assistant professors. Hence, the conference will bring the opportunity to learn, teach, and establish collaborations to the broad audience of students as well as established researchers and professionals.",
