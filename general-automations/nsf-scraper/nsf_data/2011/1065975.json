This meeting is the joint meeting of the Global Design Effort (GDE) and the physics and detector community, led by the American Linear Collider Physics Group (ALCPG). The event will include plenary and parallel sessions covering topics of importance to accelerator and detector development as well as physics results from the LHC. Attendance by junior members of the community is a priority for this meeting. Requests for financial support will be solicited from young scientists throughout the United States. A committee of senior scientists will review and select the most promising young candidates, paying close attention to diversity and providing opportunities for under-represented groups.",

This precision is necessary to fully understand the role of any new physics discoveries in the theoretical framework of particle physics. The possible physics topics include the origin of mass and electroweak symmetry breaking (such as the Higgs boson or bosons), new particle states related to dark matter (such as Neutralinos), or other new particle discoveries from a variety of fundamental origins.\n\n \n\nThe Linear Collider Workshop of the Americas was held on the campus of the University of Oregon, March 19-23, 2011 to take stock of recent progress in the planning of the linear collider.\n\n \n\nThis NSF grant provided travel support for a selected group of twelve young scientists, to enable them to participate in the workshop.\n\n \n\nThis joint meeting of the Global Design Effort (GDE) and the physics and detector community, led by the American Linear Collider Physics Group (ALCPG), provided an excellent opportunity for young scientist to engage with more senior members of the field in technical activities.

This important meeting, attended by about 200 members of the international community, followed the sequence of recent meetings on this work in Albuquerque (Sep 2009), Beijing (March 2010), and Geneva (Oct 2010).\n\n \n\nFollowing a review of applications from young scientists by a committee of senior scientists, the most promising young candidates were selected for support.  Thirteen applications were selected.  One awardee declined, resulting in twelve awards.\n\nThese young scientists engaged fully in the workshop, including as speakers for the following presentations:\n\n \n\nRiccardo Abbate, MIT, \"Precision Extraction of alpha_s in SCET,\" Top, QCD, Loopverien Session;\n\n \n\nBurak Bilki, U. Iowa, \"Positron and pion responses in the DHCAL,\" Calorimetry Session;\n\n \n\nChristoph Englert, Heidelberg University, \"WZ+jet, Wgamma+jet with anomalous couplings,\" Top, QCD, Loopverien Session;\n\n \n\nGarabed Halladjian, U.

Iowa, \"Status of UIPFA,\" Simulation and Reconstruction Session.\n\n \n\nA public event, \"The Particle Physics Slam\" was held during the workshop.  One of the supported young scientists participated as a contestant in this very popular event.  About eight hundred of the local community came out to hear seven physicists each describe an aspect of modern particle physics.  The individual presentations were followed by a lively question and answer forum that lasted for about one hour.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/25/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James E Brau"
