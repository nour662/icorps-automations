 "awd_abstract_narration": "The videographers intend to produce a film that reveals the challenges and obstacles of the extremes of life at Antarctic research stations with those experienced by young people who live in the inner cities of the United States. \r\n\r\nCombining interviews conducted at McMurdo and Amundsen-Scott South Pole stations with interviews done in the U.S. cities, the filmmakers hope to bring to light the commonalities of survival strategies in these two very different, but challenging environments.\r\n\r\nThey will use their experiences in Antarctica to draw out students in interviews at schools in Detroit and Los Angeles, to talk about and contrast their fears, the hazards, and challenges in their urban surroundings, while revealing the universality of the human spirit. An exhibition of photographs will augment the film, capturing candid portraits of the film?s subjects, and be useful for producing and promoting the film. \r\n\r\nThrough collaboration with inner-city schools the film will open avenues of discourse and learning with young people far removed?physically, intellectually, economically, and emotionally?from the Antarctic. The project also offers a new approach to understanding Antarctica, its residents and its microculture. \r\n\r\n",
