 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solving environmental issues such as global climate change requires new ways to understand the biosphere, and for much greater engagement between ecosystem scientists and the public. However, the current academic system does not reward, and sometimes penalizes, such activities. Academic scientists only rarely connect to those who have little access to science (e.g., people in assisted living centers, urban youth, or incarcerated people).\r\n\r\nA pilot study suggested that scientists who engage with scientifically unaware audiences can generate new ideas, implement research, communicate results, and inspire ecological understanding in ways they could not if they were restricted to academic interactions or worked only with traditional public audiences. This proposed project explores a high-risk/potential high- return approach to create a rigorous, creative, sustainable, and transformative program to change public outreach from burden to benefit. \r\n\r\nWorking with a team of professional evaluators, the PI will gather well-established and early career ecosystem ecologists as \"Research Ambassadors\" (RAs) to engage scientifically unaware audiences via lectures, research projects, and websites. They will: a) brainstorm with appropriate public audiences whose interests overlap with the RAs'; b) provide guidance on outreach activities; and c) evaluate effects on the scientists and their science, as well as the public audiences.\r\n\r\nThis is a first systematic effort to provide a sustainable outreach program for senior and junior ecosystem scientists and to understand the impacts of public engagement on them. The results for ecosystem science can extend to other fields of science in the future.\r\n\r\nResearch Ambassadors will create materials and projects for underserved public audiences that are often disproportionately weighted toward minorities. This work will set the stage for large numbers of scientists to understand that contact with these audiences can bring academic and societal rewards.",

We recruited and guided ecologists from an R1 Research university to understand the values and rewards of carrying out public engagement of their own research.

Over 100 scientists have been included in public engagement events, and these have produced more than 250 outreach events, mainly in Utah, Washington State, and in other states across the country.&nbsp;These events have involved \"science-inattentive\" public audiences (those who are unaware or hostile to science (e.g., policy-makers, faith-based groups), or who do not have access to science education (e.g., prisoners), community groups that are often overlooked in traditional formal and informal science education efforts. One of our foci was to bring ecology and environmental sciences to a particularly underserved public audience, incarcerated men and women in state prisons and jails. We built on the \"Sustainability in Prisons Project\" (SPP) that the PI co-founded in Washington State in 2005, and with an NSF Conference grant (2013-2015), the project leaders created the SPP Network, a group of ca. 25 prisons and academic institutions that bring science lectures and ecology/conservation projects to prisoners. Specifically, the PI started an \"SPP node\" in Utah (Draper State Prison and Salt Lake County Jail). To date, 24 environmental scientists have delivered lectures about their work to inmates, and 4 have participated in hands-on conservation projects. We also created links between ecologists and other public groups who tend to have little interest in science.
