 "awd_abstract_narration": "Curricular materials for undergraduate education in chemical measurement and instrumentation science are being developed and implemented by faculty members at 20 public and private doctoral-granting, predominantly undergraduate, and minority-serving institutions.  This includes three historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and one hispanic-serving institution (HIS).  The materials are inquiry- and problem-based modules on measurement techniques and methods.  Integrative contextual modules that use measurement techniques and methods in the context of a larger scientific question or problem are being developed as well.  Modules are designed to be used in a variety of formats (e.g., classroom activity, homework assignment, laboratory project) and modified to suit the particular needs of an instructor or institution. Many of the materials are designed to be undertaken by students working interactively in small groups.  Faculty teaching expertise and student-learning outcomes are being expanded and improved at the institutions involved in this project.  Over 900 students a year benefit by developing their ability to solve problems, work independently, and think critically.  A workshop is being offered for faculty members at HBCUs and HSIs to develop faculty expertise in the use of the inquiry-based electronic resources and promote the utilization of the materials outside the project development team.  The materials developed in this project are being disseminated through the NSF-funded Analytical Sciences Digital Library (ASDL), http://www.asdlib.org/, an open-access, peer-reviewed and annotated collection of electronic resources on chemical measurements and instrumentation for students, instructors, and practitioners of the analytical sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne goal of this project was to develop active learning materials for use in the undergraduate analytical chemistry classroom and laboratory.  There are very few active learning resources available to instructors of these courses.  All of the materials developed in the project are free to instructors throughout the world under the Creative Commons Copyright.  The materials are available on the Active Learning Site of the Analytical Sciences Digital Library (ASDL).   Funding for the routine maintenance of ASDL is provided by the Analytical Division of the American Chemical Society. \n\nA project team consisting of 23 faculty members from a range of institution types within the United States developed eleven in-class curriculum modules, six contextual modules, and five laboratory activities.  Most of these modules consist of multicomponent activities that in the aggregate, cover almost all the topics that are usually taught in undergraduate analytical chemistry courses.  Instructors can use an entire module or more likely modify a portion of the entire module for use in a course.  The project team also developed a wide variety of textual materials to augment the modules.  These textual materials, which are also free to anyone, cover the entirety of topics typically covered in undergraduate chemistry courses.\n\nAnother goal of the project was to encourage more analytical chemistry instructors to use active learning in their classrooms and laboratories.  Professional development activities on the effective use of active learning were held for the 23 faculty participants at our yearly curriculum development workshops.  In addition, we offered two workshops for faculty members at historically Black and Hispanic-serving institutions.  These workshops were attended by a total of 52 different faculty members.  The 75 faculty members directly impacted by the project teach a total of over 3,000 students each year in their courses. \n\nAssessment data collected from faculty participants indicate significant improvements in student learning outcomes.  Many participants also noted significant improvements in student course evaluations after introducing active learning into the classroom and/or laboratory. \n\nA final goal was to disseminate the outcomes of the project to faculty members beyond those who had participated in the module development or two workshops.  The intent was to encourage more instructors to use active learning and to use curricular materials available on the ASDL site.  We organized a symposium each year of the project at either a national meeting of the American Chemical Society, the Pittsburgh Conference (the largest conference devoted exclusively to analytical chemistry), or the Pacifichem Conference.  Members of the development team and participants at one of our workshops gave several of the talks at these sessions.  We held several invited active learning workshops at specific institutions.  We held a number of networking sessions on active learning at the Pittsburgh Conference.  We published a number of articles that described curriculum materials and active learning outcomes developed through the project.  Members of the curriculum development team gave over 100 presentations at conferences on outcomes of the project.  At these various activities we keep encountering analytical chemistry instructors who mention their use of materials from the ASDL site in their courses.  We are encouraged that this project is having a positive impact on the community.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas J Wenzel"
