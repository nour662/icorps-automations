Plant viruses in the families, Luteoviridae, Nanoviridae, and Geminiviridae, cause diseases with serious economic consequences in many staple food crops in Sub-Saharan Africa and a majority are transmitted aphids and whiteflies in a circulative, persistent manner. Cultural and chemical control strategies, aimed at reducing or avoiding infection, can be effective; however, their success is dependent upon knowledge of the population dynamics of the insect vectors, including their efficiency to transmit viruses. This is challenging because populations of insects, even within the same species, vary widely in their efficiency of virus transmission making targeted management strategies nearly impossible. Recently several protein biomarkers were identified that distinguish aphid populations capable of transmitting these circulating viruses from those that are incapable of transmitting the virus. This project will determine if these biomarkers can be used to identify vector competent populations of other aphid and whitefly species that transmit similar circulating viruses affecting a wide range staple food crops in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere in the world. If common or species-specific biomarkers are identified, they can be used to rapidly identify those insect populations that are efficient virus vectors and target them for application of virus disease management strategies. Targeted vector control will reduce the unnecessary application of pesticides and other crop inputs. In many cases the insects that are not vectors of viruses are not injurious to overall crop health. \r\n\r\nThis targeted approach will help to minimize virus transmission within and between cropping systems, and will disproportionately benefit the resource poor, food insecure nations. The judicious use of crop inputs based on risk information rather than continual prophylactic applications has economic, environmental and health benefits.  Indeed, a targeted approach to integrated pest management has the potential to provide farmers with the best form of plant virus protection: early and fast detection of vector species and avoidance of infection. The project will focus on solving the key technology components necessary to give smallholder farmers access to advanced approaches for the control of insects that transmit some of the most economically devastating plant viruses. Outreach and education components are focused on implementing a pipeline for the eventual deployment of a field-based assay in Africa to target the most important insect vector species. All of the biological information generated from virus transmission assays and gene sequencing will be made available to the scientific community through publications, long-term repositories (NCBI, USDA-ARS) and project websites and directly to integrated pest management (IPM) and agricultural stakeholders at conferences.  Data will be compiled into a handbook for smallholder farmers for rapid dissemination throughout Africa via IITA extension specialists.  All raw mass spectrometry data files, Skyline documents, MS/MS spectrum libraries, and refined targeted proteomics instrument methods generated using Skyline will be available at http://proteome.gs.washington.edu.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe many species of plant viruses within the Luteoviridae, Geminiviridae and Nanoviridae are all transmitted by phloem feeding insect vectors in a circulative manner.  The precise route of virus movement through the vector can differ across and within virus families, but these viruses all share many biological, biochemical and ecological features.  All share temporal and spatial constraints with respect to transmission efficiency.  The viruses also induce physiological changes in their plant hosts resulting in behavioral changes in the insects that optimize the transmission of virus to new hosts.  Virus proteins interact with insect, endosymbiont and plant proteins to orchestrate directly and indirectly virus movement in insects and plants to facilitate transmission.  Knowledge of these complex interactions allows for the development of new tools to reduce or prevent transmission, to quickly identify important vector populations, and to improve the management of these economically important viruses affecting agricultural and natural plant populations.  All activities on our project centered on developing an understanding of the relationship among plants, insects, and the plant pathogens transmitted by insects.  Our research has revealed insect and endosymbiont proteins that can readily identify efficient vector populations of aphids and whiteflies, two of the most numerous and serious insect vectors of plant pathogens.  Molecular studies showed high levels of conservation of these proteins in a variety of different aphid and whitefly species collected from the field.  Studies revealed insect-virus protein interactions required for movement within insect vector tissues and the contribution of plant phloem proteins to the virus transmission by insect vectors.  Work with whiteflies showed the contribution of commensal bacteria that live within the insect vector to the ability of these insects to transmit plant viruses.  This research project paved the way for the development of highly targeted control strategies developed to block very specific molecular events key to virus transmission by insects.  This project was conducted in collaboration with partners at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Nigeria and Cameroon and the Volcani Center in Israel.  Five graduate students and two postdoctoral associates hailing from Nigeria, Cameroon, Israel and the United States were trained during the project.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/13/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stewart M Gray"
