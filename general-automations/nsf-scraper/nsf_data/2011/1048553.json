 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor Carol Korzeniewski and colleagues Christopher Bradley, Dominick Casadonte, Michael Mayer and William Nes from Texas Tech University will acquire a cyber-enabled premium-shielded 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) development of cobalt catalysts for hydrocarbon activation/functionalization, (b) photochemical studies of metal phenanthroline-based molecular assemblies, (c) synthetic, structural and reactivity studies on zwitterionic metal silanides, siloxides and silane dendrimers, (d) development of neuropeptide mimics and enantioselective synthesis using chiral N-phosphonyl imines, (e) preparation of mechanically interlocked polymeric materials, and (f) studies to unravel sterol biosynthesis.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to follow the progress of chemical reactions, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solids and in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to carry out frontier chemistry related research and to train students in modern research techniques. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact on organic, materials, electronics and bioorganic chemistry research. The resources will be used not only for research activities but also for research training of undergraduate and graduate students including those from underrepresented groups.",
