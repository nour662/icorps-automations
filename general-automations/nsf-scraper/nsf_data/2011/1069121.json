 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamism of the U.S. economy has been fueled with continued advances in basic and applied science, conducted within both academic and industry boundaries.  Underlying these critical macro (institutional and national policy) level factors are individual decisions made by the scientists themselves, as they choose among careers options that relate to what they do:  basic or applied science; and where they do it:  academia or industry. An understanding of these micro level factors is necessary to formulate an individual career strategy, to strengthen the competitiveness of both firms and universities and to design sound economic policies\r\n\r\nThis proposal examines the micro factors related to scientific labor markets that influence institutional and policy issues. It is based on the premise that societal goals related to achieving an optimal level of basic and applied research can be best achieved by creating the appropriate incentive structure that provides for an optimal matching of scientists to careers in basic and/or applied science, within academic or industry settings.  The research develops new theoretical models that build on matching, human capital and endogenous growth theory, and new empirical evidence using panel data on baccalaureate and doctoral graduates in science and engineering fields from Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) developed by the NSF. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:  The research provides a new framework to identify roles of preference, ability, job characteristics, and institutional settings in career choices and the career trajectory of scientists by combining a matching model and a human capital model. The interaction of individual and institutional characteristics is explicitly entered into a model and empirically tested to understand its impacts on individual choices and performances as well as on the entire market or economy. The research also offers new perspectives and a new micro-foundation for endogenous economic growth models by emphasizing interactions and synergies between basic and applied science. In particular, the framework in the research helps identify sources of economic growth that the linear model has failed to recognize. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The research informs existing and prospective scientists embarking on alternative careers and seeking collaborations with others or acquiring their own complementary skills.  It informs universities and firms of sources of synergies between basic and applied science, and helps them design an incentive scheme and an institutional arrangement for attracting and retaining innovative personnel, as well as extracting the benefits of science.",

Using data available from the NSF Scientists and Engineers Statistical data System (SESTAT), the study finds that career paths are not strictly orthogonal.  More than 21 percent of scientists who have academic positions focus on applied science; on the other hand, 13 percent of those with jobs in industry focus on basic science. \n\nWe found that young scientists and engineers with \"a preference for non-monetary returns\" tend to choose academic jobs over industry jobs, but not necessarily to choose basic science over applied science.  Ability is another factor in this sorting, with higher ability researchers choosing basic over applied research if they are in academic jobs, but not necessarily doing so if they are in industry jobs.  Moreover, researchers doing these two types of work are much more likely to collaborate with one another if they are in industry jobs than if they are in academic ones.  The research suggests that policies to better support young researchers making career choices, and to break down academic silos, would be beneficial.\n\nFurther, the research shows earnings are typically lower in academia than in industry in part because there is a higher preference for non-monetary returns among academic researchers.  Also earnings diverge between basic and applied researchers in academia, but are very similar in industry.\n\nIn terms of intellectual merit, the project provides a better modeling of the labor markets in science by incorporating matching theory into traditional life cycle models of human capital investments.The model builds from the differences in the scientific production functions in academia and industry: basic scientists may work independently of applied scientists in academia, but have to work closely with applied scientists in industry.
