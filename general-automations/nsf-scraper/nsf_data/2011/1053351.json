While the scales are different, the deep geologic past provides test cases against which climate models can be compared or from which they can be created.  However, spatial coverage by paleoclimate proxies is best for middle latitudes, and quite limited for the tropics and subtropics, especially in the terrestrial realm. This project will investigate a new extraordinary Early Miocene (22 Ma) site where carbonaceous shales and tuffaceous sediments preserve lagerst\u00e4tten-quality fossils including abundant compressed leaves, fruits and seeds with exquisite cuticular features, complete frogs with both skeletal and soft body parts, fish and large mammal bones. These enable reconstruction of paleoclimate, pCO2, paleoecology, and significant biogeographic data for African flora, and perhaps fauna.  The objectives of this project are to:\r\n1.\tcompare Early Miocene and Late Oligocene paleoclimate, paleoecology, and biogeography using multiple independent proxies.\r\n2.\tprovide pCO2 estimates from pedogenic goethite and stomatal indices.\r\n3.\tprovide Early Miocene paleoecological and paleoclimatological context for faunal evolution during an otherwise poorly known, but significant time interval for Africa. \r\n4.\taddress plant biogeographic questions, e.g. a decline in palm richness and importance\r\n5.\ttest methods by (a) comparing &#948;D isotopes from aquatic and terrestrial lipids to test for enrichment of D due to evapotranspiration, (b) comparing goethite and stomatal index pCO2 data (c) evaluating the consistency of paleotemperature and precipitation reconstructions using methods based upon leaf physiognomy, overlapping ranges of plant taxa, qualitative and quantitative paleosol analyses, and multiple isotope geochemical proxies. \r\nNon-technical Description and Broader Significance: This grant funds a multidisciplinary team of scientists who will sample rocks and fossils from the Ethiopian Plateau northeast of Addis Ababa to reconstruct past climate, vegetation, atmospheric CO2 concentration (pCO2), and the physical landscape 22 million years ago in an integrated and collaborative way. Team members, who have collaborated before on rocks from the Plateau that are 27 million years old, have expertise in the study of plant fossil identification, insect damage to fossil leaves, the reconstruction of past climate and ecology, the geochemistry of ancient soils and organic plant compounds, and geology. The locality preserves extraordinary plant fossils having cellular detail, smaller vertebrates including frogs with soft tissue preservation, and large mammal bones.  The scientific significance of our work is that it will resolve currently conflicting data regarding global temperature and pCO2 between 27 million and 22 million years ago.  Marine records show a significant rise in global temperature between these times, but some records of pCO2 show a decline and others a rise.  Resolution of this conflict by acquisition of temperature and pCO2 data from one region using multiple independent sources will tell us if our understanding of CO2, in relation to global temperature is correct.  Furthermore, the modern land connection between Africa and Eurasia was established about 24 million years ago, so we will be able to compare the younger plant and animal fossils with those from a time prior to contact with Eurasia.  Africa?s flora and fauna was in a period of transition at this time, and its documentation is important for understanding the origins of modern biomes. \r\nEducational outreach includes distance learning for thousands of K-12 students.  This team has a history of blogs, currently hosted by the SMU Public Affairs office on the main website, and recently through the NY Times Scientist at Work pages. Students will be an integral part of this project ? this team has regularly taken students into the field and will continue to do so.  We also plan to host an Ethiopian graduate student for training in the U.S.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAfrican humid forests today are largely confined to an equatorial band in the central and western portion of the continent, but they once covered much of East Africa.  This project aimed to characterize the vegetation and climate of one of these lost forests from 22 million year old Miocene fossils preserved the Mush Valley of Ethiopia.  To do this, we examined the morphological and chemical signatures of fossilized leaves, and used these features to reconstruct the forest structure and climate.\n\nThis research involved collecting fossils from the Mush Valley in Ethiopia, developing a method for isolating fossil leaves for isotopic analysis, analyzing the isotopic signature of fossilized leaf tissue and leaf waxes, and comparing these chemical signatures to morphological features of the same leaves. \n\nThe isotopic and morphological features measured in the fossil leaves reveal that, in the Miocene, the Mush fossil site was a tropical rainforest that would have connected what are now only remnant patches of rainforest.  In addition, the comparison of different measures of forest structure, namely foliar carbon isotope ratios and undulation index, indicate that additional research is needed to disentangle the sensitivities of each measure to light. The carbon and hydrogen isotopic ratios of leaf waxes from the Mush Valley indicate heterogeneous hydroclimatic conditions across the landscape 22 million years ago that can be linked with the floras at each of the localities. \n\nThe project delivered several methodological advances in the use of chemical and morphological features of fossil leaves for paleoecology.  Methods were developed for the sampling of fossil leaves for isotopic and molecular characterization that screen for contamination from the sedimentary matrix and that can be applied to other fossil studies.  Furthermore, the comparison of carbon isotope ratios and undulation index values from the same leaves provides a substantive advance in our understanding on the environmental controls on these measures of forest structure. \n\nThe broader impacts of this research were to support three promising early career female academics, strengthen research collaborations between Ethiopian and US researchers, and improve our understanding of the interaction between climate and ecosystem change. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Francesca A Mcinerney"
