 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a new vanadium dioxide-based focal planar array technology capable of achieving resolution and sensitivity levels that are beyond the theoretical limits of current focal planar array technologies. The approach is to integrate vanadium dioxide thin films with silicon cantilevers and test arrays of such devices in an optical readout system to be assembled. \r\nRecent discoveries show that vanadium dioxide-coated silicon cantilevers show an abrupt and large bending during the coating?s phase transition. This phenomenon will be applied to infrared sensing technologies. The preliminary work shows that by utilizing this actuation mechanism, an approximately 6-fold increase in sensitivity over the theoretical sensitivity limits of current technologies ? based on thermal expansion coefficient of bimorph cantilevers ? is possible. The thin vanadium dioxide films did not cause bending of the coated cantilevers at room temperature, which eliminates issues related to the flatness of the bimorph cantilevers currently used. This transformative work unveils a new technology that could impact other areas such as micro-electro-mechanical actuators. \r\nThe broader impacts of this work can be found in the development of a new technology for infrared sensing, that offers resolutions and sensitivities unachievable at the current state-of-the-art. The development of this technology at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez will impact participant undergraduate and graduate students in this institution, since it will give them the opportunity to be part of this technology development and have hands-on experience in cleanroom technologies for the first time.",

Although there are many contributions to the scientific and general community that were made possible thorugh this grant, the major outcomes of this NSF CAREER award can be summarized in the following:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Discovery of a new operation principle for MEMS</strong>: MEMS have been typically driven by electrostatic or magnetic forces. MEMS actuators, had heavily relied on bimorph actuation, where the thermal expansion coefficient difference between two materials was the responsible for generating movement. We were able to demosntrate a new operation principle that was based on the phase-change of a thin film coating on the MEMS structural material. When VO<sub>2</sub> thin film coatings transitioned through their phase change, they generated stress levels in the structural material that produced mechanical deflections with larger energy densities than any other mechanism.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. <strong>VO<sub>2</sub>-based MEMS</strong>: VO<sub>2</sub> is not a CMOS compatible material, which makes its integration in MEMS a challenge. Typical actuation of VO<sub>2</sub>-based microdevices relied on the use of hybrid approaches, where the VO<sub>2</sub> film deposiiton and processing was done separately from the MEMS device. For the first time, VO<sub>2</sub> thin films were integrated in fully monolithic MEMS devices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Programmable MEMS</strong>: Due to the hysteresis in VO<sub>2</sub>, the developed VO<sub>2</sub>-based MEMS actuators were also used to program mecahnical states by using solely electrical signals. The observed changes in deflection of an actuator enabled the demonstration of a micromanipulator --which was used for micro-assembly-- and changes in stress allowed for programmable resonant frequencies in MEMS --which demosntrated tuning ranges larger than what had been achieved before using other more complicated techniques and fabrication processes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Multifunctional MEMS</strong>: Many of the VO<sub>2</sub> properties change abruptly across the phase transition, including optical, electrical, and mechanical. We demonstrated multi-functional programmable micro-devices, where the electrical and optical properties were tuned and programmed by using current pulses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. I<strong>nfrared Projector:</strong> By using the programmable capability of the optical properties of VO<sub>2</sub>, we demonstrated an infrared projector. A laser was scanned over the surface of a VO<sub>2</sub> thin film, inducing the phase change in the scanned regions. The scanned areas had a different optical transmissivity, which allowed for the programming and projection of infrared images.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6. <strong>Self-sensing</strong>: Since VO<sub>2</sub> is a strongly correlated material, all the changes in its properties across the phase transition are coupled. We used this to demonstrate devices where the change in one property (for example, resistance) can be used to predict the optical (for example, transmittance) and mechanical properties (for example, deflection). This technique eliminates the need of external equiment, which typically induce losses in the system and require/consume external power.</p>\n<p>7.<strong> Broadening participation</strong>: This grant has supported 3 M.S. degrees at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, and 3 Ph.D. degrees at Michigan State University (6 total). <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">All</span> students were Hispanic, and one was female.
