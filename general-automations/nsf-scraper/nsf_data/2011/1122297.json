 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops and uses mathematical tools to study the dynamics of a variety of cellular physiological processes.   The specific  projects include a study to better understand how the electrical signal that coordinates cardiac activity is transmitted from cell to cell, including the effects of ephaptic coupling; how random fluctuations of ion channels can lead to spontaneous electrical activity in nerves; how dividing cells coordinate the separation of  their duplicated chromosomes; how proteins are made, sorted into vesicles, transported and processed, (recycled or destroyed) in a well-controlled manner, and how bacteria build their flagellar motors  to well-defined specifications.     All of these projects employ nonlinear partial differential equations and/or stochastic differential equations while the tools of mathematical modeling, dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, asymptotic analysis, stochastic processes, and numerical simulation are all used in  this work. \r\n\r\nWhile the biological problems to be studied are quite diverse, they are unified by their many common mathematical features.  Thus, this work has the two-fold goal of using mathematical modeling approaches to understand specific complex cellular processes, and to discover common principles and transferable concepts that are in operation in many different areas of biology.  In this way, this work contributes to the development of a fundamental and unified theory of how biological processes work, and in doing so, will contribute to our understanding of many issues relating to human health and medicine.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCells, whether they live as a single unit in a larger community of similar objects, or as part of a multicellular organism, must carry out a wide array of  tasks in order to maintain themselves and/or the organism of which they are a part.  The primary research outcome of this project was to provide an improved understanding of how some of these tasks are accomplished by developing quantitative mathematical theories describing these processes.\n\nFor example, many cells go through a regular division cycle during which they duplicate their chromosomes and then separate them into two identical copies.  This research produced a mathematical model showing that the  separation of chromosomes works because polymers (called microtubules) while depolymerizing, and thereby getting shorter, are nonetheless able to pull apart the chromosomes.  This new theory also produced several predictions about the details of how this works that are suggestive of new experiments.\n\nCells must also regulate the proteins on their surfaces, by removing unnecessary or damaged proteins, while replenishing dysfunctional proteins with newly synthesized ones.  To accomplish this there is an elaborate mechanism to  transport and sort proteins for destruction or recycling.  This research produced a new mathematical model of the sorting and sequestration capabilities of the ESCRT protein machinery.  Several features of this model are currently being explored by experimental techniques. \n\nCells must also communicate with each other, and how that communication takes place is a topic of great importance.  For example, bacterial cells often make decisions about their individual behavior based on the size of their colony or the makeup of their environment.  One tactic that cells use to assess the size of their colony is called quorum sensing.  This research produced a new investigation of the details of the quorum sensing biochemical network in two different species of bacteria, and showed that even though the ``wiring diagram\" of their networks were the same, their response to mutational challenges was quite different.  This work provided a quantitative  explanation for the differences between these networks.\n\nCardiac cells must also communicate with each other in order that the heartbeat be properly synchronized among all cells.  For many years it has been believed that this communication between cells is accomplished by electrical conduction through specialized protein structures called gap junctions.  However, recent experimental evidence has brought this highly accepted view into question.  The result of this research has been to produce a new mathematical model of cardiac cell coupling that incorporates another mechanism, called ephaptic coupling.  The intriguing outcome of this endeavor is that the new model is able to reproduce all of the experimental observations made by our experimental collaborators, especially those that are not captured by a model that includes only gap junctional coupling.  While this work is still in relatively early stages, it is setting the stage for a major shift in the way cardiac cell coupling is viewed.\n\nMany cells are also capable of swimming in an aqueous environment, and to do so must build and operate propulsion motors, called rotary flagellar motors.  This research produced two different mathematical models describing features of these motors.  With the first, we were able to provide a theory for how the length of a flexible universal joint-like protein structure (called the hook) is determined.  Our theory has been nicely confirmed experimentally and has supplanted several previous theories.\nThese rotary motors are capable of spinning at thousands of rpm and switch their direction of rotation in milliseconds.  A mathematical theory for how this directional switching  is accomplished and how it is regulated was one of the topics in the PhD thesis of  Parker Childs.\n\nUnderlying all of this research are questions of how chemicals, especially macromolecules, interact.  This research  resulted in several advances in our understanding of the complicated dynamics of macromolecular reactions.  These included a theory to explain the dynamics of the swelling of polyelectrolyte gels, such as mucin, and to explain the important difference between calcium ions and hydrogen or sodium ions in determining these dynamics; This research also produced advances in our understanding of the dynamics of polymer gel formation, and  led to a new theory of blood clot formation via the polymerizatioon of fibrin molecules.  Especially significant is our new understanding of how the final structure of a fibrin clot is determined by external conditions, such as blood flow and other chemical concentrations. \n\nFinally, during the course of this research project, 5 PhD students completed their PhD theses under the supervision of the PI, and 5 postdoctoral fellows were mentored by the PI.  All of these mentees/advisees are currently employed in academic or industrial positions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James P Keener"
