 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides three-year continued support for the experimental particle physics and astroparticle physics programs at Michigan State University. The intellectual merit deals with the completion of the final chapter of the 1967 Standard Model and its necessary evolution through physics studies at D0 and CDF at the Tevatron at Fermilab, ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, the NuMI Off-axis neutrino Appearance (NOvA) experiment at Fermilab and Ash River, MN, and the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) experiment at the Gamma Ray Observatory at the Sierra Negra in Mexico. The primary research focus is new experiments: ATLAS, HAWC, and NOvA with a selective physics program at D0 and CDF to the completion of the Tevatron program. The broader impacts of this work include the opportunity to bring these front-line research questions into classrooms and to the public at large through lectures and interactive video presentations. In addition, the group engages more than a dozen graduate students and a number of undergraduates into the labs at MSU, Fermilab, and CERN providing unique experiences for students who are often not physics majors.",
