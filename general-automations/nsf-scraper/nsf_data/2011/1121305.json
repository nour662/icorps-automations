 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alpine tundra is threatened by climate change because the low-temperature climates where it exists may be reduced globally.  This study will provide a context for the response of alpine tundra in western North America to climate change by investigating the community structure of alpine tundra at multiple spatial scales.  The focus is on the spatial extent of processes relevant to alpine tundra diversity. This study examines the conjecture that the mix of plant species growing together (or secondarily species diversity) differs along fine spatial scale gradients in soil characteristics.  Soil gradients are nested within broader geographic-scale gradients determined by topography such as slope shape and position and these environments are further nested within regional gradients in climate variables (radiation, temperature, and precipitation).  For example, the amount of water from precipitation at a site is modified by how the terrain alters the redistribution of snow, and the snowmelt available to plants is affected by soil texture.  New data on the abundance of species on alpine tundra sites will be collected and used to derive biodiversity (dependent) variables.  Site conditions (independent variables) of soil and surficial conditions will be examined at fine scale; topographic measures, which are more general conditions given that they are at larger extents than the plants, will be examined at a middle scale, and climate variables from established weather stations will be examined at coarse scale based on extrapolations developed for mountain topography.  In order to explore possible relationships, three analytical methods will be applied for species composition:  Mantel regression with pairwise dissimilarities of vegetation and environmental difference; multiscale ordination using canonical correspondence analysis; and multilevel regression with community composition dependent variables statistically derived by additional ordinations.  For community diversity, multilevel regression will be used with species richness as the dependent variable. \r\n\r\nThis research will advance our understanding of biodiversity and community biogeography by testing hierarchical relations across spatial scales. Multilevel models will be developed to address the kind of hierarchical controls that affect plant diversity and community structure  across greater range of scales than done in prior ecological research. This research will provide new insight into potential ecological responses to climate change, which is a large-scale phenomenon, because it will take into account the spatial heterogeneity that exists at the finest scale. The results will inform National Park Service resource managers about possible future change in alpine tundra biodiversity, an important visual and aesthetic resource. More broadly, this study will improve interpretation and contribute to the findings of a global alpine monitoring network.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis study analyzed the phytogeography of alpine tundra in the western USA.  A dataset that was already in hand, a record of the presence of alpine tundra species on mountain ranges across the western USA, was complemented by the collection of new field data on 320 sites in four regions along a 1600 km transect of the Rocky Mountains.   The new data contains more detailed abundance measures of the plant species and observations of surficial conditions.  These data form the basis for studies of the diversity of alpine tundra and of the methodologies used to discern the environmental factors that control the diversity and distribution of species.  The primary outcome is that the changes in species composition among the mountain ranges of the West and along the transect are primarily related to the geographic distances between them.  This result holds for comparing the plant community composition to distance and climate variables across the entire West and to distance and local environmental variables on the transect.  However, across the West the differences in geology have an effect on the differences in local composition, and the surficial conditions of the sites on the Rocky Mountain transect have a small but significant effect.  The conclusion is that to some extent the assembly of communities as they moved upslope from refugia at the Last Glacial Maximum is still an ongoing process of sorting in relation to the environment.  The methods examined indicate that for these data, wherein the plant community composition is complicated, the most direct methods of analysis, such as comparisons of diversity and Mantel correlations, may be most useful.  Because different environmental variables may determine community composition at different places, structured multilevel analysis may be less effective than unstructured analyses at multiple scales.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dale L Zimmerman"
