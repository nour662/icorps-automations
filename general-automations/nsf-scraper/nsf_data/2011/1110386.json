 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research demonstrates that in wood ducks (Aix sponsa) less than 1\u00a2\u00aaC variation in average incubation temperatures affects duckling growth, body condition, thermoregulatory ability, immune function, stress endocrinology, and locomotor performance. Many of these effects persist until at least several weeks after hatching.  The proposed research will continue to explore the role incubation temperature plays in defining characteristics of hatchling wood ducks that are important to their development. Specifically, this research will investigate whether incubation temperature drives trade-offs between physiological processes critical to early survival in birds, their thermoregulatory ability and the immune system. The proposed research will also explore a potential underlying mechanism responsible for meditating effects of incubation temperature on avian phenotype. \r\n\r\nThis research will integrate research with education primarily by targeting K-12 teachers and students and undergraduates in wildlife sciences and biology.  The K-12 education approach aims both to raise awareness of waterfowl natural history and conservation as well as the scientific process. In teaming with the Virginia Tech Science and Outreach Program, 12 elementary schools, 4 middle schools, 4 high schools, and 4 special education programs will have access to color-printed cards highlighting the natural history and conservation status of Virginia waterfowl. The schools will also have access to lesson plans pertaining to avian incubation and reproductive ecology that incorporate Virginia standards of learning. Education of undergraduates involves a new program that facilitates reciprocal learning by pairing a graduate student with an undergraduate researcher conducting a senior thesis project. The goal of the program is to prepare undergraduates for their upcoming transition to graduate school by giving them hands-on training with all major aspects of academic research, while simultaneously preparing graduate students for their eventual transition into a faculty position. \r\n\r\n",
