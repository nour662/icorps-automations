 "awd_abstract_narration": "The brain consists of billions of neurons, and it is the connections between neurons that provide most brain-specific functions. To form these connections, a neuron extends an axon along a selected pathway following a series of molecular cues present in the developing embryo. Molecules on the surface of the axon called ?receptors? detect these cues and transfer this environmental information to molecules inside of the cell, which in turn regulate the cytoskeleton used to steer the axon as it navigates to its target cell to make a neuronal connection. This investigator will use the fruit fly (Drosophila) as a model organism to study how one receptor molecular (Frazzled) interacts with the Abelson tyrosine kinase inside of a neuron and steers axons across the midline to make connections on the opposite side of the brain. Biochemical techniques are being used to define exactly how Frazzled and Abelson interact with each other. To understand how Abelson regulates the cytoskeletal machinery, each domain of Abelson will be tested for its ability to change the shape of cells in culture and to help guide axons in a developing embryo. All DNA, cell, and fly reagents generated in the study will be made available to the scientific community. Similarly, a database containing all the binding and functional information generated in this study will be linked to Flybase [http://flybase.org/], a major repository of Drosophila research. This study will impact our understanding of a universal problem in brain biology by establishing how bilateral connections are formed in the developing nervous system. The work will also increase our understanding of how Abelson, and related proteins, regulate the machinery underlying the movement of other cell types, including immune cells fighting an infection and cancer metastasis. Finally, the investigator has a strong record of undergraduate and graduate training at an institute with a high percentage of minority and first generation college students.",
