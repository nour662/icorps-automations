 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project students transferring into Colorado State University from community colleges in a regional alliance are given scholarships for their last two years of study in one of the STEM disciplines.  Alliance institutions are heavily Hispanic in the ethnicity of their students, drawn from the local community.  This project is unusually sensitive to informing the students and their families of the opportunities at CSU.  In each new cohort of eight transfer students, the Rocky Mountain Scholars Program provides not only financial aid but support for the academic and social transition to the university.  An existing Center for Undergraduate Research provides research opportunities and academic support.  Two graduate students are trained to serve as mentors to the students.  The ultimate goal of the project is to identify talented students among a population underrepresented in academic science and provide the support needed to encourage them to persevere in their education. Some of them ultimately will become professors for the next generation; all will enhance their communities with their ability to contribute with the skills of STEM.",
