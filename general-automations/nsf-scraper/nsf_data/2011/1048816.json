The workshop brings together researchers in theory, computation, and applications of models for nonlinear waves.  The conference program, which includes tutorials suitable for students, is designed to be valuable for young researchers. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will enhance communication among junior and senior researchers in nonlinear evolution equations.  Conference proceedings will be published.  The conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students, junior researchers, and members of under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  http://www.cs.uga.edu/~thiab/waves2011.html",
