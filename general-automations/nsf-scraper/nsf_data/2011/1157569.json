 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative research project is to design an effective system for managing smart grids and smart meters for electricity production and consumption, with the eventual goal of helping creating a sustainable energy future.  The scope of this research plan encompasses the robust management of smart grids, adaptive usage controls based on real-time information provided by smart meters, and the development of an effective mechanism for coordinating supply and demands.   Smart grids refer to a new and intelligent network of electricity production facilities, transmission grids, equipped with automation software and control systems for delivering and monitoring electricity to meet the demands.  Smart meters are a vital part of the smart grids technology.   These meters are equipped with intelligent sensors that track the real-time consumption of energy, enabling users to monitor their electrical usage during peak versus off-peak hours. \r\n\r\nAlgorithms and systems for making the smart grids more robust, and are able to withstand shocks within the systems will be developed.  There will also be a focus on developing a policy for controlling energy consumption in real-time based on the information provided by the smart meters. If successful, the project will facilitate the realization of smart grid's potential by developing the necessary optimization methods, control policies, and data analysis techniques for the management of smart grids and smart meters. The results of the research will be included in the curriculum of the Master of Engineering Program in Energy Markets and Risk by the IEOR Department at UC Berkeley.  The research will be translated into teaching modules that can be used for Master's students in this program.  Establishment of close collaborative relationships with companies in the energy industry and DOE national labs are planned.",

The plan encompasses research in high-dimensional complex optimization problems related to different aspects of the energy market, including dynamic resource allocations, energy portfolio assortment optimization, and real-time sourcing decisions.\n\n \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merits:  During the lifetime of the award, we have investigated a number of high-dimensional complex stochastic-optimization problems related to the energy smart grid and smart meters, with a particular focus on dynamic pricing and resource allocations.

In addition, our model can be applied to a retailer who runs promotion on its products by placing a sale sign on the product.  With thousands of potentially substitutable and complementary products, the retailer wants to determine the optimal placement of the sale signs. The cross elasticities among products are unknown, and we can learn their values by performing price experimentations.  We must balance the tradeoff between experimenting with different sale sign placements to uncover the cross elasticity structure, and exploiting the best guess optimal decision to maximize revenue. The key challenge in this problem is the large number of products, which renders exhaustive price experimentations of each product impract..."
