 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program entitled \"Imaging in the Physical Sciences\".    (IPS) is a new program hosted by the Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science (CIS) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), which will support seven undergraduate students per year in summer research projects based on imaging in its various forms.  CIS is a highly interdisciplinary University Research and Education Center, dedicated to pushing the frontiers of imaging in all its forms and uses. The IPS REU program will introduce young scientists to research in a highly interdisciplinary environment, where cross-disciplinary team problem solving is the norm. The IPS REU has the following seven specific goals: (i) Involve undergraduates from a wide range of host institution type, gender, and ethnicities in a coherent research experience; (ii) Involve undergraduates originating from a specific science or engineering major in an interdisciplinary research environment, engaging them to work in teams across traditional disciplinary boundaries in problem-based research; (iii) Expose students to the emerging field of imaging science and its many and varied application areas; (iv) Encourage students to pursue graduate studies in STEM; (v) Assist students in the dissemination of their research; (vi) Create an ongoing research incubator environment for the students, including feedback from scientists external to RIT, mentoring in public speaking, scientific writing, and social engagement; (vii) Assess the implementation and impact of the REU Program. The following application areas of imaging research within CIS create an array of research opportunities for undergraduate REU students: astrophysics, remote sensing, biomedical research, environmental science, vision science, nano-technology, materials science, color science, computer graphics, archaeology, and microelectronic engineering.   This award is co-funded by the Division of Physics and the Directorate for Engineering.",
