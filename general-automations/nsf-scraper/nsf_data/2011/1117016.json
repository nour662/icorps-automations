 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses network virtualization by developing a suite of bandwidth allocation and packet scheduling techniques as an integrated framework for switch virtualization. The goal is to achieve scalable, efficient, and isolated link sharing among virtual networks. \r\n\r\nNetwork virtualization allows for the creation of multiple coexisting logical networks, each customized to a specific purpose, by reorganizing the resources of a common physical infrastructure. Network virtualization has many important applications in delivering reduced hardware cost, improved resource utilization, simplified maintenance, and incremental service deployment. Implementation of network virtualization relies on creating slices for various resources of the underlying physical infrastructure. However, effective solutions are needed to create slices for switches, the important interconnecting components of any network. This project  develops  Scalability and Efficiency Aware Link Sharing (SEALS) framework for switch virtualization. \r\n\r\nThis project  considers two types of switch virtualization: intra-switch virtualization which creates multiple logical switches within a physical one, and inter-switch virtualization which creates a logical switch by combining multiple heterogeneous physical ones. The SEALS framework accurately emulates the ideal Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) model to realize scalable, efficient, and isolated switch virtualization. \r\n\r\nA combination of theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments are used to evaluate the design. The SEALS framework is implemented in OpenFlow switches to obtain experimental data from a realistic environment. The outcome of this project will facilitate the creation of commercial and academic virtual networks to build cost-saving infrastructure or experiment new network prototypes. \r\n\r\nThe educational component of this project offers research opportunities in computing to underrepresented minority groups, through summer workshops, curriculum development, and undergraduate research programs. Florida International University is among the top grantors of computer science and engineering degrees to Hispanic students in the nation. Its history of involving underrepresented groups in research efforts will be leveraged during the course of this project. The project web site will be used for dissemination of all publications, course materials, and source code resulted from the project.",
