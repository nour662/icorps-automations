 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program at the University of South Alabama (USA), entitled \"NUE: An Interdisciplinary Modular Approach To Nanodevices And Nanotechnology Objectives Through Engineering via Cyberlearning (AIM AT NANOTEC)\", under the direction of Dr. Srinivas Palanki, is to develop and implement a set of 12 modules that can be integrated into several sophomore, junior and senior level core and elective courses in three different engineering departments (Chemical and Biomolecular, Mechanical, and Electrical and Computer Engineering). Each module will involve problem solving skills at the levels of knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.     \r\n\r\nThe proposed work will have a significant impact on the education mission of the College of Engineering.  Implementation of the program tasks will result in modernizing the engineering content of the core courses in the three engineering departments.  In addition, the formation of multidisciplinary design teams in the senior year that effectively utilize core concepts from the different departments will result in the training of engineers who are well prepared to tackle difficult engineering challenges in the workplace. Furthermore, dissemination of the material developed in this project to high school students through the university outreach program will positively impact enrollment in engineering.",
