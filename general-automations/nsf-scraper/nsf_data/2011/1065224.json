 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to understand and model integration of intermittent renewables.  The research is aimed at systematically understanding the costs, due to increased Ancillary Services requirements and transmission, and benefits of large-scale integration.  The approach is to consider both short-term operations and long-term capital expansion.   The short-term modeling involves the consideration of the amount of Ancillary Services necessary to satisfy North American Reliability Corporation (NERC) standards for frequency control.  The analysis will be accomplished through modeling wind power production as a stochastic process and using a sensitivity analysis with respect to the level of renewables of the control performance of automatic generation control.  The long-term modeling augments classical screening curve analysis to represent the capital and operating costs implications of the need for large amounts of Ancillary Services and increased transmission.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe intellectual merit of the research is that it will more realistically represent issues than in existing renewable integration studies, and will also seek to avoid data intensive and computationally intensive approaches based on full production cost simulation.  The work will develop screening tools that will be useful to estimate costs and for policy analysis, and provide qualitative insights into important issues.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe work proposed here will have the broader impact of enabling principles-based analysis of the most economic ways to reduce greenhouse emissions, considering the full implications of integration of renewable generation assets.  This understanding will inform cost-effective investment in a portfolio of generation resources to reduce overall greenhouse emissions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere are four related outcomes of this project:\n\nUnderstanding the effect of increasing renewables on frequency control,\nStochastic models of wind power production,\nEnhancing screening curve models in the context of increased renewable production, and\nImproving systematic transmission expansion planning including representation of renewables.\n\n\nRegarding the first issue, frequency control in electric systems becomes more critical and more difficult with high penetration of renewables.  The analysis of frequency regulation requirements in this project has modeled the interacting issues of inertia, procured regulation capacity, and regulation ramping capability, and has proposed concrete specifications to ensure that frequency regulation is within North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) mandated requirements, using the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) system as a case study. The consideration of the effect of renewables on frequency in an electric power interconnection, including modeling of overall frequency effects, has begun to elucidate the likely long-term implications on frequency control of significant renewable penetration.\n\nWhile the consideration of effects on frequency control can utilize fairly simple models of the short-term variability of overall wind production, applications at the generation and transmission capital planning scale necessitate longer-term statistics of wind production, including representation of the correlation structure between wind-farms that can affect, for example the need for transmission.  In ERCOT, for example, there are over 100 wind farms, with correlated productions.  We have utilized recent work in generalized dynamic factor models (GDFM) to parsimoniously represent wind and load variations in terms of a much smaller number of independent stochastic processes. We have also begun to understand how to predict the statistical properties of future high wind penetration scenarios from information about historical wind production. This rich model can be applied in a number of ways.  For example, at one extreme, overall statistics of wind production can be utilized in a thermal generation planning model that ignores transmission issues.  At the other extreme, the individual correlated wind production at wind farms can be used to inform transmission planning that must take account of the spatial distribution of the wind production.  These two threads will be elucidated in the following paragraphs.\n\nIn ERCOT, West Texas wind resources tend to generate off-peak.  At the thermal generation expansion planning time scale of years to decades, the increase in production by wind and other resources that predominantly generate off-peak has implications for the portfolio of generators in the residual thermal system.  To understand the implications for generation expansion, we have adapted and developed a screening curve technique that improves on previous work.  The screening curve approach provides a clear connection between:\n\nthe net load curve resulting from the statistics of increased renewable production and negatively correlated load, and \nthe economically-adapted residual thermal system required to provide for that net load.  \n\n\nThe expansion of screening curve methods to consider existing capacity, retirements, and planned outages represents a very significant improvement to the usefulness of this technology.  We have applied it to an ERCOT 2030 case study.\n\nTurning to transmission planning, the stochastic representation of wind and load in a transmission expansion formulation provides a way to navigate between traditional \"worst case\" transmission expansion planning and the implications of the negative correlation between many renewable resources and peak load conditions. The incorporation of N-1 security, which is required in all North American transmission planning, represents a large leap forward in systematic transmission planning.  While significant work remains, we have greatly increased the ability to represent realistic issues in optimization-based transmission planning, going far beyond previous \"academic\" implementations towards realistically being able to solve ERCOT-scale systems representing N-1 security and multiple wind and load scenarios.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ross Baldick"
