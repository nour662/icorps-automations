 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports Rachel Morrish of the Colorado School of Mines as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.  Dr. Morrish will synthesize and study the behavior of photoanodes made from nanomaterials created from earth-abundant materials (Fe/O/S).  She will collaborate with scientists at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to characterize these materials and incorporate photoanodes into tandem cells.  For her plan for broadening participation, the PI will develop a hands-on solar energy demonstration for use in outreach activities and public school teacher-training.  These activities will reach a large number of underrepresented students in the Colorado area.\r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. Morrish is aimed at developing new kinds of materials for the generation of fuel from solar energy.  These materials may help in developing solutions for sustainable energy production.  The particular materials that Dr. Morrish is developing are \"green\" in that they use earth-abundant elements that have low toxicity.   The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Morrish are aimed at giving underrepresented students in the mountain states hands-on activities in important areas of science related to sustainability.",
