 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to understand how routine measurements of pressure, flow and water quality data could be used to characterize leaks and contaminant intrusion in urban water distribution systems and illustrate how this information could be used to aid in the risk assessment of these systems. Research will be conducted in adaptive simulation methods and optimization algorithms enabled by high performance computing to develop a quantitative framework for leak detection and contaminant intrusion characterization that utilizes real time pressure, flow, and water quality data. In addition, this framework will integrate new methodologies for incorporating spatially varying macro indicators and demand uncertainty. The research will also provide a risk analysis capability for analyzing economic and public health risks associated with gradual leaks and contaminant intrusion during routine operations. This quantitative prototype framework is envisioned for use by decision-makers to generate and identify operational strategies as well as to develop long-term maintenance and expansion plans. In addition, it will enable decision-makers to evaluate the risk reduction potential of different response, retrofit and maintenance actions. In collaboration with a major water utility in North Carolina, this quantitative prototype framework will be applied and validated using data from a mid-sized urban area. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will address one of the nation's critical infrastructure security priorities in a real setting and contribute to the development of adaptive simulation methods and optimization algorithms that are enabled by harnessing the power of high-end computing resources.  The computational framework that is formulated and implemented through this research project will set the stage for using emerging automated data collection systems for real time water distribution infrastructure condition assessment. The research methods and tools will also be made available via web-accessible interfaces for instructional and outreach purposes.",

Leaks constitute more than half of all water losses in distribution systems and US is planning to spend nearly 97B for water loss detection and control over the next 20 years (source: US EPA). Furthermore, leakage locations can serve as contaminant intrusion points into the distribution network under certain conditions posing a public health risk to consumers. Therefore, accurately estimating leak locations and magnitudes will lead to improved water distribution management strategies resulting in tremendous cost savings to urban water consumers in the United States.</p>\n<p>The overall objective of this project was to develop a leak and contaminant intrusion characterization methodology for use in risk assessment of urban water distribution systems. To address this overall objective, the following technical objectives were formulated: (i) Develop a leak detection and contaminant intrusion characterization methodology that uses routinely measured pressure and water quality data, (ii) Develop simulation-based procedures for incorporating uncertainties and estimating probability maps for leaks and contaminant intrusion, (iii) Develop a simulation based risk assessment framework for evaluating economic and public health risks from leaks and contaminant intrusion, (iv) Apply and validate the framework using several test cases including a real water distribution system from a medium sized urban area, and (v) Develop high performance optimization and simulation algorithms for enabling real time characterization of leaks and contamination for day to day WDS operations. Project activities targeted the above objectives during the 5 year duration of the project.</p>\n<p>This project has directly contributed to 6 journal articles, 2 MS theses, 1 PhD dissertation, and 10 conference presentations.

This project fully or partially supported the training of 2 Master&rsquo;s students, 2 PhD students, 1 undergraduate student, and 2 post-doctoral associates.

Our results indicate that the heuristic methods have more flexibility in problem representation and are able to handle different types of measurements and uncertainties. The mathematical programming methods (based on successive linear approximation) are computationally more efficient (over two orders of magnitude faster than other methods) and have excellent performance (twice as more accurate than other methods) if the model is properly calibrated and measurement and model errors are small.</li>\n<li><em>Approaches for incorporating uncertainties:</em>&nbsp;Bayesian procedures were developed to estimate leakage locations and magnitudes under model and measurement uncertainties. First, a customized Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach with a discrete proposal distribution based on shortest paths between nodes was developed to estimate leakage locations and their uncertainties under simple measurement errors in the network. This approach was then extended to account for nonlinear uncertainty propagation by including uncertain demand values into the parameter vector and then incorporating the uncertainties directly into the prior distribution. A new adaptive Bayesian framework based on MCMC was developed to obtain posterior distributions of likely leak locations and magnitudes from pressure sensor measurements with errors. In the adaptive algorithm, proposal distributions as well as likelihood function weights are adaptively adjusted to obtain favorable likelihood ratios during each iteration of the algorithm.</li>\n<li><em>High Performance computing:</em>&nbsp;A high performance computing simulation-optimization framework, Optimus (Optimization Methods for Universal Simulators), was developed for parallel execution of simulation-optimization problems. All of our optimization methods and Bayesian estimation methods we incorporated into the Optimus framework for fast execution of our models on high performance cluster resources.</li>\n<li><em>Realistic networks for validation:</em>&nbsp;We have validated our leak detection approaches for a medium sized utility in North Carolina that consists of nearly 27,000 junction nodes. Validation was performed using a default demand pattern and actual demands obtained from automatic metering infrastructure (AMI) data from Sensus Corporation.
