 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Spatial Intelligence and Learning Center (SILC) was established in the fall of 2006 as one of three second-cohort Science of Learning Centers. SILC's purpose is to develop the new science of spatial learning and to use this knowledge to transform STEM educational practice. Spatial learning is the acquisition of spatial knowledge and skills, and the use of spatial knowledge and skills to facilitate learning in both spatial and non-spatial domains. It provides the foundation for a wide range of reasoning skills in STEM-based activities, from solving mathematical problems to engineering new products to understanding graphical depictions of complex systems. Previous research shows that spatial skills are a strong predictor of entry into STEM disciplines in college and into STEM careers, that substantial improvement of spatial learning is possible, and that this improvement matters to STEM success. SILC has brought together researchers from multiple lines of work on spatial cognition and education and from a variety of traditional disciplines (e. g., cognitive science, psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, education, STEM disciplines), integrating them to achieve new insights. SILC researchers are developing a set of powerful tools for spatial learning, honing them into effective, deployable educational techniques and practices for STEM learning, including advanced technology (e.g., intelligent educational software), effective curriculum units (e.g., in elementary school mathematics), engaging activities (e.g., in children's museums), and spatial assessment instruments (e.g., testing children's spatial skills, testing adults' STEM-relevant spatial skills). Several of the insights, tools and products from SILC's initial funding period already hold transformational potential for spatial learning. Research and translational activities in the second and last funding period, from 2011-2016, will continue the investment in the science of spatial learning, in order to allow the fulfillment of this promise.",
