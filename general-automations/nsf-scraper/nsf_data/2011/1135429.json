Presentations will be on the latest achievements in biofuels in terms of research and and current and future opportunities in advancing biofuels. The first day (Wednesday, October 5th) will focus on the education and training of selected middle school science teachers and students in the generation of biofuels from microbial oils. MSU currently has state of the art fermentation facilities that will be used to teach and illustrate the bioprocessing steps involved in microbial oil generation. Furthermore, MSU will have a 1000 L pilot facility for the production of microbial oils. Middle school teachers\r\nand students will have the opportunity to connect observations at the laboratory scale with the functioning and operation of the pilot scale facility. Experience indicates that many students begin to get attracted to specific careers at the 7th-8th grade levels. It is the intention to contribute to this process by exposiong selected students to the science and engineering of biofuels, and to highlight the importance of this area to their daily lives.  Another major feature will be the connection of several groups of scientists from around the world (Puerto Rico, Germany, and Mexico) via Skype and/or webcast. Their interaction with the audience at MSU will provide useful information on the specific regulatory framework and the science and engineering infrastructure in place in these countries. The conference will provide an excellent environment for students to defend/debate research findings in front of internationally recognized experts in biofuels. A student poster contest will give students the chance, to not only showcase their research projects, but also to network with potential employers for job opportunities in both industry and academia.  The conference will highlight two new biofuel pilot facilities.  One of the pilot facilities is for the generation of microbial oils using municipal and industrial wastewaters as the growth media, and the other is for production pyrolysis oil using biomass. Both of these renewable oils can be used to produce biofuels (renewable diesel, biodiesel, or BioJetFuel). Tours to demonstrate the operation of these facilities will be included as part of the conference.",

Students (7th-8th grades) were provided a seminar on biofuel production processes, and the importance to develop alternative to fossil, non-renewable fuels.  Students were shown the process of microbial oils and biodiesel production.  Our experience as a chemical engineering department during the recruitment of prospective students indicates that many begin to get attracted to specific careers at the 7th-8th grade levels.

They toured the biofuel production and analytical facilities, and were provided with information about engineering careers, and their relation to the biofuels industry.\n\nOn October 6, The Honorable Raymond Mabus, Secretary of the Navy, provided the opening presentation.  He highlighted the importance of domestic sources of fuels to national security and the commitment of the Navy to displace 50% of fuel consumption with biofuels by the year 2020.  His presentation attracted over 225 people and generated several press articles and newsletters:\n\n MSU biofuels research contributes to national security (MSU University Relations)\n\nhttp://www.msstate.edu/web/media/detail.php?id=5373\n\n MSU biofuels conference a success (Energy Institute newsletter)\n\nhttp://www.ei.msstate.edu/newsletter/March2012/story2.html\n\n Mabus speaks at Mississippi State biofuels conference (Biodiesel Magazine)\n\nhttp://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/8100/mabus-speaks-at-mississippi-state-biofuels-conference \n\n Biofuels Conference: Secretary of the Navy says military can lead the way in alternative energy (The Dispatch)\n\nhttp://www.cdispatch.com/news/article.asp?aid=13418 \n\n U.S. secretary of Navy attends biofuels conference (The Reflector)\n\nhttp://www.reflector-online.com/news/u-s-secretary-of-navy-attends-biofuels-conference-1.2650057#.T9X9-dVfGSo \n\n Mabus: Biofuels make Navy 'better war fighters' (Navy Times)\n\nhttp://www.navytimes.com/news/2011/10/ap-mabus-biofuels-make-navy-better-war-fighters-100711/ \n\n Mabus: Biofuel research crucial to U.S. Navy (Mississippi Business Journal)\n\nhttp://msbusiness.com/2011/10/mabus-biofuel-research-crucial-to-u-s-navy/ \n\n Navy secretary speaks at biofuels conference (Ventura Country Star, The Associated Press)\n\nhttp://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/oct/07/navy-secretary-speaks-at-biofuels-conference/?print=1  \n\nThe conference integrated most of the key components of biofuel production.  In addition to a link between fundamental research and commercial applications, the agenda included presentations on biomass feedstocks (Phillip Jennings, REPREVE Renewables), chain supply economics (Dr. Sandra Eksioglu, MSU), and environmental and energy sustainability (Dr. Joseph Fiksel, The Ohio State University).  It is important to highlight the fact that chemical and/or biochemical conversion processes can successfully transform biomass into fuels and chemicals.  However, in many cases, the logist..."
