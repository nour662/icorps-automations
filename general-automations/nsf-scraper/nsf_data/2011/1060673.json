 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Boscovich Physics Scholars Program at Seattle University provides scholarships to students working towards a B.S. or B.A. degree with a major in physics.  The scholarships are based on both academic merit and financial need and are giving talented but economically disadvantaged students access to careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields.  They cover a student's unmet financial need up to $10,000 per year, renewable for four years for incoming freshmen, three years for sophomores and transfer students, and an additional year for students pursuing simultaneous bachelor's degrees in both physics and engineering.  \r\n\r\nThe program is housed in a vibrant physics department that combines a rigorous program with a supportive and collegial environment.  Boscovich Scholars enjoy close interaction with faculty, opportunities to participate in research of discovery, career mentoring for graduate school and job applications, and the Physics Opportunities Colloquium series, featuring physicists in diverse STEM careers.  Students, staff, and faculty in the department form a tightly-knit intellectual community, engaging together in academic, social, and service activities.  The supportive environment enhances retention, increases academic performance, and encourages scholars to pursue STEM careers.  Graduates routinely go on to  excellent graduate programs in physics, engineering, or mathematics or to STEM jobs in industry.  \r\n\r\nThe program supports the national priority of increasing the number of talented people in STEM fields.  It particularly promotes participation by women and underrepresented minorities, and graduation rates in both of these groups are above the national average for physics degree programs.  In addition to their excellent technical training, participants also benefit from a broad liberal arts education that emphasizes critical thinking, global awareness, and personal and social responsibility.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Physics Department at Seattle University has been engaged in an effort to increase its enrollment of physics majors and of those who graduate from the university?s College of Science and Engineering with STEM degrees and go on to pursue STEM careers.  With the S-STEM grant, the department was able to fund its annual recruitment workshop, SU PhysFest, and created the Seattle University Boscovich Physics Scholars Program.  The program augmented the recruitment and retention power of the department through talent and need based scholarships of up to $10,000 per year to help students with the high cost barrier of this private university.  Career guidance was also enhanced by creating the Physics Opportunities Colloquium, a speaker series designed to present students with a range of STEM career options for physics majors including nonacademic careers and alternative graduate programs.\n\nThe Boscovich Physics Scholars Program supported 25 students over seven years, for a total disbursement of over $516,000 in scholarships.  Of those 25 program participants, 12 completed physics degrees and continued their careers in STEM-related fields, seven are still enrolled and plan to graduate a physics major within the next three years, two have left physics and lost eligibility for the Boscovich program but nonetheless continued their education in STEM fields, and four lost eligibility for the Boscovich program and consequently left school or changed to non-STEM majors. In all, 21 of the 25 have continued or are continuing on a STEM career path. Many of the scholars have had other STEM majors in addition to physics, including mathematics, electrical and computer engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, and chemistry, and many have gone on in STEM career paths that do not include physics Ph.D. programs.\n\nMeanwhile, since the start of the department?s recruitment effort, enhanced by the Boscovich Physics Scholars Program?s S-STEM scholarships, the Physics Department has seen a near-doubling of its enrollment.  The number of physics majors has increased from 17 at the start of the recruitment program to a sustained level of 32, achieving a peak of 42 students.  The increased enrollment has enabled the department to stabilize its major curriculum by offering required major courses every year.  The creation of the Boscovich Physics Scholars Program at Seattle University through the NSF S-STEM program has strengthened the Physics Department considerably and provided many talented students with entry into the careers in STEM.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul W Fontana"
