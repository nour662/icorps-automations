 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program of the Chemistry Division and co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering, Professor David Jonas of the University of Colorado at Boulder will develop approaches to two-dimensional Fourier transform femtosecond spectroscopy with pulses approaching octave (factor of 2) frequency spans in the optical and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The project includes an international collaboration to use pulsed laser sources developed in the laboratory of Jens Biegert at ICFO (Spain).  Femtosecond spectroscopy will be used to study the electronic and vibrational dynamics at conical intersections in two classes of molecules: phthalocyanines, where the temperature dependence of dynamics at conical intersections can test theoretical predictions about the role of vibrational wavepacket width; and carotenoids, which play diverse and not yet mechanistically understood roles in protecting many biological systems from excess sunlight. \r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the approaches to two-dimensional spectroscopy developed in this project will become useful for determining how electronic motions both drive and are driven by atomic rearrangements in chemical reactions. Graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher participating in the project will be trained in scientific research, gain valuable experience in international collaboration, and present project results at national meetings of scientific professional societies and international interdisciplinary conferences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nVirtually all our energy supply ultimately arises from photosynthesis, the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy by plants, algae, and some bacteria (for example, the energy content of petroleum is stored from photosynthesis long ago).  We began this NSF supported project with experimental and theoretical work aimed at understanding the coupled motions of nuclei and electrons in molecules that were electronically excited near conical intersections and funnels.  Conical intersections and funnels are features of molecular potential energy surfaces where electronic energy can be converted into vibrational energy (energy of relative motion of the nuclei in a molecule), and we studied them with two-dimensional femtosecond spectroscopy, a kind of two-dimensional spectroscopy similar to that used in magnetic resonance imaging, but capable of following electronic and vibrational motion with femtosecond (1 femtosecond = 1 millionth of a billionth of a second) time-resolution using pulses of light. This work led us to recognize similar vibrational signatures in published two-dimensional femtosecond spectra of photosynthetic antennas, which harvest sunlight in photosynthesis and transfer the energy from the molecules that absorb sunlight to other molecules that store energy through chemical reactions.  The efficiency of natural photosynthetic energy transfer had not been understood, but is higher than the efficiency of any man-made system.  Our calculations for these antenna systems led us to discover a new kind of nested, unavoidable, funnel in photosynthetic antennas.  The calculations show that photosynthetic energy transfer can proceed via pathways in which the electronic energy transferred to the acceptor molecule is separated from excess vibrational energy, which is left behind on the donor molecule - such pathways are neglected in the vibronic exciton model (widely used for molecular aggregates, such as those used in photographic film) and the coherent exciton scattering approximation (widely used for polymers, which are used in some light emitting diodes and photovoltaics).  Furthermore, the unavoidable nature of these new funnels means that the faster electrons do not have to wait for the nuclei to vibrate toward any special molecular shape before energy transfer can take place - the electrons can transfer energy from one pigment to another at any energetically accessible pigment shape.  Signatures of this new mechanism are found in photosynthetic antennas that contain 5 different pigments and are responsible for over half of the world's solar light harvesting.  Signatures are also found in published two-dimensional spectra of an efficient light harvesting polymer, suggesting that this new mechanism may be useful for light harvesting in organic photovoltaics and artificial photosynthesis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Jonas"
