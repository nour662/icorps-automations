This SREE meeting has mathematics and science education research and evaluation as its focus.  The first workshop will examine research design, and will specifically focus on the design of experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation studies. The second will examine ideas of multilevel populations and samples, and their implications for multilevel theories in evaluation research and for the analysis of experiments and quasi-experiments. SREE is funded by the U.S. Department of Education and having NSF support a pre-session workshop on quantitative research design is a nice connection with the U.S. Department of Education.  NSF PIs and contractors will be targeted to participate and the workshops should increase the number of quantitative research designs submitted by proposers to NSF programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this project was to increasing the capacity to carry out sophisticated evaluation research in mathematics and science education.  It did so by providing professional development opportunities in advanced methods of evaluation research through programs to practicing researchers. \n\nIntellectual Merit: The Importance of Professional Training in Evaluation Research\n\n            Professional development opportunities are particularly important in mathematics and science education research for several reasons. Most mathematics and science education researchers were not trained as evaluation researchers. The field of evaluation research has advanced substantially in the last few decades, so even those who had evaluation researcher training in graduate school may not have had access to training in methods that are the current state of the art, because they were developed after their graduate training. Evaluation research is increasingly interdisciplinary, therefore no single department (indeed, few single universities) can provide training in all of them.\n\nProposal\n\n            We offered two, two-day research training workshops for mathematics and science education researchers in Washington, DC as adjuncts to the Society for Research on Educational Effectiveness (SREE) topical meeting on math and science education in Fall 2011.  These training workshops were taught by leaders in the field with substantial experience in these methods.  Both workshops involved both theory and active problem solving by participants.  Because a key component of professional training is the informal interaction of participants with instructors and one another, the workshops were small by design (approximately 25 participants each).  In addition we supplied refreshments at breaks and meals to facilitate that interaction (which were included among the costs of the conference).\n\n            Two topics were offered that were of specific interest to NSF researchers: Research design and the theory and application of hierarchical linear models in evaluation research.\n\n            Research Design. This workshop focused on the design of experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation studies, with an emphasis will be on the Campbell-Stanley-Cook-Shadish validity framework to evaluate potential research designs.  The emphasis was on the most widely used experimental and quasi-experimental designs, including nonequivalent control group designs, regression discontinuity designs, and the use of modern methods of multivariate matching such as propensity score methods. \n\n          Hierarchical Linear Models. This course started with ideas of multilevel populations and samples, and their implications for multilevel theories in evaluation research and for the analysis of experiments and quasi-experiments. Participants were introduced to the use of HLM software and will use this software to carry out analyses during the course.\n\nBroader Impacts: How the Workshop will Contribute to STEM Education Research\n\n            This set of training workshops will improve the capacity of the STEM education research community to carry out evaluation research.  It will produce a group of 50 researchers who have an introduction to state of the art methods in the design and analysis of evaluation research.  We also videotaped portions of these workshops and the SREE intends to make the videotapes available on the SREE website as part of its ongoing effort to build capacity in the broader field of education sciences.          \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/10/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Larry V Hedges"
