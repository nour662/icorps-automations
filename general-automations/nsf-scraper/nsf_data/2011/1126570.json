Distinct from previous approaches, the proposed approach quantifies the usability of each modality and then formalizes the adaptation issue as searching for a set of input/output modalities that produce the highest usability, i.e., an optimization issue. In addition to the interaction context, our approach also considers the effects of computing infrastructures (e.g., system resources and networking) on the modality adaptation. The proposed work establishes the first Natural Interaction Laboratory in North Dakota, enabling the following research projects in Adaptive Natural Interaction:\r\n-\tEstablishing common interaction context across multiple scenarios,\r\n-\tDevice-aware establishment of modality space,\r\n-\tDevice-aware establishment of usability space, and\r\n-\tQuality of service in the human/computer interaction context.\r\nThe work aims to develop a unifying infrastructure for research by providing a common programming interface across multiple devices. \r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis instrumentation should provide a unique research facility for faculty and graduate students to conduct research on user interaction-enhancing technology and education. The proposal enhances PhD production in an EPSCoR state, encourages underrepresented students into research via the NATURE (Nurturing American Tribal Undergraduate Research and Educations) and WISMET (Women in Science, Math, Engineering, and Technology) programs, provides research opportunities to undergraduate students, and impacts industry and economic development in North Dakota.",

This infrastructure provided a novel interaction style that seamlessly integrated a Microsoft PixelSense tabletop and Android devices together. Specifically speaking, an infrared camera, which is embedded on a Microsoft PixelSense tabletop, was used to recognize each user and to track his/her action on the surface of the tabletop. Based on the user's action, a personal mobile interface was generated on a smartphone that belonged to the user. Such a multi-device interaction style supplements a public space (i.e., a tabletop) with a private space (i.e., a mobile device), and facilitates information sharing without compromising privacy. In addition to the interaction between large and small display devices, we also investigated the interaction between a mobile device and a piece of traditional paper, called PhoneLens. A user worked on a large piece of paper by moving his/her smartphone on top of the paper. Then, corresponding digital information is displayed on the smartphone based on the user&rsquo;s movement. This work integrated the benefits of paper and mobile device.

The zigzag paradigm shifted the even rows to the right by d/2 cm where d is the distance between two adjacent characters.
