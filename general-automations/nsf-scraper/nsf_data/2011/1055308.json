 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER proposal aims at the development of a single-chip reconfigurable MEMS filter platform\r\nfor multi-band, multi-standard radios through fusion of acoustoelectrically amplified nano-mechanical\r\nfilters and 3D tunable components. Reconfigurable filters can greatly enhance the performance and\r\nreduce the size of RF front-ends, and as such have received great attention for effective and low-power\r\nprocessing of the frequency spectrum. Despite their great promise, lack of integration and narrow\r\nfrequency coverage of current reconfigurable filters continue to hinder their use in practical applications.\r\nIn addition, current technologies have failed to reduce the size of filters without deteriorating critical\r\nperformance metrics such as loss, power handling and termination impedance. To-date, a versatile and\r\nreconfigurable filter array platform does not exist in monolithic form, an important problem that has\r\nremained unsolved despite major advancement in MEMS. This proposal tackles the fundamental issues\r\nrelated to reconfigurable filter arrays and proposes a novel technique that offers frequency, bandwidth and\r\namplitude tunability through integration of narrow-band acoustic filters with tunable lumped filters.\r\nThese are believed to be the most prominent steps toward the realization of a single-chip multi-band lowpower\r\nradio.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merits: The proposed work explores a new approach to developing integrated reconfigurable\r\nfilters with wide tuning range and reduced loss. This new approach relies on the acoustoelectric effect, a\r\nphenomenon caused by interactions between electrons and phonons. Using this effect, which is most\r\neffective in nano-scale, a new class of nano-mechanical acoustic filters with potentially negative loss (i.e.\r\npositive gain) will be developed. This will yield new opportunities for acoustic devices and\r\ninstrumentation. In addition, using advanced 3D micromachining techniques microscale tunable lumped\r\ncomponents with unparalleled Qs exceeding 150 and wide tuning range will be developed. The high-Q\r\ntunable passives will be utilized to reduce parasitics of acoustic filters and assist in tuning their frequency\r\nresponse. The PI will leverage her prior work on high-Q passives and micro-fabrication techniques\r\ntowards this proposed research. Along with the experimental work, the proposed research aims to\r\nadvance the scientific community?s understanding of the physical phenomena that govern the\r\nperformance of the proposed MEMS arrays and new technologies that overcome these physical limits.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed research enables on-chip reconfigurable high-Q filtering, eliminating\r\nmany of the redundant components in RF transceivers, which results in drastically smaller form factor and\r\nreduced power consumption. In a cellular phone, elimination of only one off-chip fixed-frequency filter\r\nas well as the associated matching network using the proposed technique reduces the transmit printed\r\ncircuit board area by more than 75%, while lowering the bill-of-materials. As such, the proposed research\r\nwill have transformative impact on telecommunication. The reconfigurable MEMS filters developed in\r\nthis CAREER program could have far-reaching applications beyond wireless communication ranging\r\nfrom medical ultrasonic imaging to non-contact sensing. In addition to the outlined research effort, an\r\nintegrated educational program will be established which aims to educate students through direct\r\nparticipation in the research activities. The outreach efforts of this project are aimed at promoting\r\ndiversity among engineers and scientists and specifically increasing the proportion of women in\r\nengineering to a healthy level (>30%). To reach this goal and to motivate and educate students, the PI\r\nwill pursue the following avenues: (1) Educational outreach through School of Education to high school\r\nteachers to observe the classroom dynamics in the 6th and 7th grades where female students start to lose\r\ninterest in engineering as well as summer outreach programs to expose high school students to the field of\r\nMEMS by involving them in the proposed research activities; (2) Involvement of undergraduate students\r\nfrom underrepresented groups in PI?s research and educational activities; (3) Creating a multi-disciplinary\r\nscientific learning environment for students and training several doctoral students; (4) Introduction of a\r\nnew graduate course on RF MEMS. Students will gain research experience and discover real world\r\napplications of RF MEMS through team projects in a laboratory setting; (5) Dissemination of the\r\nscientific results of this research.",
