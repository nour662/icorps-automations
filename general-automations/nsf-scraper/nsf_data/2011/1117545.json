 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most natural signals are inherently sparse in certain bases or dictionaries where they can be \r\napproximately represented by only a few significant components carrying the most relevant \r\ninformation. In other words, the intrinsic signal information usually lies in a low-dimensional \r\nsubspace and the semantic information is often encoded in the sparse representation. \r\nProcessing of such signals in the sparsified domain is much faster, simpler, and more robust \r\nthan doing so in the original domain, making sparsity an extremely powerful tool in many \r\nclassical signal processing applications. Recently, with the emergence of the Compressed \r\nSensing (CS) framework, sparse representation and related optimization problems involving \r\nsparsity as a prior called sparse recovery have increasingly attracted the interest of researchers \r\nin various diverse disciplines, from statistics, to information theory, applied mathematics, \r\nsignal processing, coding theory and theoretical computer science.\r\n\r\nThis research involves the analysis, development, and application of robust sparsity-driven \r\nalgorithms for already-collected highly-correlated data sets where signals often exhibit a high \r\nlevel of joint-sparsity and rich correlation structure. Examples of such data include natural video \r\nsequences, volumetric medical images, huge image database, hyperspectral imagery (HSI), \r\nand raw synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals. The research develops a novel unifying robust \r\nsparse-recovery framework based on context-aware and observable data-adaptive dictionaries,\r\nfocusing on two classes of practical applications of sparse recovery: (i) Representative -- \r\ndenoising, concealment, inpainting, enhancement; and (ii) Discriminative -- clustering, detection, \r\nclassification, and recognition. Recovery/Discrimination accuracy is greatly improved by taking \r\ninto account inter-patch spatial correlation,  inter-frame temporal correlation, and by adapting \r\nalgorithms dynamically based on local signal contents as well as by maximizing the level of \r\ndiscrimination within the sparse recovery process.",
