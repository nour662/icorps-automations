The funds are to be used entirely to support graduate students and postdoctoral research associates who otherwise could not afford to attend the conference. Special consideration will be given to enhancing the attendance by women and underrepresented minorities. The latest results in experimental and theoretical particle physics, particle astrophysics, cosmology, and heavy ion physics will be presented in plenary and parallel sessions. Many of the talks at this meeting will be presented by junior physicists, including the graduate students and postdoctoral research associates who will be supported by this grant. Broader impacts include the promotion of a general interest in science while advancing discovery. It will include a special lecture given to the public where the forefront results in high energy physics will be presented in a popular manner.",
