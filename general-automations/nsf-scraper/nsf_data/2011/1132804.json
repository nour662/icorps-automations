Susan Coppersmith and Mark Friesen from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in conjunction with Dr. Xuedong Hu from the University of Buffalo propose to establish a collaborative international network with Prof. Belita Koiller from the University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to perform investigations of materials suitable for qubits and related applications. A key focus of the proposed work is the research on the effects of silicon's conduction band valleys on spintronic and quantum devices. Recent experiments have shown a greatly enhanced valley splitting at a silicon/silicon-dioxide interface. Several of the investigators in this proposal have shown that surface states can lead to such an enhancement. Thus one goal of the proposed collaborative network is to see if such a mechanism applies more generally which will enable enhanced control of the valley splitting, and in turn could enable quantum devices that can operate at higher temperatures. The experimental effort at Wisconsin will be enhanced by the theoretical work being advanced at Buffalo. The US team will also greatly benefit from the theoretical accomplishments of the Brazilian researchers who under Dr. Koiller have significant expertise in studying quantum physics in solid state materials.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit from the proposed the international network of investigators is the involvement of US students and post-docs to collaborate and be mentored by Brazilian colleagues with related but distinct expertise on the science of solid-state spintronics and quantum information processing.",

The support enabled substantial research progress on multiple projects involving the use of spins in semiconductors for quantum computing.  This report summarizes two of the major research advances resulting from the award.\n\n1) The first major project investigated the possible use of holes in germanium heterostructures for quantum computing applications.  This materials system has the advantage that the mobility of the carriers tends to be very high, which is desirable, but it has the additional complexity of having heavy and light hole bands, which could make the use of these carriers as qubits more complex.  In this project, we showed that strain in the heterostructure leads to a large intrinsic splitting between the heavy and light hole bands that is robust against interfacial disorder, which is very favorable for making qubits.  We also found that the effective masses of the hybridized hole bands are both much smaller than in Si, making it possible to form larger dots, with fewer fabrication challenges, and lower susceptibility to localization caused by disorder.  These results are very promising for the use of these heterostructures for making qubits.\n\n2)  The second major project investigated the effects of impurities in silicon nanodevices used to make quantum dot qubits. Fabricating qubits in silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) quantum dot devices for quantum information processing applications is attractive due to the long spin coherence times in silicon and because of the similarity of this technology with that used for the manufacture of current, classical, electronics.
