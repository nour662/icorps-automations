 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observation of the tight correlation between greenhouse gas concentrations and indicators of temperature from the ice core record has had a profound impact on our understanding of the relationship between greenhouse gases and climate. However, despite many decades of research, we still do not have a firm understanding of the causes of the variability in greenhouse gas concentrations. The hydroxyl radical (OH) plays a major role in determining the lifetimes of atmospheric trace gases important to both climate change (e.g. CH4) and human health (e.g. CO), and largely determines the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. The oxygen isotopic composition (&#8710;17O) of nitrate and sulfate aerosols extracted from ice cores provides information about the chemistry of past atmospheres, and can serve as a tool for evaluating model simulations of paleo atmospheric chemistry. Initial measurements of sulfate and nitrate &#8710;17O from the Vostok, Antarctica ice core suggest higher tropospheric O3 concentrations in polar-regions and higher OH concentrations in the mid- to high-latitudes during the last glacial period relative to the preindustrial Holocene. Quantitative interpretation of these data sets is ongoing using a global chemistry-climate model containing the isotopic tracers, and demonstrates the sensitivity of nitrate and sulfate &#8710;17O to oxidant concentrations. Currently, no measurements of sulfate and nitrate &#8710;17O exist on the glacial-interglacial timescale in the Northern Hemisphere. Our goal here is to expand the existing observational data set on the glacial-interglacial timescale to the Northern Hemisphere in order to test the hypothesis that variability in methane concentrations on the on this timescale is largely (50%) due to changes in tropospheric OH concentrations, as has been suggested by terrestrial vegetation modeling. We also will provide a first look into whether changes in OH may partially explain variability of methane during two abrupt climate events. Quantitative information about the sink strength of methane will transform our ability to quantitatively interpret the methane record as a proxy for terrestrial climate conditions, and as such improve our understanding of the mechanistic feedbacks between climate change and the sources and sinks of methane. Understanding the affects of a changing climate on atmospheric chemistry and the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere is crucial for predicting the impacts of future climate change on local and regional air pollution and human health. The project will involve training two graduate students (one US and one French) in the tools of geochemical analysis in an interdisciplinary and international context.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\n\nThe oxidation capacity of the atmosphere determines the atmospheric lifetime of most reduced trace gases in the atmosphere that serve as pollutants and greenhouse gases.  The oxidation capacity is defined by the global abundance of oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical (OH) and tropospheric ozone.  Although much as been learned about past variability in the atmospheric abundance of greenhouse gases such as methane, the cause of the observed variability is still unknown, compromising our ability to predict future abundances. \n\n \n\nThis research project measured an ice-core proxy for the abundance of oxidants from a Greenland ice core.  The time periods of focus were major climate transitions such as glacial-interglacial transitions and rapid climate change events during the last glacial period.  We found large and abrupt changes in oxidants on both of these time scales, suggesting potentially significant changes in the methane lifetime with climate.  The direction of change of these oxidant abundances suggests an important role for the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere in driving atmospheric chemistry on these timescales, something that is typically ignored or assumed to be constant in models when evaluating potential climate-driven changes in the lifetime of reduced trace gases such as methane in the atmosphere.  Our results suggest that the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere and its impacts on stratospheric ozone abundances must be included in models estimating climate-driven changes in the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, and interpreting the cause of the observed variability in atmospheric trace gases and aerosols preserved in ice cores.\n\n \n\nBROADER IMPACTS\n\nThis research has transformed our understanding of the drivers for potential changes in the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere over major climate change and provides an observation-based constraint for chemistry-climate models.  This will ultimately improve our ability to predict the future atmospheric abundance of pollutants and greenhouse gases.  This project provided training for one postdoctoral researcher and one undergraduate student.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Becky Alexander"
