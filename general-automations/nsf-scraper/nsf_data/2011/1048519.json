This project will increase the knowledge and understanding of\r\nSTEM faculty and their mentees in regards to developing, implementing, and planning\r\ninternational research and education collaborations. In particular, this project will help STEM\r\nfaculty better understand international research priorities, resources for planning and\r\ndeveloping international research collaborations, and guidelines for U.S. STEM researchers\r\ntraveling and conducting research abroad.",
