It also allows these students to partially offset registration costs. The CAV Travel Awards committee emphasizes funding minorities and underrepresented groups. This CAV is 23rd in its series and continues to be pivotal in developing new methods for software and hardware correctness.\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT: CAV is the premier conference on software and hardware correctness based on model checking and allied technologies. These methods are fundamental to the production of correct hardware and software. This funding allows the advancement of science by increasing attendance and participation by students, especially underrepresented groups. Such participation is vital for sustaining the intellectual aspects of a flagship conference.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT: This award ensures the participation of students, especially underrepresented groups and minorities, in the software and hardware revolution.  It ensures the development of vital technologies for correct operation of computing systems used for critical applications ranging from medical to aerospace.  It ensures adequate and broad-based supply of trained manpower for hardware/software industries and academia.",
