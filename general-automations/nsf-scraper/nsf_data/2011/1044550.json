 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a collaborative effort involving Texas Tech University, Missouri University of Science and Technology, and University of Texas - Pan American.  It is developing a suite of multimedia educational materials and supporting mechanisms to create a knowledge-centered learning environment for the undergraduate instruction of stochastic processes and applied probability that seamlessly integrates into the curriculum.  This project is creating high-quality video clips that challenge students to solve real problems from industry in collaborative settings.  These videos are being posted on a project website along with other supporting material consisting of wiki-style tutorials and problem-solving software. A Facebook page for the project is being created to support a \"wall\" where students may collaboratively work on active problems and tangentially develop professional skills, such as teaming and communication. The investigators are anticipating that students at other location, even without their instructors directing them, will visit the site and will learn through the knowledge-centered aspects of the wiki-style resources, \"wall\" discussions, and review of active and archived problems.  The team is making sure that students from underrepresented groups are featured in the videos in an effort to increase the interest among these groups of students.  The project is using a few external faculty members as a design review team to provide guidance, and an experienced outside evaluator is using surveys and tests to monitor progress toward the learning outcomes and data on website and Facebook visits to monitor participation.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of the project's products through the website postings and the use of social networking and the focus on broadening the participation of underrepresented groups.",
