 "awd_abstract_narration": "This full research and development project is to design, develop, and test a cutting-edge learning environment where students and teachers solve mathematical problems and communicate their thinking with others through the virtual environment.  The major focus is to increase the quality and quantity of significant math discourse among mathematics teachers and their students by using the virtual learning environment.  The researchers will test the usability of the learning environment for engaging students in high quality discourse.  The researchers will also examine the impact of the virtual learning environment on student significant mathematical discourse and achievement.\r\n\r\nThe project uses a design research method as well as summative evaluations to achieve research and development goals.  Mixed methods will be used to examine the impact of the virtual learning environment on student significant mathematical discourse and achievement.\r\n\r\nThe findings of the project contribute to the field in three ways: (1) The virtual learning environment can be both an effective pedagogical tool and a research tool in mathematics education; (2) It will contribute to our understanding about the nature of mathematical discourse online as well as about ways to foster the quality and quantity of significant math discourse among teachers and their students; and (3) This project can provide insights into effective online deliveries of courses.",
