 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information theory, communication theory, and statistical signal \r\nprocessing have proven spectacularly successful as innovation engines \r\nfor communication, data compression, and information processing \r\ntechnologies. Although in principle these theories are quite general, \r\nin practice they are most useful for a particular family of models, \r\nsuch as discrete Markov sources and channels with additive \r\nGaussian noise. Although this family is quite rich and encompasses \r\nmany practical technologies, there are several important scenarios that\r\nfall outside of these models. In particular, the timing of discrete events is \r\nthe modality of interest in many applications, such as neuroscience\r\nand certain problems in network security, and this modality does \r\nnot fit neatly into the standard classes. This research involves\r\nextending information theory, communication theory, and statistical signal\r\nprocessing to develop a general theory of information transfer via timing. \r\n\r\nThe first phase of this research involves solving several concrete\r\nproblems involving information transfer via timing, such as the\r\nsecrecy capacity of timing channels and how to minimize information\r\ntransfer via timing side channels in both wireless and wireline\r\nnetworks. The second phase involves interconnecting these disparate\r\nproblems to form a general theory of information transfer via timing.\r\nBy elevating the role of timing in information transfer,\r\nthis research better positions the fields of information theory,\r\ncommunication theory, and statistical signal processing to\r\nimpact allied fields such as networking, neuroscience, and \r\noperations research, where timing and delay are of fundamental\r\nimportance. This impact is facilitated through special topics \r\ncourses and invited sessions at conferences, both of which are \r\ndesigned to attract participants from a range of areas.",
