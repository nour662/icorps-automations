 "awd_abstract_narration": "Type 1 - LOIL02170097: Decadal predictability of extreme events:\r\nImpact of a model error representation and numerical resolution\r\n(collaborative research)\r\nThe investigators will implement a stochastic backscatter scheme into the Community\r\nAtmosphere Model and explore how to improve the internal variability and, in particular,\r\nthe prediction of extreme events on decadal and regional scales. Only a small number of\r\npublications apply Extreme Value Theory to climate models and many questions remain\r\nopen. While some work has been conducted comparing model and reanalysis with constant\r\ngreenhouse forcing, the major body of published work in this area focuses on the occurrence\r\nof extreme events in a changing climate and on the robustness of climate trends of extreme\r\nevents across di\u000berent low-resolution models.\r\nThe emphasis of the investigators is very di\u000berent: they will look at the internal variability\r\nof models under a constant greenhouse forcing. The investigators focus both on the ability of\r\nlow-resolution climate models to realistically predict extreme events on decadal time-scales\r\nand global spatial scales, and on the feasibility of replacing the missing variability due to\r\nlow-resolution with a stochastic model error scheme and if such a scheme can improve the\r\ndecadal prediction of extreme events. Model integrations with and without a stochastic\r\nbackscatter scheme would be conducted and extreme value statistics be used to determine\r\nthe impact of the scheme onto the occurrence of extreme events. For comparison, the same\r\nstatistic would be computed using the the ERA40, the ERA-Interim analysis and/or the\r\nNCEP/NCAR reanalysis as best proxy for multi-decadal observations.",
