 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary project defines what constitutes global competencies for engineers. It focuses on building knowledge and theory about global competencies in engineering that can be transferrable to other STEM disciplines. This project is constructing foundational knowledge on the complexities and multidimensionality of 'global competency.'  The long-term goal is to develop a shared understanding of what it means to be globally competent in STEM education. A plan is in place to develop a research-supported theoretical framework for defining outcome-based global engineering competencies with the specific goal of understanding stakeholders' perceptions. This research focuses on two specific stakeholder groups: 1) US trained engineers working outside of the US and 2) Employers who hire US trained engineers to work outside of the US. Ultimately, the research is expected to lead to the development of assessment instruments that can monitor both student readiness to be a global citizen and the effectiveness of the training programs.",
