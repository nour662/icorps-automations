 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developers of networked embedded systems often find it difficult to diagnose bugs. A key observation is that in such systems, it can be beneficial to exploit domain knowledge about events in the physical world to detect failures. For example, in a sensor network deployment, knowing that the received signal strength of a radio transmission will normally decrease over distance, the application developer can enforce runtime checks to detect faulty nodes based on their relative distances to the source and the orderings of their received signal strength.\r\n\r\nBased on this intuition, this project addresses the challenge of developing correct, resilient, and reliable networked embedded systems by (i) proposing, developing, and evaluating a methodology of using physical events to detect software bugs, (ii) developing software libraries and APIs to facilitate easy access to physical event constraints by application developers, and (iii) evaluating the effectiveness of the software libraries using real-world applications. \r\n\r\nThe completed framework could significantly reduce the debugging and maintenance costs for complicated networked embedded systems, and improve their reliability.  Beyond such direct social and economic benefits, the broader impacts of this work include: (i) improving curriculum with hands-on debugging sessions; (ii) raising interest in technology among high school seniors through a Pre-Collegiate Research Scholars Program; (iii) supporting talented female and under-represented minority PhD students to successfully accomplish their doctoral studies; (iv) disseminating research results through high-quality publications, high-profile tutorials, and open-source sites.",

This project aims to address several\nunique challenges related to embedded systems, as developers often\nfind it difficult to diagnose bugs in such systems, and to program\nthem for application purposes.  A key observation is that in such\nsystems, it can be beneficial to exploit domain knowledge about events\nin the physical world to detect failures. For example, in a sensor\nnetwork deployment, knowing that the received signal strength of a\nradio transmission will normally decrease over distance, the\napplication developer can enforce runtime checks to detect faulty\nnodes based on their relative distances to the source and the\norderings of their received signal strength.\n\nBased on this intuition, this project addresses the challenge of\ndeveloping correct, resilient, and reliable networked embedded\nsystems. The outcomes of this project is listed in two categories:\nresearch findings and outreach activities.\n\nIn the category of research findings, the main outcome is that,\nthrough collaboration of UMN and UTK, we complete a debugging protocol\ndesign called FIND, which addresses the detection of various types of\nbugs, not only including functional faults, where individual nodes may\ncrash, but also data faults, in which a node behaves normally in all\naspects except for its sensing results, leading to either significant\nbiased or random errors.

In the end of the run, FIND\nprovides a blacklist containing all possible faulty nodes. With such a\nlist, further recovery processes become possible.

These studies\nhave led to more than 10 publications in top conferences and journals.\n\nOn the side of outreach and education activities, the materials\ndeveloped by this project has been used in multiple courses: the CS560\n(advanced operating systems) the PI Cao developed and taught at UTK,\nCSCI4970W Advanced Project Laboratory the PI He taught for\nundergraduate students, and a graduate-level seminar course CSCI\n8211/8910 the PI He developed, in which students are required to read,\npresent and conduct research on related topics.  The PIs have given a\nfew talks in universities, workshop and conferences to disseminate the\nconcept of robust embedded programming and its related technologies.\nFinally, the PI He has hosted a few visiting scholar/postdoc who work\non related topics.\n\nThe project has also been used to generate interest among high school\nstudents, through a pre-college summer high school student program\noffered at UTK, where the PI Cao taught a group of high school\nstudents on writing correct programs on embedded platforms.
