CL imaging will support studies of  mineral growth history by allowing for visualization and mapping of crystal zoning and microstructural characteristics.  CL scanning using an SEM will support subsequent targeted elemental analysis and/or isotopic analysis of distinct growth rims using other electron microscopy techniques, secondary ion mass spectrometery or laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS).  The instrument will complement a recently NSF MRI supported laser ablation ICP-MS facility in the Department of Geoscience for zircon geochronology and trace element zonation in minerals and support a range of research in igneous and metamorphic petrology, impact processes, and analysis of clastic sedimentary and carbonate phases to elucidate the environmental conditions at the time of their deposition.   The CL microscope will support student research training across multiple departments on campus and the PIs seek to attract underrepresented students through an extant Alliance for Graduate Education and Professoriate (AGEP) program and a NASA Education grant targeted at encouraging undergraduate women to pursue science careers.   The instrument will also support collaborative research with faculty and students from nearby Cornell College, a regional liberal arts institution.  \r\n\r\n***",
