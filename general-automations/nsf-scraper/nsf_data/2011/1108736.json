 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this collaborative project the Principal Investigators (PIs) will\r\ninvestigate mathematical models for topological phases of matter and their\r\napplication to the nascent field of quantum information.  Examples of\r\ntopological phases of matter include Fractional Quantum Hall liquids and\r\ntopological insulators: materials subjected to extreme physical conditions\r\n(e.g. near zero Kelvin, under large magnetic forces) which appear to\r\nexhibit topological behavior.  The main objectives of the project are to\r\nbetter understand the taxonomy of these exotic states of matter through\r\nmathematical models, address physically and computationally motivated\r\nmathematical problems, and apply topological and algebraic methods to\r\nstudy them. For example, the issue of quantum computational power\r\n(universality) may be analyzed by finding the images of the braid groups\r\nunder representations associated to a particular model. Moreover, the\r\nextant hypothesized models for topological states of matter do not capture\r\nall of the subtleties (such as fermionic topological order) so the PIs\r\nwill develop new models.\r\n\r\nThe classical states of matter of solid, liquid and gas have more refined\r\nclassifications: for example, solid crystals may be differentiated by\r\ntheir symmetries.  Newly discovered topological materials have yet to be\r\nfully understood, but potentially can be used to build (quantum)\r\ncomputational devices out-performing standard micro-chip based computers.\r\nThe most commonly encountered model for quantum computation, the quantum\r\ncircuit model, requires challenging, if not impossible, accuracy on the\r\nhardware to be of practical value due to local interactions of the system\r\nwith the surrounding environment. The topological model based on exotic\r\nstates of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in\r\ntolerance for such interactions. The PIs will mathematically study these\r\nexotic states of matter focusing on their application to new computational\r\nparadigms with potentially significant benefit to society.",
