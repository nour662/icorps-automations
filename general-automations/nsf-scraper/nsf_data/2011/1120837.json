The enzymology of F420 dependent enzymes, such as FGD, has not yet been subject to rigorous investigation. The overall goal of this research is to understand the function and hydride transfer reactivity of FGD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis using site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), steady-state and pre-steady state methods. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will support the training of minority students in biochemistry. This work will also enhance the quality of education for participating students because they will acquire essential biochemical skills in the field of enzymology. As an African-American female, the PI is aware of the scarcity of under-represented groups in the scientific community and would like to provide mentoring opportunities to all students interested, including those from under-represented groups.",

The plasmid was transformed into C41(DE3) E. coli A detailed purification procedure has been published in Protein J. \n\nSuccessful Production of Cofactors FO and F420:  In collaboration with organic chemistry Prof. Frank Foss, a colleague at UTA, synthesis of FO, a catalytically active precursor of F420, was successfully achieved as documented by NMR spectra. There are several advantages to using the chemically synthesized FO precursor.  These include: a) synthetic FO production within two weeks (as opposed to 8 weeks when grown from cells). b) the newly synthesized FO is easily purified with significantly less contaminants than the published biosynthesis protocols of FO and F420 Cofactor c) the Foss protocol produces FO on a 50 mg quantity scale, as opposed to a few milligrams from the published protocols.  d) FO can be readily intercalated into Fno for kinetic studies with the enzyme. The PI, in collaboration with Dr. Foss has written a peer reviewed manuscript of this work, which has been published in Organic &amp; Biomolecular Chemistry Journal.\n\nInitial Kinetic Studies:  We have successfully employed steady state (Figure 12) and pre-steady state kinetic analysis of Fno. Furthermore, analysis of these data in terms of the initial rate of production of NADP clearly reveals biphasic kinetics, with the amplitude of the initial burst phase corresponding to 50% of FO reduction.  Our data steady state data suggest that this enzyme participates in negative cooperativity kinetics.  This phenomenon has not been seen previously with Fno, nor other F420 Cofactor dependent enzymes. Subsequently, using steady-state methods, a number of key parameters were determined, includi..."
