 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the collaborative research program of Prof. Barney Ellison and Prof. Daily of the University of Colorado and Prof. John Stanton of the University of Texas at Austin. This interdisciplinary collaborative team of investigators and their students will develop a novel biomass spectrometer that combines tunable vacuum ultraviolet photo ionization mass spectrometry (VUV PIMS) detection with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to study the fundamental chemical processes of forest fires. The project will combine state-of-the art spectroscopic methods to characterize the organic chemistry of reactive carbon species formed during biomass burning (Ellison), advanced spectral analysis methods to analyze infrared and mass spectra (Stanton) and computational fluid dynamics calculations and Monte Carlo simulations (Daily) to model the fluid dynamics of the planned biomass spectrometer. \r\n\r\nThe biomass spectrometer will enable the group to study the mechanism of biomass cracking during forest fires by identifying chemical intermediates and by-products of biomass burning.  The project will solve a very difficult and complex chemical problem and enable the interpretation of highly complex field data which is obtained during forest fires. The project will provide excellent interdisciplinary training opportunities for students who wish to pursue a professional scientific career in an area of great environmental importance.\r\n",

Short residence time flow reactors (roughly &le; 100 &mu;s) combined with suitable diagnostic tools have the potential to allow observation of unimolecular decomposition processes with minimum interference from secondary reactions. However, achieving the short residence times desired requires very small micro-reactors that are difficult to characterise experimentally because of their size. In this article the benefits of using these micro-reactors are presented along with some details of the systems employed. This is followed by some general flow considerations and then some simple analyses to illustrate particular features of t..."
