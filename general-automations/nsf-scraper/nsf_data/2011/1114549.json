 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proof-of-concept project is a collaboration of the Museum of Science in Boston, WGBH's National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM) and Ideum.  The project will demonstrate that the project team can design and develop digital interactive museum exhibit devices that work for visitors who have a wide range of disabilities.  The outcome will be one \"exemplar\" exhibit based on an exhibit scenario where museum visitors learn STEM concepts by manipulating and analyzing real data.  The project will also develop and test the efficacy of a prototype Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Toolkit that will help other museum professionals implement the digital interactive strategies.  In addition, the project will produce a white paper on the specific exemplar and a research paper with guidelines for digital interactive exhibits in museum.  \r\n\r\nThe project uses an innovative workshop approach that brings together individuals from a diverse range of fields to develop the digital interactive strategies.  After developing the \"exemplar\" exhibit, the team will develop the DIY Toolkit and test the efficacy of the Toolkit in museums that do not have the same level of exhibit development resources as larger institutions.  The the project's evaluation will not only determine if the exemplar works well with a wide range of people with disabilities, but also determine  the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of the workshop strategy and the ability of other museums to use the DIY toolkit.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will attend to an area of high need in the informal science education (ISE) museum exhibit community and provide a resource that will serve a wide range of ISE institutions.  If the project evaluation outcomes are positive, the project will lead to a larger effort to develop more exemplar exhibits based on different scenarios and an expansion of the DIY Toolkit.",
