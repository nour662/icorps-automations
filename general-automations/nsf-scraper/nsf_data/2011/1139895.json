CWSEM's responsibility included the provision of the logistical support to the women scientists and engineers as well as encouragement of their development as a cohort of women scientists that could become a support network for each other beyond the 2011 conference and training activities.\nTaking full advantage of the talent and ability of all men and women is a critical component in addressing the global challenges that currently confront all societies.  The US State Department conference Changing Mindsets to Promote Women and Girls in Science was structured to focus on topics that are relevant to all scientific and engineering disciplines and it was envisioned as a catalyst in encouraging greater collaboration among US federal agencies and non-profit organizations on their global efforts for girls and women in science, engineering, and medicine.\nParticipants had an opportunity to learn about:\n\nCutting edge practices that are helping to attract girls to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and support women in STEM, both in the US and internationally; \nWays in which societies can help empower women and girls through STEM;\nHow institutions in the developing world are working to overcome barriers to involvement in STEM, and how this makes a difference in the lives of women and girls; and\nHow the US government is helping women and girls in the developing world engage in STEM.\n\n\nThe women scientists and engineers also participated in a training program at the Fogarty International Center of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).  This program focused on skills that facilitate career progression in science and engineering and included sessions on mentoring, networking, and grant writing.

CWSEM has shared the knowledge acquired in this project with these organizations in an effort to increase regional engagement (with a focus on Africa and Latin America) of women scientists in training and mentoring projects as well as an enhanced understanding of needs and challenges facing women and girls in science globally.\n\nThis project also facilitated increased interaction with other  entities such as the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World (TWAS) and the Organization for Women ..."
