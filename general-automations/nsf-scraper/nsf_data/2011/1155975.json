This workshop, entitled EPSCoR 2030, will be a timely follow-up to the ?EPSCoR 2020: Expanding State Participation in Research in the 21st Century ? A New Vision for EPSCoR? workshop held in 2006 and seeks to review progress on recommendations from EPSCoR 2020 and make needed adjustments. In addition, EPSCoR 2030 seeks to continue the dialogue with NSF on a shared understanding of EPSCoR goals and metrics and the most effective actions to enhance research competitiveness nationally. \r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The EPSCoR 2030 Workshop will provide NSF senior management with recommendations for increasing the quality and broadening the scope of research in EPSCoR jurisdictions, for more effectively developing and utilizing their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) talent over the next decade, and for better targeting available funding to those jurisdictions for which the EPSCoR program can provide the largest incremental benefit to their research infrastructure. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Recommendations from the workshop are expected to prompt sustainable improvements in physical, human, and cyber infrastructure with EPSCoR jurisdictions as well as broader collaborative activities leading to collective solutions to challengers of regional and national importance.",
