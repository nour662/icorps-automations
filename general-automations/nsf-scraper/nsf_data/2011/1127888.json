 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ecosystem for Biophotonics Innovation (EBI) will accelerate the commercialization of some key biomedical technologies that have been created in the Center for Biophotonics (CBST), a NSF Science and Technology Center. To create this ecosystem, CBST, the Sacramento Area Regional Technology Alliance (SARTA, a regional economic development organization), 3rd party investor companies, a foundation and a national lab will formalize their R&D, education and commercialization alliance. EBI's primary intellectual merit stems from the development of a unique alliance of committed partners that will work collaboratively to translate research-based technologies to the marketplace. CBST develops technologies in response to end-user needs, but the EBI will actually lead to commercial products. In addition, the integration of an entrepreneurial education and mentorship program in the EBI will increase the innovation skills of faculty, postdoctoral entrepreneurial fellows, graduate and undergraduate students, indeed all members of the ecosystem. \r\n\r\nThe activities of the EBI will advance the commercialization of CBST technologies while providing hands-on training and learning. The resulting products will correspondingly enhance scientific discovery, promote better understanding of biophysical phenomena, and will ultimately improve patient care. EBI will enhance the participation of under-represented groups (URG) in the process of innovation and commercialization since CBST especially focuses on engaging URG Community College and undergraduate interns in its programs. EBI will foster the creation of new instrumentation, collaborative networks and partnerships. The results of the EBI program will be published in academic research journals, on a dedicated website, and presented in other public forums. Finally, the EBI will benefit society by producing new scientific instrumentation, medical devices, as well as the infrastructure to promote innovation and educate burgeoning entrepreneurs.",
