 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference is intended to jump-start a new field:  Comparative Decision Making Studies (CDMS).  CDMS will focus on the many ways that social, economic and computational decision making studies can leverage methods and results across disciplinary boundaries, especially the ways computational thinking can change the types of questions considered by social and economic scientists.\r\n\r\nThe conference will accomplish three goals, by facilitating a discussion among scholars from various academic backgrounds and individuals applying decision-making in society.  First, we will encourage transplanting techniques and insights across research programs and traditions, highlighting the similarities and differences among established approaches. Second, we will identify the most important current issues in decision making research and discuss how collaboration across disciplines and between academia and the consulting industry can facilitate the emergence of important new theories, empirical methods, and applications.  Finally, we will justify and promote the CDM approach in the scientific community and consulting industry.",
