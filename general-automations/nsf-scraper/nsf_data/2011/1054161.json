 "awd_abstract_narration": "****Technical Abstract*****\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award focuses on an investigation and optimization of electrophoretic deposition conditions of nanoparticles in suspension and of nanoparticle film-polymer film interactions to fabricate large surface area freestanding nanoparticle films.  The award also aims to characterize the mechanical properties of the freestanding nanoparticle films, such as the tensile strength and the Young's modulus, to probe how large the adhesion among nanoparticles can extend in the macroscopic scale.  For some of the nanoparticle films, like the Fe3O4 nanocrystal films, the magnetic properties of the ensemble, such as the magnetic dipolar coupling, can be probed.  Characterization of magnetic properties can provide substantial insight into the coupling between such magnetic nanoparticles.  This new class of materials is likely to stimulate the development of wholly novel varieties of composite materials and device applications, such as anti-corrosion and anti-fogging coatings and freestanding, flexible video display devices.  Diverse and underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students, as well as high school students and secondary school educators, will participate in this project thanks to existing programs, such as the Fisk-Vanderbilt Masters-to-PhD Bridge Program.\r\n\r\n****Non Technical Abstract****\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award focuses on a study of the assembly and the characteristics of free-standing and transportable macroscopic materials formed from collections of nanomaterials.  The investigation seeks to optimize the conditions for nanoparticles in a solution and for nanoparticles in film form, such that the fabrication of films of nanomaterials in macroscopic sizes can be achieved.  The award also aims to characterize the mechanical properties of the freestanding nanoparticle films, such as the tensile strength, to probe how strong these nanostructured materials can be.  Characterization of magnetic properties can provide substantial insight into the coupling between magnetic nanoparticles.  This new class of materials is likely to stimulate wide ranging technical developments and device applications, such as anti-corrosion and anti-fogging coatings and freestanding, flexible video display devices.  Diverse populations of underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students, as well as high school students and secondary school educators, will participate in this project thanks to existing programs, such as the Fisk-Vanderbilt Masters-to-PhD Bridge Program.",
