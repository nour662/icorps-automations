 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continued support for the hadron collider-physics program of the experimental high-energy physics group at Northeastern University, Darien Wood - PI, for a three-year period. The intellectual merit follows from the new era of discovery and understanding which has and will continue to progress in the field of particle physics. The group works on two large experiments: the D\u00d8 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron and the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. With a carefully balanced effort, the group plans to continue to make major contributions to each experiment, to clarify the status of a Standard Model low-mass Higgs at D\u00d8 and to explore dramatic signatures of new physics at CMS. The broader impact includes the education and mentoring of postdoctoral associates and graduate students and continued involvement in the Boston Area QuarkNet program as well as the cooperative education program at Northeastern University which allows the group to routinely involve undergraduates in six-month projects at CERN.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur group from Northeastern University exploited the data from the DZero experiment at the Tevatron Collider at Fermilab and the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN to get a better understanding of how subatomic particles and fields work at a fundamental level. \n\nThe discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC was a great breakthrough in 2012, and it led us to pursue questions that previously had not been possible to address.  Did this new boson decay into quarks as well as photons and Z bosons?  We studied the Tevatron data, where there was an indication of Higgs decays into b-quarks.  Might this Higgs decay into Dark Matter, or other invisible particles?  For this, we studied the data from the CMS experiment at LHC.  With the current data from the LHC, we were not able to see any evidence of invisible Higgs boson decays, but we were able to say that this sort of decay happens less than about half of the time.  This limit on the invisible decays already tells us interesting things about Dark Matter.   For some of the lower possible values of the unknown mass of the Dark Matter particles, the limits from Higgs boson decay are more restrictive than those from underground Dark Matter detectors.\n\nWe know that quarks (the building blocks of hadrons like protons and neutrons) and leptons (electrons, muons, taus, and neutrinos) each come in three generations, but why?  No one really knows the answer.  If a particle called a leptoquark exists, it would explain why the quark and lepton generations are aligned.  The best place to look for leptoquarks is at the LHC.  We used the full power of the CMS data from 2011 and 2012, and we saw no signs of leptoquarks.  This tells us that they must be quite massive, probably more than 1000 times more massive than the proton.  We are prepared to search again when the LHC resumes collisions at even higher energy.\n\nIn order to find new particle and phenomena, we need to understand very well the existing processes of known particles from the standard model of particle physics.  We made careful studies of some particular processes, namely production of pairs of Z bosons, and production of W bosons accompanied by jets of hadrons.  These processes can form backgrounds in searches for things like the Higgs boson and leptoquarks, and by improving our knowledge of these known processes, we are able to make more sensitive searches for unknown processes.\n\nIn order to study collision at the LHC, we need very powerful detectors, and the detectors need to evolve and improve with the increasing energy and intensity of the LHC.  During the shutdown period of the LHC at the end of Run 1, we worked to improve the electronics which read out the muon detection system in CMS.  With this upgrade in place, we will be able to be more sensitive to any signatures for new physics that produce muons.  This work on the muon detectors at CERN was a large enterprise in itself, where 72 chambers were brought to the surface for refurbishing and months of testing before going back underground.  This required a coordinated effort of physicists, engineers, technicians, and was a great training environment for our students.\n\nPublic access to the results of this research is essential.  We helped to guide some of our results into open-access journals that are available on the web free of charge.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Darien R Wood"
