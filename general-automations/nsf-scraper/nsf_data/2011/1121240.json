 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  Every time the genome is replicated, the epigenetic state, which is controlled by chromatin organization, is either maintained to retain cell identity or reset to establish a new cell identify. The pathways regulating replication-coupled packaging of DNA into chromatin are largely unknown.  This research is aimed at understanding how proteins involved in this process interact with each other during DNA replication to ensure proper maintenance of epigenetic states and maintenance of genome integrity. Genetic, biochemical and single-molecule strategies will be applied to define the relationships among members of this evolutionarily conserved replication-coupled chromatin assembly network in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These results will be important for uncovering how this network is organized at the levels of protein-protein interactions, the sub-cellular location and the timing of these interactions, and connections between multiple pathways within this network. Mechanisms revealed by the research will contribute to understanding how the chromatin assembly network enables downstream genome-dependent processes, including: formation of silent chromatin, which inactivates gene expression; maintenance of appropriate chemical modifications on histones; and resistance to DNA damage. In addition, the research will produce broadly applicable strategies for measuring protein-protein interactions in single, living or fixed cells or in cell extracts at the single-molecule level.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   The research will continue to encourage entry and promote retention of students in science. This research will be conducted primarily by graduate and undergraduate students and will provide an excellent opportunity for cross-disciplinary training in the fields of Biochemistry, Genetics and Biophysics. Graduate trainees will receive mentoring on career development, scientific writing, presentation and Problem Based Learning teaching strategies while conducting the proposed research. Trainees will share their findings with the broader scientific community by presenting their results at departmental, university-wide and international meetings, as well as in written publications.",
