 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this collaborative research project is to develop a rational approach to bridge fire safety assessment by developing a fundamental understanding of the performance of steel girder bridge systems when exposed to fire.  In recent years there has been a growing concern regarding fire hazard in bridges.  Steel bridges are highly susceptible to fire induced damage and even collapse, since steel loses its strength and stiffness at high temperatures.  The specific objectives are to (1) determine the parameters that affect the bridge vulnerability in a fire, (2) recommend means for mitigating the destructive effects of fire, (3) develop a qualitative strategy for classifying bridges based on fire risk, and (4) determine the post-fire residual strength.  Experimental and numerical studies will be performed through collaboration between Princeton University and Michigan State University.  This research will develop fundamental knowledge that is necessary to move forward with bridge fire safety provisions, and it will develop practical knowledge that practicing engineers need to make fast informed decisions after a bridge fire event.  Guidelines will be developed for mitigating fire-induced collapse in steel bridge girders.\r\n\r\nThe guidelines developed are expected to lead to optimum and fire safe designs that are not only economical but are also based on rational design principles.  Currently, bridge design regulations provide detailed specifications about how to design for loads such as earthquakes, but relatively much less information is available on how to design a bridge for a severe fire.  This research will form the basis for developing design guidelines to provide improved fire safety and contribute to the development of US codes and standards dealing with the fire hazard in bridge girders.  The PIs will disseminate this work to practicing engineers though publications and presentations at seminars and conferences.  The project will also provide advanced training to graduate students on the topic of fire effects on structures through their involvement in the research activities of this project.",

The specific objectives and outcomes of this research were: (1) Determine the parameters that most affect the bridge vulnerability in a fire; (2) Propose means for mitigating the effects of fire; (3) Develop a qualitative strategy for classifying bridges based on fire risk; and (4) Determine the post-fire strength.  To reach these objectives a collaborative research project between Princeton University and Michigan State University was undertaken. The work involved complex nonlinear finite element models as well as fire resistance experiments that were state-of-the-art (never been done before).\n\nA literature review at the project origin revealed that bridge fires are a major concern due to the number of fire events and the social and economic consequences; but not many studies had been carried out on this topic.  Therefore, the project results (significant findings), as outlined next, (1) advance the knowledge &ndash; intellectual merit, and (2) have important benefits for society &ndash; broader impact.\n\nThe significant project outcomes as related to the objectives are as follows:\n\n(1) Fires can pose a significant hazard to steel bridges. Under severe fires such as hydrocarbon fires that result when a gasoline tanker crashes near a bridge, the fire resistance of steel girders could be less than 35 minutes. The failure time and mode of failure is highly influenced by web slenderness of girder, fire intensity, fire exposure scenario, web slenderness, load level, span length, and axial restraint at supports. \n\n(2) Failure through web shear buckling in steel bridge girders results in lower fire resistance as compared to a situation where flexural loading is the dominant failure limit state. Therefore, a bridge girder will have lower fire resistance when the support zone of steel girders is exposed to fire, as compared to mid-span zone. \n\n(3) The parameter that most affects the bridge vulnerability in a fire is the temperature reached in the steel.   To this end, it is recommended that new fire protection materials be studied that can withstand harsh environmental conditions.  \n\n(4) Deep steel girder bridges are especially vulnerable to shear buckling.  The traditional closed-form solution (model) used to predict the ultimate capacity of web shear buckling at ambient temperature does not give good predictions at elevated temperatures.  A new formula was developed based on the compression that builds on the plate diagonal. This approach is novel since all existing web shear buckling models are based on the tensile response and results show that a compression model leads to better predictions than a tension model. \n\n(5) Stainless steel has a lower thermal conductivity and thus experiences lower temperatures than carbon steel.  Using stainless steel can increase the time to failure by up to 87% more than carbon steel.  This improved behavior of stainless is mostly due to its superior mechanical properties at elevated temperatures, not the thermal properties.\n\n(6) The orientation and fire protection of vertical stiffeners was also examined as a means to mitigate the effects of fire.  Providing thermal protection for the vertical stiffeners alone has a minimal beneficial effect on the ulti..."
