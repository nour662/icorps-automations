 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will explore the efficient and rapid consensus building systems among citizens within and across countries, and examine how such a large scale of self-organized citizens can be mobilized in a short period of time with common goals.  In the Arabic countries, an intensive campaign of civil resistance has spread rapidly from country to country. Starting in December 2010 in Tunisia, it spread to Egypt, Algeria, Yemen, Iran, Bahrain, Libya and Morocco. Both mainstream media and social media agree that it is the largest citizen protest in human history, and debate that social media has caused a revolution in Arabic countries.  In this proposed research, we will study two issues. First, we propose to investigate information diffusion speed through social media. Second, we propose to explore the emergence and organization of mechanisms of its diffusion and collective intelligence within social media space. To measure the information diffusion speed, we will apply the curve fitting regression method.  What we observe today is not just the spread of civil protests from one city to another, but also from one country to another, on a day to day basis. We believe that this type of large scale protest cannot be enabled without the extremely mobile and fast information delivery and sharing systems that are available on a global scale. To assess the patterns of emergence, organization, and spread of social reporting we will run social network analyses. This will be done at two different levels: one within country, and the second across countries. Data must be collected rapidly because it is ephemeral. \r\n\r\nExamining cross-border information spread will enable us to better understand how social media can de-construct the territory based traditional concept of national borders.  This research will contribute to knowledge by throwing new light on the way of harnessing citizens' potential at the collective level to bring about social changes.  Specifically, this research will attempt to understand the co-evolution pattern of information diffusion speed, self-organization of protesters, and communication technology and will empirically show the potential of collective social media.",

We trace how Twitter communications develop spontaneously over time during the political crisis of the 2011 Egypt revolution, particularly during and around the January 25th demonstration. Applying the \"milling\" and \"keynoting\" concepts of Emergent Norm Theory to the social media context, we suggest a sequential crisis communication framework of IVS (Improvisation, Verification, and Solidification).

We first review how historians analyze the role of print technology during the Protestant Reformation in the early 16th century. Through this review, we argue that (1) revolutionary ideas (like Martin Luther\u00c6s) cannot be revolutionary unless it is distributed, shared and supported by many others, and (2) efficient communication technologies are essential to distribute and share revolutionary ideas with a large number of others. We find that the historians\u00c6 approach bears similarity with that of sociomateriality, and offers a useful angle for our study. Following the historians\u00c6 approach and using the sociomateriality perspective, we analyze retweet communication patterns to determine (1) how influential figures emerge among a multitude of online individuals, and (2) what are the implications of the emergence of multiple connections.
