The purpose of the trip is to develop a collaborative research project on a new generation of automated assembly and manufacturing technologies by applying so-called screw theory to the automation of machine movement in multiple dimensions or degrees of freedom. This planning visit will be the basis for preparation of a full-scale collaborative-research proposal.\r\n\r\nThis activity is aimed to develop innovative and more efficient manufacturing techniques that can make positive economic contributions in both countries. Such techniques can make the US more competitive on the global market. Participation in this project will also prepare US engineering students to be engaged globally.",
