The focus of the workshop is to ensure that indigenous peoples' perspectives on global environmental change and their adaptation strategies are fully taken into account in the next IPCC Assessment report. The purpose of this specific request is to ensure that Arctic indigenous people have a chance not only to interact with scientific community to discuss issues of global environmental change, but also to relate their own experiences, challenges, and strategies for ensuring the long term sustainability of their communities in the Arctic. The proposed funding is entirely in Participant Support Costs and will support the travel and participation of Arctic indigenous scholars to the workshop.",
