The probe can be used for diagnosis of coronary artery disease which is the No. 1 killer in USA.  It can assess the stent effectiveness and diagnose misplacement of stents which occurs in 66.5% of the 1 million coronary artery disease patients each year.  Other applications include structural health monitoring, surveillance in unmanned miniature vehicles, and navigation in autonomous intelligence robotics. 2) Educational initiatives will broaden participation of the underrepresented groups, especially female students.",
