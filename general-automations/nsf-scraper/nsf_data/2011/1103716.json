 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology.  The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Melissa Pespeni is \"Revealing the genetic underpinnings of morphological diversity in horned dung beetles.\" The host institution for this research is Indiana University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Armin Moczek.\r\n\r\nHorned dung beetles in the genus Onthophagus are the most speciose genus in the world, with some 2000 species described.  These beetles originated in Africa and diversified with the diversification of mammals by feeding on the dung of specific mammal species.  Most interestingly, species differ with radical variations in horn morphology, changing the size, shape and number of horns developing from their heads and thorax.  Several genes that are known to be important in the development of other insects that lack these novel horn structures have been identified as critical for the development of diverse horn morphologies in dung beetles. Recently developed genomic and gene expression information make Onthophagus beetles a useful model for developmental biology in general and a valuable biological system for this study of the genetic underpinnings of morphological diversity and gene expression at various stages of development and in morphologically distinct yet closely related species. The scientific impacts include determining the genetic basis of evolutionary change that enables or constrains adaptive evolution and evolutionary responses on a changing planet.\r\n\r\nTraining objectives include learning developmental genetic techniques and applying genome-wide studies in a comparative, evolutionary, and developmental framework.  Broader impacts of this fellowship include assisting conservation efforts and inspiring interest in biology when shared in K-12 classrooms, with undergraduates, at conferences, and in popular and scientific publications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRevealing the genetic underpinnings of morphological diversity in horned dung beetles\n\nThere are more beetle species described than anything else living on this planet.  In particular, horned dung beetles in the genus Onthophagus have over 2400 described species.  These beetles originated in Africa and diversified with the diversification of mammals as many specialize on feeding themselves and their young on the dung of a particular mammal species.  Most interestingly, species differ from each other with radical variations in horn morphology, changing the size, shape and number of horns that develop from their head and thorax.  In addition, species differ in their degree of within species variation.  For most species, males have horns, while females do not, and most species have two, nutritionally determined male morphs. Well-fed, large-bodied males develop large horns and fight for access to mating opportunites, while poorly-fed, small-bodied males develop small horns and sneak copulations. Several genes have been identified as critical for the development of diverse horn morphologies, but these gene candidates have been limited to those that have been shown to be important in the development of other insects that lack these novel horn structures. \n\nThis project compared the gene sequences of three Onthophagus species that have diverged along three axes that encompass the diversity represented across the genus: orientation of the sexual dimorphism, degree of sensitivity in the male nutritional polyphenism, and position of horns on the body. By developing transcriptomic resources and comparative analytical approaches, Dr. Pespeni identified the genes that have been subject to natural selection in the evolution of these lineages.  Most of the genes were related to axis patterning, tissue development, and growth, Nodal, ADAMTS3, a fibroblast growth factor receptor protein, and sulfur metabolism gene, SQR. These all represent new gene candidates that match predictions for genes underlying this morphological diversity based on their known function in other organisms and the function of related genes that have been studied in Onthophagus beetles.  One of the most exciting results from this study was that the same genes that underlie morphological diversity within a species, i.e. those that were differentially expressed between sexes, morphs, and tissues, were also highly diverged between species where expected if the species pair had also diverged along that axis, i.e. the orientation of the sexual dimorphism, the degree of sensitivity to nutrition in generating alternative phenotypes, and the position on the body of the horns.  These results were among the few to show that the genes and pathways that underlie morphological diversity within a species were the same as those that underlie morphological divergence between species.  This suggests that variation within a species due to context-specific expression (specific sex, morph, or tissue) could facilitate divergence between species.\n\nIn another study, Dr. Pespeni compared three rapidly diverging populations on three continents in the bull-headed beetle, Onthophagus taurus. About 50 years ago, O. taurus was deliberately introduced to Australia from its native Mediterranean region by farmers to remove cow patties and in turn reduce the abundance of fly pests.  Soon after, O. taurus was accidentally introduced in the south eastern United States.  In this short period of time, the introduced beetle populations have differentiated in opposite directions from their native Mediterranean ancestors in the relationship of body size to horn size.  In the U.S., there are many small males with large horns, whereas in Australia, a male must be very large in order to develop large horns.  Dr. Pespeni sequenced the transcriptomes of four developmental stages for males and females from each of the three populations to test for allele frequency and gene expression differences that might be evolvi..."
