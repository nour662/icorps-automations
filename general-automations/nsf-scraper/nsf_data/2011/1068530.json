The intellectual merit focuses on key questions in Electroweak Symmetry Breaking and the potential existence of new particles. The proposed research using the BaBar data set will advance our understanding of Standard Model physics and provide students with opportunities to engage in high quality data analyses. The broader impact includes the education and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students and continued involvement in the UC QuarkNet program as well as beneficial contributions in intensive computing and medical applications.",
