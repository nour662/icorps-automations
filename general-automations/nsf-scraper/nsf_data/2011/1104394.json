 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\nThe properties of the quasiparticles in the fractional quantum Hall states are different from those of non-interacting particles, which are either Fermions or Bosons. It is predicted that in most fractional quantum Hall states the interchange of quasiparticles results in a change of the wave function by a phase factor that is a complex number, with magnitude one, but different from +/-1, as for Fermions and Bosons. Even more surprising is the possibility, for a special state at filling fraction i= 5/2, that interchange of the particles does not simply change the wave function's phase, but results in a completely different wave function.  For this case, the statistics are called non-Abelian.  To determine the statistics of quasiparticles requires building an interferometer, in which the quasiparticles can travel on two distinct paths to the detector. Experiments are proposed to study the tunneling process by which the particles access the two paths, and, once it is understood, to create an interferometer to test the ideas about non-Abelian statistics.  This research could contribute to the development of strategies for quantum computing.  The education of graduate students and postdoctoral scientists in the kind of research proposed here is very valuable.  By learning nano-fabrication techniques, ultra-low temperature physics techniques, as well as thinking deeply about fundamental physics issues, young people become extremely valuable to small and large businesses, as well as to academia.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abstract\r\nResearch is proposed to study a novel system, which might be the basis of a quantum computer.  It has been shown that such a computer could solve problems that conventional computers cannot.  For example, a classical computer cannot factor very large numbers into its prime factors.  This fact is used to protect our bank accounts and many of the Nation's defense secrets.  However, a quantum computer could do this.  No one has built such a quantum computer yet, but if it can be done, it is important for us to do it in the US first, so that new approaches to security can be found.  The work proposed here is to study a system, which might be useful for quantum computing.  When electrons are forced to move in only two dimensions inside semiconductors and are placed in a strong magnetic field, they form a kind of liquid, with special properties.  The liquid acts as though it is made of new particles, instead of electrons, and these new particles may be used for quantum computing.  Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers working on this project will learn semiconductor technology as well as learning the deep physics of quantum mechanics.  This will prepare them to work in small and large corporations on forefront technologies that will make the Nation more competitive.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe have been studying electrons confined to move in two dimensions.  This is accomplished by growing special crystals containing different materials, Aluminum-Gallium-Arsenide (AlGaAs) and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), adjacent to each other.  Electrons accumulate at the interface between the AlGaAs and the GaAs and can only move parallel to the interface.  In a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the interface and at very low temperatures, only a few percent of one degree above absolute zero, the electrons form new states, which behave like liquids, but with very strange properties.  When we apply an electric field parallel to the interface, the liquid acts as though it is made of particles that have charges that are a fraction of e, the charge of the electron in free space; we call these quasiparticles.  Furthermore, whereas exchanging two electrons in free space has only very small effects on the system, exchanging quasiparticles may have major impacts.  In particular, for one of these states, called the 5/2 fractional quantum Hall state, there are several competing theoretical descriptions, in some of which, exchanging quasiparticles would completely change the state of the system.  It has been proposed that this would make the 5/2 state a good candidate to be used in a quantum computer.  We have measured the behavior of the quasiparticles in this state, and our results point to a different theoretical description than the one useful for quantum computation.\n\nWe have also studied how the two dimensional gas behaves when we confine it in an electric field applied perpendicular to the interface but periodic along the interface.  We have used nano-lithography to make nanometer size electrodes on the surface to create this potential.  This causes the energies of the electrons to go up and down periodically from point to point at the interface between the AlGaAs and the GaAs.  We find evidence that the electrons in this case undergo a transition as a function of the field we apply along the interface.  At low field the electrons cannot move, but above a critical field that start moving.  We think the entire collection of electrons start sliding together along the surface when the field is strong enough. \n\nThese basic science studies are motivated by other discoveries made by physicists.  We want to understand the fundamental physics of how electrons behave as the dimensionality of their motion is reduced from 3 to 2 to 1.  Whether such studies will lead to useful technologies is not predictable.  However, in the past research into solid state physics has often led to technologies that are the basis of the electronics, communications, and computing industries.  These studies have also provided education for undergraduate and graduate students who have gone on to careers in research and education, in large and small companies, in large research universities and small teaching colleges.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/04/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marc A Kastner"
