 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this proof of concept study is to evaluate the contribution of Subterranean Groundwater Discharge (SGD) in the Arctic to the global methane budget. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and large natural reservoirs exist in Arctic soils and permafrost. The working hypothesis is that methane released from thawing permafrost in the Arctic is transported via groundwater flow (above and below the permafrost layer) and enters the atmosphere via coastal waters and lakes. This source of methane may be realized as an important source of natural methane to the atmosphere and may provide a positive feedback to global warming.\r\nThe objectives of the study are: \r\n1) To estimate the magnitude of subterranean groundwater discharge and associated methane flux into lakes and coastal waters in Alaska at three representative sites. \r\n2) To evaluate methane evasion rates from the water column to the atmosphere. \r\n3) To determine if the contribution of methane input from subterranean groundwater discharge to the global methane budget is significant, and if so \r\n4) To use the preliminary data to design a more through research plan that will enable precise estimates of fluxes and provide a basis for global extrapolation of results such that the contribution of this source to current and future climate changes and the global methane budget will be possible.\r\nThe project will support a graduate student full time for two years. Undergraduate students in the ACCESS program and the California Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Engineering and Mathematics program at UCSC will also participate in the proposed work. The PIs will work with COSEE Alaska to ntegrate this work in their outreach and education activities including teacher workshops, symposia, and work with local communities in Alaska.",

Methane emissions from the Arctic may be particularly important because the Arctic is a large reservoir for methane. Methane concentrations are very high in Arctic soil, permafrost and groundwater. One way by which methane can be transported to the atmosphere is if groundwater delivers methane to lakes and the coastal ocean. In this study we show that methane-rich groundwater from the seasonally thawed active layer in the Arctic flows into Toolik Lake, and into both the North Pacific (Kasitsna Bay) and Arctic Ocean (Barrow) coastal zones. This may be an important previously unrecognized conduit for methane transport and emissions in the Arctic. The controls on methane input from the active layer are fundamentally different than those affecting methane production within lakes or the coastal ocean water, and the response of these processes to climate and environmental change is also distinct. The accuracy of predictions of methane emissions and ultimately the extent of climate change that can be expected in the Arctic depend on a better understanding of methane dynamics in the region, including the controls over methane production and transport processes within the active layer. Therefore better understanding of the processes affecting methane concentrations in groundwater and their discharge to water bodies is needed.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/05/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Adina&nbsp;Paytan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1114485/1114485_10078271_1459891709003_Report--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1114485/1114485_10078271_1459891709003_Report--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Groundwater discharge in the Arctic\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1114485/1114485_10078271_1459891709003_Report--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Groundwater discharge in the Arctic\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Conceptual south-north cross section of Alaska indicating the three research areas of this study</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">N.
