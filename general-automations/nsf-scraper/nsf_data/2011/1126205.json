 "awd_abstract_narration": "This MRI award funds the acquisition of a LSM710 laser scanning confocal microscope to\r\nsupport research and training in plant signaling at the University of North Texas by providing\r\nimaging capabilities that are required for molecular and biochemical studies at the cellular and\r\nsub-cellular levels. In addition, the confocal microscope will enhance research and training in\r\ndevelopmental physiology, eco-toxicology, neurobiology and microbiology. The LSM710 will\r\ncome equipped with a 34-channel spectral detector that will facilitate studying the in situ\r\nexpression pattern of genes, intracellular protein localization and protein-protein interactions,\r\nchanges in Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and sugar fluxes, and macromolecular dynamics.\r\nBroader Impacts: The LSM710 will benefit undergraduate and graduate students and post-docs\r\nby providing them training in the application of imaging technology for research and\r\ndevelopment. The confocal microscope will also provide opportunities to encourage and\r\nbroaden the participation and training in the Life Sciences of underrepresented minorities, high\r\nschool-aged students and future secondary teachers through the McNair program, the Teach\r\nNorth Texas program, the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, the Honors College, the\r\nNSF S-STEM supported (#0807128) Fostering Outstanding Cohorts in Undergraduate Science\r\n(FOCUS) Scholarships program, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate\r\nScience Education program at the University of North Texas. The LSM710 will support\r\nresearch by these students. The instrument will positively impact the environment and society\r\nby supporting research on the discovery, function and application of signaling mechanisms in\r\nplants, which will augment sustainable agriculture, industry and renewable natural resources.",
