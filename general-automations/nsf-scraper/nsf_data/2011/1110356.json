The objective of this workshop is to enable future CISE proposal submitters to prepare competitive CAREER proposals. The major components of the workshop include presentations on NSF proposal guideline and proposal writing, experience sharing, mock panels, and proposal clinic. The workshop intends to provide young faculty with skills in proposal writing, panel review experience, and opportunities to interact with NSF program directors and recent NSF CAREER awardees. This workshop will also provide travel support to encourage junior faculty members at HBCU/MEI to participate the NSF CAREER proposal writing practice.\r\nIntellectual merit\r\n\r\nMajor activities of the workshop include: presentations by NSF program directors, invited speakers, and recent NSF CAREER awardees; mock panel review sessions; interactions among workshop participants, NSF program directors, and recent NSF CAREER awardees; and proposal clinic. The workshop materials will be available in workshop website and the presentations in the workshop will be podcasted via the internet.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\n\r\nThe workshop will be open to participants from U.S. national universities (including HBCU/MEI). About 100 junior faculty members (about 16 or more of them are from HBCU/MEI) across the nation are expected to attend the workshop. They will learn the guidelines and obtain experience of writing a competitive NSF CAREER proposal. This will positively affect these young faculty members at their early career stage to develop their academic career as outstanding researchers and educators.",
