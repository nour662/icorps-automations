 "awd_abstract_narration": "Leaves are an important food source for organisms living in streams.  When leaves fall into streams fungi and bacteria begin to break them down, making them a good food source for insects and fish.  Although hundreds of studies show that leaves from different plant species decompose at different rates, the consequences of these differences are not well understood. This project tests if differences among riparian plant species affect pathways of energy flow in stream food webs, with consequences for microbial diversity and transfer of nutrients to insects and fish. In particular, the investigators will test the non-intuitive hypothesis that leaves that decompose more slowly provide a better food source to organisms higher in the food web than quickly decomposing leaves.  This work will advance the field by providing a framework for predicting how variation in plants living on stream banks affects major energy pathways in stream food webs.\r\n  \r\nThis research is important for managing and restoring streams.  Managers spend millions of dollars each year re-vegetating riparian zones but need better information on what to plant and how different trees will affect the health and functioning of streams. This study will provide the information needed to fill this knowledge gap.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main purpose of this research study is for scientists to better understand how the kinds of leaves found in freshwater streams, called leaf litter, affect bacteria and fungi that are in the streams.  The scientists thought that leaves that decompose easier would be associated with different types of bacteria and fungus than leaves that took longer to break down.\n\nTwo papers were published from the work that was done using the money from this NSF grant.  In the first study, called \"Contrasting rRNA Gene Abundance Patterns for Aquatic Fungi and Bacteria in Response to Leaf-Litter Chemistry\", the researchers tested bacterial and fungal levels in fresh water leaf litter.  Leaf litter was collected from 2 kinds of cottonwood trees: Populus fremontii (P. fremontii) and Populus angustifolia (P. angustifolia).  These cottonwoods were chosen because their leaves decompose at different rates.  P. fremontii decomposes more quickly than P. angustifolia.  The leaves from these two trees were put into bags that were placed in the headwaters of Oak Creek in Arizona.  The scientists took the bags out of the stream after 6, 14 and 28 days.  The researchers then looked to see how much bacteria and fungi were in each bag.\n\nThis study showed that bacteria were highest on day 6, with bacteria being higher in the leaves that more easily decomposed (the P. fremontii leaves).   After 14 days, bacteria decreased in both kinds of leaf litter and remained low for the rest of the study.  In contrast, fungi were highest on the leaves that took longer to decompose (the P. angustifolia leaves) and this was true for the whole 28 days of the study.  Fungus was highest in both leaf litter types after 14 days.  These data show that bacteria are particularly active during early decomposition of litter (leaves that decompose quickly), while fungi prefer to grow on leaves that decompose more slowly.\n\nThe most recent paper, entitled \"Contrasting rRNA Gene Abundance Patterns for Aquatic Fungi and Bacteria in Response to Leaf-Litter Chemistry\" builds on the study described above.  In this experiment, leaf litter was collected from 6 different P. angustifolia trees and 4 different P. fremontii trees.  Bags of leaf litter were created, mixing litter from 3 trees from each kind of cottonwood.  The bags were put into Oak Creek and taken out at 6, 14 and 28 days.  In this study, the researchers extracted the bacterial DNA from the leaf samples and sequenced the DNA to determine which kinds of bacteria were in each bag.   \n\nBy day 14, two different kinds of bacteria: Bacteroidetes and &beta;-proteobacteria were most common on the decomposing leaves, and Verrucomicrobia and &alpha;- and &delta;-proteobacteria were also in the leaf samples and increased over time.  There were no significant differences in the kinds of bacteria that were in bags with leaves from different trees of the same species (P. fremontii or P. angustifolia). Bacterial communities (groups of bacteria living in the leaves) were different, depending on what kind of cottonwood was in the bag. The P. fremontii leaves, which decompose most quickly, had a greater number of different bacterial species than slow decomposing P. angustifolia litter. These results show that stream leaf litter bacterial communities changes rapidly over time and are influenced by leaf species and how quickly they decompose.\n\nThese studies will help scientists to understand better the relationship between leaf litter in freshwater streams and the bacteria and fungi that are present during decomposition.  This is important because the decomposition of leaves in freshwater streams is crucial to providing nutrients for animals and other plants that live in this ecosystem. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/25/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lance Price"
