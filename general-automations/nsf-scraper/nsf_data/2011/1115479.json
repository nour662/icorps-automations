GES-9 with about 150 international participants is a triennial meeting sponsored by the International Association of GeoChemistry (IAGC) and will be held at the University of Colorado, Boulder, June 3-7, 2011. The International Critical Zone Student Symposium will take place June 1-2, 2011. The goal is to train students to find the connections across spatial scales and disciplinary boundaries through in-depth presentations by leading scientists, exposure to new field sites, and discussions with colleagues around the world. All of these will happen for students in the focused week of activities associated with GES-9.\r\n\r\nThis award will directly support 15 young researchers and help them establish community with other critical zone researchers. A similar number of students from the SoilTrEC (Soil Transformations in European Catchments) project in Europe will participate in the event.",

The Broader Impacts of the project stem from supporting early career scientists to attend and participate in an international meeting (GES-9).  Furthermore, the pre-meeting International Critical Zone Student Symposium provided a forum for these young scientists to forge connections with their peers across the country and in Europe.  Afterwards, participants reported favorably on their experiences:  \"I definitely had many new ideas stirring in my mind\"   \"I was inspired\"   \"I had a lot of good interactions at my poster both with full fledged scientists and students\"   \"it was very effective in fulfilling a number of goals\"    \"the student symposium was an incredible experience\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/03/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Suzanne P Anderson"
