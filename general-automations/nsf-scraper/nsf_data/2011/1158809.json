 "awd_abstract_narration": "In-forest biomass processing is being broadly promoted to address the costs associated with transporting low-value biomass to central facilities. However, current approaches for scaling-down conventional process technologies are unlikely to result in sufficiently low costs for accessing most woody debris resources. Previous research led to the development of a low capital cost, engineered blanket pyrolysis system that is used to convert forest residue into carbonaceous biochar through temperature-controlled slow pyrolysis. The technology is simple enough to be operated by existing fire-crews, keeping operating costs low. The team has demonstrated this approach for biochar production from as much as 500 lbs of wood. Preliminary studies are consistent with prior literature, showing that biochar can serve as a high value soil amendment or greener alternative to coal.  The team has secured an initial supply of woody debris and has initiated discussions with potential customers. \r\n\r\nThe team will use the funds to commercialize this technology to address the major ecological and societal challenges posed by slash, while reducing the cost to landowners. The current plan for the commercialization of this technology involves two strategies 1) the direct service of slash removal and 2) bringing biochar to the market as a soil amendment and landscaping material. Understanding scale-dependent processes in the new technology, and showing its applicability at a scale relevant to forestry operations, will significantly advance the engineering science and commercial potential of this NSF-funded research.",
