 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) award, the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) Program in the Division of Chemistry is supporting collaborative work by Professor Carey Johnson of the University of Kansas and Professor Bernhard Dick of the University of Regensburg, Germany.  This award is through a partnership with the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), who will support the research in the Dick lab.  The international team will carry out fundamental studies on the light-activated signaling process that triggers phototropism, the process by which plants grow towards light.  The protein responsible is called PHOT and contains two protein domains called LOV (Light-Oxygen-Voltage) domains.  The team will investigate the biochemical steps by which PHOT transmits the signal that initiates phototropism following activation by light.  The mechanism appears to involve formation of interacting pairs (dimers) of LOV domains.  The interaction of LOV domains will be studied by a range of techniques, including detection of single dimers by fluorescence spectroscopy.  \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of the proposal range from the training of graduate and undergraduate students to a fundamental understanding of signaling in LOV domains, which belong to a broad class of proteins involved in signaling, not only in plants but in the other biological kingdoms as well.  Participants in the project will include undergraduate students in the UKanTeach program at the University of Kansas, which trains science majors at KU for high school science teaching.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlants can respond to blue light because they contain proteins such as phototropin (PHOT) that incorporate Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) sensing domains.  LOV domains, which are widespread in plants, algae, fungi and bacteria, contain a cofactor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) that triggers a photochemical response to blue light in PHOT.  The objective of this project was to probe the mechanism by which the initial photochemical response is propagated in the protein.  We studied the LOV1 domain of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr) and LOV domains from the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Rsp). \n\nOur approach was based on fluorescence spectroscopy (see schematic in Figure 1).  It was thought that LOV1 domains form dimers (two LOV1 proteins adhering to each other).  Proteins were labeled by attaching dyes that emit either green or red fluorescence.  Blue light excitation to form dimers would yield \"mixed\" dimers having one green and one red fluorescing dye, as well as green-green and green-red dimers.  Mixed green-red dimers can be detected by fluorescence methods such as F&oslash;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). \n\nFor Cr LOV1 we found that, contrary to previous reports, dimers do not form between native LOV1 domains, even after blue light excitation.  Our collaborators at the University of Regensburg corroborated this observation in their own experiments.  However, dimers were detected in LOV1 domains with intact histidine tags, chains of six to ten histidine units at the N-terminus of the protein that were used to purify expressed protein.  These non-native LOV1 interactions were regulated by blue light excitation.  We can conclude, first, that Cr LOV1 does not appear to be a site for dimer formation in full-length phototropin.  The mechanism of signal propagation lies elsewhere.  Second, however, for LOV1 domains with intact histidine tags, interactions between LOV1 domains to form dimers can be controlled by blue light.  In fact, we showed that the interactions between single LOV1 domains and nickel ions located at a surface were modulated by blue light.   \n\nHaving shown the absence of native dimer formation for Cr LOV1, we explored the effect of blue light on Rsp LOV domains.  In contrast to Cr LOV1, Rsp LOV domains are known to form dimers in the dark that dissociate into monomers in the light.  The re-formation of dimers in the light can be detected by fluorescence by a method similar to that used for Cr LOV1, as shown in Figure 2.  Formation of these dimers was detected by several fluorescence methods in our work:  single-molecule burst measurements, photon counting histograms, and fluorescence anisotropy decay.  The latter were \"label-free\"&mdash;that is they did not require attachment of a fluorescent dye.  To highlight one of these methods, we showed that analysis of photon counting histograms to determine the relative brightnesses and relative populations of diffusing molecules, are a highly sensitive method for detecting protein-protein interactions. \n\nThe project has broader impacts.  First, the results are important for the fields of flavoproteins and photoactivated proteins.  Second, given the importance of protein-protein interactions in cellular signaling, the methods of detecting protein-protein interactions will be applicable to a wide range of proteins.  Third, a number of undergraduate and graduate students were trained in this project.  Fluorescence methods are increasingly important in biophysics, cellular imaging, and materials research.  Several of the undergraduate students plan graduate work in chemistry or biophysics.  Two undergraduate participants were part of the UKanTeach program at the University of Kansas.  This program prepares science majors for K-12 education, resulting in the licensure for teaching. Some undergraduates have gone into medicine or business.  Similarly, graduate students received in-depth training in multidisciplinary research, including fluorescence methods and data analysis.  All participants gained experience in international, interdisciplinary research. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carey K Johnson"
