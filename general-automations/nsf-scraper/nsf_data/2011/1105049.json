 "awd_abstract_narration": "Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are potentially significant but of unknown importance as a source of aqueous-phase secondary organic aerosol (SOA). GLVs are reactive, oxygenated, organic compounds that are emitted from plants in significant quantities and that can react both at the surface of fog drops and within the bulk of the drops. These aqueous reactions can occur via photochemically generated oxidants such as hydroxyl radical, singlet molecular oxygen, and excited triplet states of organic compounds. GLVs are also oxidized in the gas phase to make more water soluble products that could also participate in fog-drop reactions to form SOA. The hypothesis driving this research is that the uptake and photooxidation of GLVs and their first generation oxidation products can be a significant source of secondary organic carbon in fogwater. This hypothesis will be tested through four objectives: (1) Collect and chemically characterize fogwaters from Louisiana and California. (2) Measure GLV photooxidation, changes in organic composition, and the formation of SOA in illuminated fogwaters. (3) Quantify photooxidants  in the illuminated fog waters and their reactivity with GLVs. (4) Integrate results from each objective in order to determine the mechanisms for GLV reactions in fogwaters and assess the significance of GLVs as an aqueous source of SOA.\r\n\r\nA post-doctoral scholar, a graduate student, and undergraduate students will be mentored during the project, including through an LSU-UCD undergraduate exchange research program. The results from the research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate teaching at both institutions. And, because fog events can affect the concentrations of regulated pollutants, especially PM2.5, in both Louisiana and California, results from this work will inform state air quality policy agencies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGreen-leaf volatiles (GLVs) are oxygenated, unsaturated hydrocarbons that are emitted from vegetation under stress.  GLVs are a subset of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), the gases emitted by vegetation that dominate global emissions of reactive hydrocarbons to the atmosphere.  Because they are oxygenated, GLVs can partition into fog and cloud drops, where they react with aqueous oxidants &ndash; including hydroxyl radical (OH), singlet molecular oxygen (1O2*) and excited triplet states of organic sensitizers (3C*).  If the products from these reactions are sufficiently low volatility, they will stay in the particle phase after the cloud or fog drop evaporates, representing a possible aqueous-phase source of secondary organic aerosol (SOA).  SOA is important because it is an abundant portion of the atmospheric particle population, which affects climate and human health.  While the aqueous oxidation of GLVs to form SOA might be significant, there was insufficient information to assess this pathway prior to our project.\n\nThis project was a collaboration with the research group of K. T. Valsaraj at Louisiana State University.  Our portion of the work had four main goals: (1) quantify the concentrations of the three major oxidants - OH, 1O2*, and 3C* - in illuminated fog waters from California and Louisiana, (2) measure the rate constants for each of these oxidants with five GLVs, (3) determine the SOA yields from the GLV oxidation reactions, and (4) integrate our results with those from LSU to examine the mechanisms for aqueous GLV oxidation and assess the significance of these reactions as sources of SOA.\n\nOur measurements from the first goal showed that fogwater oxidant concentrations at the two sites were similar, with OH and 1O2* levels similar to those previously reported at Davis.  The novel component was the measurement of 3C*, which is the first time this oxidant was quantified in atmospheric waters.  We found that triplet concentrations are high enough that this oxidant should be an important, and previously unrecognized, sink for several classes of compounds, including phenols and a number of pesticides.  In our second goal we determined rate constants for the three oxidants with the five GLVs.  We found that the GLVs react very rapidly with OH but only slowly with 1O2*.  The most surprising result was that triplet states react very rapidly with some of the GLVs, apparently because the molecules are unsaturated.  To follow up on this discovery, we measured rate constants for a suite of 16 unsaturated BVOCs and similar compounds: the resulting reactivities ranged from modest to very fast, indicating that triplets might play a previously unappreciated role in the oxidation of unsaturated organics in cloud/fog drops and water-containing aerosol particles.  In addressing our third goal we found that reactions of the GLVs with OH and 3C* typically form SOA relatively efficiently: SOA yields ranged from 10 to 80% and were similar for the two oxidants with a given GLV.  For our last goal we used our newly determined oxidant concentrations, rate constants, and SOA yields to assess the significance of aqueous GLV reactions as a source of SOA in a fog.  We found that aqueous reactions dominate the processing of the most soluble GLV (methyl jasmonate) but that gas-phase reactions dominate for the other four species.  Overall, the rate of aqueous SOA formation from methyl jasmonate is modest but could be significant in regions with very high GLV concentrations.  Overall, our results suggest that aqueous and gaseous reactions of GLVs are a minor source of SOA under typical conditions. \n\nThe most significant finding from our portion of this collaborative work concerned the excited triplet states.  We found that 3C* concentrations are fairly high in illuminated fog waters (approximately 100 times higher than OH) and that these oxidants react rapidly with a number of aqueous unsaturated BVOCs.  This suggests that triplets are a significant, but previously unappreciated, aqueous sink for a number of important unsaturated organics.  This group likely includes the first-generation products from some of the most abundant BVOCs in the atmosphere, such as isoprene and terpenes. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cort Anastasio"
