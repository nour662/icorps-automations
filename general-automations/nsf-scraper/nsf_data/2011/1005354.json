 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this research are to improve the initialization of convective storms in high-resolution (1 ~ 4 km) numerical models by assimilating dual-polarimetric Doppler (\"dual-pol\") radar observations, and likewise to improve understanding of the evolution of convective storms using numerical models and data assimilation. The objectives of this research include:\r\n1)\tto develop a Doppler radar data assimilation methodology for ice-phase microphysical processes included in the \"radar forward model\", and to understand the general role of microphysics processes in convective storms and the storm related precipitation, using actual (i.e. as observed by ARMOR) case studies;\r\n2)\tto understand the information content of dual-polarimetric radar observations and their relationship to model physics uncertainty;\r\n3)\tto develop a technique to assimilate observations uniquely from the dual-polarimetric Doppler radar, investigate effective strategies for performing radar data assimilation, and evaluate the impacts of each dual-polarimetric variable in the model's [the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model] initial condition and numerical prediction.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits\r\nThe research activities will improve skill in Doppler radar data assimilation with ice-phase forward model, a better understanding of uncertainty in model microphysical parameters and dual-polarimetric radar observations, and subsequently significant advances in dual-polarimetric Doppler radar data assimilation techniques.  The research will take advantage of the availability of the ground-based C-band Advanced Radar for Meteorological and Operational Research (ARMOR) dual-polarimetric Doppler observations, as well as the unique suite of in-situ and remote sensing observational instruments currently operating in the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAHuntsville)/National Space Science and Technology center (NSSTC; in particular, an X-band mobile Doppler radar).  Dual-polarimetric measurements collected by the ARMOR radar will be assimilated into the WRF with ice-phase microphysical processes embedded into the data assimilation package.  These data will also be used to examine and constrain the uncertainties in the WRF model's microphysical parameterization. Observations from the NSSTC instruments, high-resolution numerical simulations, and data assimilation results for select case events of convective storms will be used to conduct the aforementioned research activities. This research will be one of the first of its kind using dual-polarimetric Doppler radar observations with the WRF model and the 3DVAR data assimilation system for real case studies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe research has the potential to improve operational forecasts of convective weather.  In particular, the researchers will contribute to improving understanding of the evolution of convective storms and how to enhance short-term forecasts of convective precipitation via the assimilation of Doppler radar observations.  The data assimilation techniques developed herein will be readily transferable to other research institutes, as well as the operational community, for improvements in the current prediction of convective storms. Given the upgrade of the WSR-88D radar network that is currently underway, research on the assimilation of dual-polarimetric radar data needs to move to the forefront so that new insights on the optimal methods for utilizing these data may be developed.  The new findings will be communicated through conference presentations, peer-reviewed journal articles, and in educational materials for enhancing course curriculum. Collaboration with other university scientists and graduate students will further extend this research to the larger academic and educational community.",
