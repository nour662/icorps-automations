 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is establishing a two semester certificate program in stem-cell technologies targeted at post-baccalaureates and individuals who have completed, or are nearing completion of, the associate degree biotechnology program. It responds to the needs of local industry.  Materials developed for this program will help the college integrate relevant stem cell techniques into an existing Associate of Applied Science degree program.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Stem cell research is a rapidly emerging field and has become an integral component of many emerging biotechnology companies.  This project offers the opportunity to develop and test materials and approaches needed to produce capable well-educated stem cell technicians.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Materials developed will become available through Bio-Link, a National Center of Excellence in Biotechnology.  A faculty-enhancement workshop and national educator's conference will further extend the impact of this project to the high school students, college students, and professionals served by those educators.  Outreach efforts to institutions in the area serving students currently underrepresented in the biotechnology field, and in STEM generally, are also part of the broader impacts of this project.",
