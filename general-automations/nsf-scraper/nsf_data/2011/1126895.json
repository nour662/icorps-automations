 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Michael Carrasco from Santa Clara University and colleague Amelia Fuller will acquire an electrospray inonization tandem (ESI-MS/MS) mass spectrometric system. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) identification of foldamers that mimic proteins, (b) chemoselective glycosylation of peptides that protection from proteolysis, (c) synthesis of glycolipopeptides, (d) aptamer selection for glycopeptides and glycoproteins, (e) characterization of release of biogenic amines from the pericardial organs of cancer borealis, (f) characterization of interactions between proteins and silver nanoparticles, and (g) identification of the ligand-binding properties of porphyrin assemblies.\r\n\r\nMass spectrometers (MS) are used to identify the chemical composition of a sample by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer. This instrument couples a high-resolution liquid chromatography system with the mass analysis ability of mass spectrometry. A liquid chromatograph located at the mouth of the spectrometer separates mixtures into their molecular components. These components then flow into the mass spectrometer where they are ionized using an electrospay source. The tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS) involves multiple steps with some form of fragmentation occurring between stages. In this way their masses, and those of their fragments, are measured. The instrumentation will be used not only for research but also in laboratory courses to train significant numbers of students in the use of this important analytical technique.",
