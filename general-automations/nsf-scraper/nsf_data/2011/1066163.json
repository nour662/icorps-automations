SONG is an existing international collaboration that will build and use a global network of eight one-meter sized telescopes distributed all over the world with two main science goals of studying the internal structure of stars in unprecedented detail, and searching for Earth-sized exoplanets in habitable zones.  The main purpose of this conference is to address development of the U.S. contribution to the project.",

Learning about stellar interior structures will help us to better understand the how stars change as they age and how the Milky Way galaxy is structured and how it has changed as it has aged. Identifying extrasolar planets will help us to better estimate the chances of finding life elsewhere. These ambitious goals can be met from ground-based telescopes without the need of orbital satellites such as NASA&rsquo;s Kepler mission. Instead, the consortium needs only to build a whole-Earth telescope composed of several one-meter aperture telescopes widely dispersed in longitude. This telescope is designed to continuously monitor selected bright stars for periods of up to six months at a time.

One or two U.S. nodes are needed to complete the network. In order to unite U.S. interest and support for the SONG project, the College of Charleston hosted the Fourth SONG Workshop in Charleston, South Carolina, in September 2011. The workshop brought together scientists from a number of U.S. astronomical institutions, along with their international counterparts. The workshop addressed the status of the existing telescope construction, SONG science, the interactions between SONG and other observatories, the plan for U.S. SONG nodes, and a Chinese proposal for a mini-SONG telescope network.
