 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to bring together representatives of the different sectors (industry, science, regulators, and environmentalists) in a workshop that will address the environmental and social effects of hydraulic fracturing and gas drilling. An interdisciplinary workshop at Duke University is proposed to capture different environmental and social aspects and the scientific, legal, and socio-economic components related to gas extraction. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will address key environmental and social issues related to hydraulic fracturing, including 1) the water-energy nexus (how much water is needed and where water availability could limit hydraulic fracturing), 2) disposal (what are the scientific factors that limit the disposal of toxic and radioactive produced water to the environment), 3) direct environmental impacts (how the different environmental effects could be avoided, mitigated, and regulated), and 4) socio-economic effects (how will the expansion of natural gas exploration via hydraulic fracturing influence U.S. energy security and affect other potential options for energy diversification, including renewable forms of energy, and what will be the socio-economic impacts on the communities in the surrounding areas of gas production?)\r\n\r\nGiven the magnitude of hydraulic fracturing and gas drilling in the U.S., significant public interest is expected from this proposed workshop. Outcomes from this workshop will include publications of the presentations in the workshop in both professional journals and the public. The dissemination of this interdisciplinary dialogue will be also published on a web site designed specifically for the proposed workshop. Finally, the results of the workshop should help engage stakeholders and policymakers in discussions about the results and context for the conclusions reached at the meeting, including holding at least one information session or briefing in Washington, D.C.",
