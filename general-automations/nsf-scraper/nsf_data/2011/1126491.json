 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's request funding for an integrated precision-depth multibeam / current-profiling / bottom characterization (MCC) system to be used in lake-studies research and research training (both research based lab classes and faculty-mentored student research) at Middlebury College and within the Lake Champlain basin of Vermont and New York. The MCC system will address a lack of detailed bottom bathymetry, surface sediment characterization, and observations of circulation. Existing data are quite old, of questionable accuracy, limited in scope, and not up to current technological standards. To move interdisciplinary research objectives in the Lake Champlain basin forward over the next 20 years, these issues must be addressed. The MCC system requested will provide these data.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe PI's and overall teams record and dedication to student training and educational programs is very strong. An outstanding aspect of the proposal and the lake studies program at Middlebury College are their openness for students of other institutions to experience the limnological disciplines and instrumentation. The diversity of disciplinary areas served by the instrumentation is high and also a strength of the proposal. The partnering institutions within the region also suggest strong opportunity for broad interdisciplinary and extended opportunities for students and training functions. There are clear applied uses of datasets collected for both scientific and societal concerns within the Champlain system spanning from water quality, habitat and sediment/nutrient/contaminant dispersal and transport. Multibeam capabilities will undoubtedly be a strong attraction for expanding cooperative research initiatives and partnerships in the region.",
