Co-chaired by Vicki Grassian of the University of Iowa and Robert Hamers of the University of Wisconsin, the workshop will be held in Arlington, VA on June 28-29, 2011. The workshop will engage a diverse group of established investigators from academia, US government laboratories, and leading international laboratories who work to elucidate the interactions between anthropogenic nanomaterials and the environment. The objective of the workshop is to discuss and summarize the challenges and opportunities for chemists and material scientists in this area of research in a workshop report that will be broadly disseminated to the chemistry and materials science community.",
