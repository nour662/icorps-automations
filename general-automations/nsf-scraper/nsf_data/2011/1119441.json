 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Atlantis, a 274? general purpose Global vessel; the R/V Knorr, a 279?general purpose Global vessel; and the R/V Oceanus, a 177?, general purpose, Intermediate vessel. All three vessels are operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The request includes three items listed by priority:\r\n\t1) Oxygen Titrators\r\n\t2) SBE 9+ CTD\r\n\t3) Laboratory plugmolds and GFI circuits\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\tThe principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",
