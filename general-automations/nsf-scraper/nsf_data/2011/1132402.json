Our conference has started as an annual undergraduate student conference 2005 and expanded to include graduate researchers since 2009.  The conference has now established a tradition of attracting active student researchers and their faculty mentors from the North Carolina and Virginia. With the support of NSF, we hope to attract diverse group of participants from the whole Southeastern Atlantic region.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity for personal interaction among students and between students and faculty is a hallmark of our conference.  These interactions enhance the research infrastructure and are essential for the success of (student) research and for training a new generation of mathematicians and statisticians. Moreover, women and minorities currently underrepresented in mathematical research are especially encouraged to participate in the conference and in the past students from these underrepresented groups accounted for about half of the supported participants.",
