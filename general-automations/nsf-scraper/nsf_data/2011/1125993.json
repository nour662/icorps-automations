 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Stephanie Sen from The College of New Jersey and colleagues Lynn Bradley, David Hunt, Danielle Guarracino and Abby O'Connor will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) alkene hydrogenation by (allyl)Ni(II) complexes containing stabilizing pendant coordinating arms, (b) probing hormone-protein interactions implicated in disease, (c) development of small molecule proteasome inhibitors, (d) studies of insect juvenile hormone metabolism, (e) synthetic methods for ring construction, and (f) use of cocrystals as active pharmaceutical ingredients.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research not only at The College of New Jersey but also will support nearby institutions such as Rider University and also industrial collaborations.",
