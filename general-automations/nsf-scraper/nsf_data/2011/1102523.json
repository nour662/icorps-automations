 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colorado State University (CSU), the lead institution, in collaboration with fourteen institutional\r\npartners constitutes the CO-AMP consortium. The Consortium is proposing a strategic and\r\ncomprehensive effort to address the following goals in connection with underrepresented minorities,\r\nwomen of color, and persons with disabilities successfully completing baccalaureate degrees in Science,\r\nTechnology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM):\r\n1) Continue to increase bachelor degree completion in STEM disciplines;\r\n2) Improve retention and transfer rates from 2-year to 4-year institutions;\r\n3) Enhance partnerships with Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) in Colorado;\r\n4) Strengthen graduate school preparation;\r\n5) Promote international research experiences to enhance global diversity and understanding.\r\nSince its inception, efforts of the CO-AMP Consortium have extended from the pre-freshmen\r\nlevel to enrollment in graduate school programs. The Consortium has been a major driving force at\r\npartner institutions to encourage and motivate students to excel and graduate with a bachelor?s. degree in\r\nSTEM fields. The enrollment and visibility of diverse students has also increased, demonstrated by the\r\nrecent 84% increase in LS CO-AMP enrollment. A significant level of support, in addition to that from\r\nthe NSF, has been provided by central administrations, Departments and Colleges of the Consortium,\r\nand industry partners. Most importantly, the Consortium faculty and staff have provided individualized\r\nstudent support without which the activities would not have been as successful.\r\nMost, if not all, of the proposed initiatives in goals 1 through 5 have been and will continue to be\r\ninstitutionalized at partner institutions. Early integration of minority students into college life must start in\r\nthe admissions office with early faculty advising and mentoring linked to the process. Proposed math skill\r\nbuilding and science course assistance will be continued and further expanded. Student academic\r\nadvancement will also be enhanced by participation in NAPIRE and other international research\r\nexperiences, contributing to global diversity and understanding. In addition, further establishment of\r\nprofessional societies at 2-year and 4-year colleges is critical to increasing science identity and\r\nintegration into the professional community. This collaboration of national resources, resulting from these\r\ndiverse programs, is essential to assure benefits to underrepresented minorities, women of color, and\r\nperson with disabilities; and will be sustained as an essential structure continuing after funding from the\r\nNSF is no longer available.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nInnovative programs based on the Tinto Model and research results from the Higher Education\r\nResearch Institute (HERI) will target improved academic and social integration of students into college life\r\nand promote students? self-identity as scientists. CO-AMP will integrate math assistance and curricula\r\nbetween 2-year and 4-year institutions. Pipelines between high school, 2-year/4-year colleges, and\r\ngraduate school will be integrated by faculty mentoring into the admissions process, establishing\r\nprofessional societies on campuses, and building bridges through innovative summer workshops,\r\nresearch at 2-year and 4-year campuses, and international research experiences. Evaluation efforts will\r\nprovide evidence-based methodologies for improving student retention. CO-AMP has a history of qualified staff, as well as the facilities, networks, and partnerships in place to focus on\r\nbuilding a stronger infrastructure that will continue to build capacity and compatibility in the Consortium.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe programs and activities CO-AMP will undertake cover the core areas of recruitment and\r\nretention, including training of faculty, promotion of proven programs, support from industry involvement,\r\nas well as conducting research to determine best practice in preparing students for higher levels of math\r\nand science. CO-AMP is partnered with all of the Hispanic Serving Institutions in Colorado and Fort\r\nLewis (one of only three Native American-Serving Non-Tribal Colleges in the US) making it optimally\r\npositioned to serve the greatest number of Hispanic and Native American students. Results of research\r\nconducted will be presented at conferences and published to further knowledge in this important area of\r\ndiversity education. The results will reduce educational disparities and improve scientific knowledge in\r\nminority/tribal communities, as trained minority scientists act as role models and educators.",
