This planning visit will result in apple snail investigators from the United States, Uruguay and Brazil meeting together, sharing recent research developments, brainstorming complementary research questions and writing a full IRES proposal that incorporates undergraduates into their program.  The team blends expertise from museums (Natural History Museum of Montevideo, Smithsonian Institute), research universities (University of Hawaii, Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz in Brazil) and an undergraduate institution (Southwestern University) to create diverse student research experiences focused on three sub-disciplines of biology: namely phylogenetics, biography and ecology.  The research topics include quantifying genetic variation in this understudied group, identifying patterns of speciation, determining reproductive potential and then hypothesizing about range expansion implications.\r\n\r\nThe visit will involve one early-career researcher and two students.  It has the potential to generate a larger international program, which will allow students to gain experience in multiple collection and archiving techniques for apple snails while forging international partnerships with Uruguayan and Brazilian investigators.",

PI Burks additionally traveled to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to visit Instituto Oswaldo Cruz and Thiengo\u00c6s laborator and visited language programs in both cities. \n\nGRANT OUTCOMES: Logistically, the planning grant made assembly of a full proposal substantially easier.  We submitted a full IRES proposal in February of 2011. If the proposal receives funding, then six US students would travel to Brazil and Uruguay starting at the end of this November, 2011.\n\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT: \"AMPLIFIED\" refers to the family Ampullariidae, commonly known as apple snails.  Apple snails possess unique anatomical, physiological and behavioral adaptations for using ephemeral habitats and provide a useful model for illustrating evolutionary adaptations for the transition from a fully-aquatic to a semi-terrestrial existence. Ampullariids embody many characteristics sought in a model organism, including the ability to establish cultures, a quick reproductive cycle, easily accessible life history stages and a wide tropical and subtropical distribution.  Several apple snail species have also become invasive globally and can carry parasites, which makes reasons for understanding their biology particularly tangible to undergraduate researchers.  In terms of host countries, Brazil harbors the greatest number of ampullariid species and genera and provides the largest latitudinal span (~37&ordm;) of any country in South America, thereby facilitating diverse comparative study within and among species and genera. The word \"Uruguay\" comes from Guaran&iacute;, the language spoken by the natives who inhabited the basin of the Rio de la Plata, and translates to \"river of the snails.\" With our conceptual framework, diverse projects are possible and eminently feasible.\n\n BROADER IMPACTS: AMPLIFIED outcomes include discovery of new species, large-scale revision of ampullariid systematics, new information on basic ecology of understudied species and materials for educational outreach in Uruguay, Brazil and the United States.  We will train 15 undergraduate students, several from underrepresented groups, to think of themselves as global scientists.  As intended by the IRES program, the students will not only gain research experience but also networking skills, language development, international cultural awareness, and a strong personal incentive to consider international research opportunities in their future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/22/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Romi L Burks"
