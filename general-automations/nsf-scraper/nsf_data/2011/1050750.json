 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  Jumbo phages are very large viruses capable of infecting bacteria. There are many different kinds and they are easy to find, isolate, and grow and play important roles in global ecosystems. This project concerns the relationship between the structures of the protein shells (capsids) of viruses and the sizes of the viral DNAs (genomes) packaged inside them, as well as the evolutionary pathways that lead to viruses of increasing size. Very few structures of jumbo viruses have been determined to date and very little is known about the evolutionary processes that produce their elaborate architectures. Important questions about the evolution of jumbo viruses will be tackled comprehensively by combining cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), to investigate the details of capsid architecture, with biochemistry and molecular genetics, to establish their protein and DNA compositions. One hypothesis that will be tested posits that individual mutations in the major capsid protein modify the self-assembly of capsid monomers so as to increase the size of the assembled capsid, allowing additional, superfluous DNA sequences to be packaged, for example, extra copies of some genes. Over time, these unneeded gene copies may be gradually replaced with useful and eventually essential gene sequences, thus locking in the new capsid structure. The studies of virus structural evolution are enabled, on the one hand, by significant improvements in cryoEM technology, and on the other, by advances in sequencing genomic DNA. The two researchers leading this project are experts in these technologies and will work together to address questions not accessible by either approach alone.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project aims at revealing evolutionary connections between the virus capsid and genome by studying structural relationships among very large capsids of different bacterial viruses. In a broader sense, the project will illuminate a regime of macro-molecular complexity that is significantly under-investigated. Bacterial viruses are important model systems for understanding protein structure, self-assembly, and function and are important sources of biotechnology tools (for example, viral promoters, phage display libraries). Structure determination of viral components continues to contribute significantly to the understanding of virus biology and the interactions between host cells and viruses. A complete structural description of the viral subunits, their binding sites and accessible surfaces, will allow exploration of new anti-viral molecules that will be useful medically, in fermentation-based industries, agriculture and in biotechnology including bacterial use for cleaning oil-spills and for generating renewable energy. Education and Outreach opportunities come from the synergy between the two collaborating disciplines and the anticipated impact on undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows from the two participating departments, Structural Biology and Biological Sciences. Five students will be recruited each year for this unique training opportunity that includes screening for exceptionally large virions, performing biochemical analyses, and processing cryo-electron microscopy images to visualize capsid structures in three dimensions. Undergraduate recruiting will follow the successful model of the existing \"Phage Hunters\" program, recruiting from undergraduate classes and through campus chapters of minority-oriented professional organizations (POMS, NSBE). Graduate students involved in the project will gain teaching experience by mentoring undergraduates.",

Few structures for large virus capsids have been reported, and the processes that drive capsid assembly and which lead to such elaborate architectures targeted here are so poorly investigated as to be not understood at all. We used cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) to investigate capsid architecture, and biochemistry and molecular genetics to study corresponding protein and DNA compositions. The virus family that we targeted includes double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) tailed bacteriophages (viruses infecting bacteria) that exploit the bacteriophage HK97 capsid protein fold, a family that is predicted to account for 90-95% of viruses on the planet and which includes the herpesviruses. Our focus is on very large capsids that package at least 200,000 base pairs of dsDNA, and we call these the &ldquo;jumbophages&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Finding large bacteriophages (phages) required developing special methods of growth and purification, which is why they have not been readily identified in the past. With these methods we could isolate, grow and purify jumbophages from water and soil samples. Our initial focus was on six jumbophages that had large capsids of different sizes. Five of these have icosahedral symmetry (20 triangular facets) and one was a prolate (extended) icosahedron. DNA content ranged from 203,000 to 640,000 base pairs of DNA, and capsid diameters from 120-180 nm. We imaged phage samples by cryoEM for determining structures of the capsids to resolutions where the protein folds can be visualized. We observed that all six capsids were constructed primarily&nbsp;from many copies of a single capsid protein, and that all six of these proteins adopted the same fold (shape) as the bacteriophage HK97 capsid protein. This is convincing evidence that the viruses all derived from a common ancestor that is likely deeply remote in time. Smaller members of this fold family are already known to be related to the herpesvirus family and to some viruses of archaea, suggesting that the lineage reaches back to before cells split into the three Domains of bacteria, eukarya and archaea.</p>\n<p>The question arises about how this common protein fold is able to be used by viruses of very different sizes and complexity. Another finding that bears on this question is that all six jumbophages package DNA by a &ldquo;head-full&rdquo; mechanism &ndash; ie, a motor forces viral DNA into the preformed capsid until it is full, presumably signaled by some pressure sensing mechanism, and then cuts the DNA and closes the entry port. Evidence for this packaging mechanism comes from sequencing the genomes to establish their lengths, and that all the capsids contain more than one unique genome of DNA, from 5% to 20% extra. This latter measurement was complicated for several of our jumbophages that had chemically modified DNA, and we had to develop a new measuring method to account for this. However, with accurate results in hand, we propose a ratchet-like model for increasing capsid and genome sizes whereby a mutation in the capsid protein results in larger capsids into which more DNA is packaged. Such mutations in the major capsid protein that modify capsid size have been observed in several smaller phages.
