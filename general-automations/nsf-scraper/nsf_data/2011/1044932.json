The project assesses the applicability of high-level languages and creates both classroom and laboratory materials to teach these languages in an undergraduate setting. \r\n\r\nThe project has a potential to transform undergraduate computer science education of the next generation of parallel programmers and multicore developers. The project contributes resources to the NSDL library to encourage other educators to integrate parallel programming and higher-level languages into the undergraduate curriculum at their institutions.",
