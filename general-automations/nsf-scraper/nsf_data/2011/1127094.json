 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the recent banking crisis in the United States has reminded us, effective supervision is an important instrument for avoiding crises and promoting financial stability. While there was a large and complex supervisory network in place, the banking and financial agencies failed to detect and prevent excessive risk-taking and even illegal activities. Although the Frank-Dodd Reform made some important changes to the supervisory structure, it is generally agreed that it did not attempted an overall reform of the system. Any such reform requires a thorough understanding of the development and issues underlying the system of supervision.\r\n\r\nWhile there is a vast scholarly literature on the history of the Federal Reserve and the operation of monetary policy, there is no general history of bank supervision in the United States. This project addresses this critical gap by collecting a comprehensive data base on all aspects of the multiple federal bank regulatory agencies from 1863 to 2008.\r\nPart of the difficulty in collecting such data mirrors the difficulty that Congress experienced in managing oversight of the supervisory system. Each agency has a different structure, mission and funding. Combined with considerable independence, the result has been a lack of transparency and regulatory failure. This new data base will provide economists, political scientists and other researchers with key information to assess the development, operation and effectiveness of the American supervisory system.\r\n\r\nThe analytical part of this project is framed by five distinctive supervisory regimes that reflect five different approaches to bank supervision, yielding a natural experiment in how to manage risk-taking by financial intermediaries. The objective of this study is to examine how the incentives created by the regulatory and supervisory systems yielded specific trade-offs between efficiency and growth on the one hand and safe and sound institutions on the other.\r\n\r\nBy providing the first comprehensive statistical study of bank supervision in the United States, this project will yield some of the necessary information for theoretical and empirical economic analyses that will be needed as guidance for future reform.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhile there is a vast scholarly literature on the history of the Federal Reserve and the operation of monetary policy, there is no general history of U.S. bank supervision.   This project partially addresses this critical gap by collecting data on many aspects of the multiple federal bank regulatory agencies from 1863 to 2008.   Part of the difficulty in collecting such data mirrors the difficulty that Congress experienced in managing oversight of the supervisory system.  Each agency has a different structure, mission and funding. Combined with considerable independence, the result has been a lack of transparency and regulatory failure.  \n\nThis project has focused its collection of data on three aspects of bank supervision: (1) Bank examinations: Since the early nineteenth century, federal and state agencies have regularly inspected banks, examining their books that are otherwise closed to outsiders because of the proprietary and sensitive nature of the information.  The Comptroller of the Currency has deposited its examinations of national banks for the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in the National Archives.   This project photographed the examinations for New York City banks from 1887 to 1908, totaling approximately 10,000 photographs.  A team of research assistants began the task of coding this data; and the initial analyses reveal in precise detail how bank examiners contributed to the safety and soundness of the banking system.  (2) Directors Minutes of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks:   After the Fed?s creation in 1913, the regional Reserve Banks became involved in supplying liquidity to and supervision of their member national and state-chartered banks.  The record of their actions is preserved in the directors? minutes.   The minutes for the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Cleveland were used to reconstruct policy, with new data on the whole Federal Reserve system, for two research papers on the successful management of banking distress in the severe recession of 1920-1921.  (3) Budgets and Staffing of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation:   The annual reports and other documents from these agencies were used to reconstruct the supervisory capacity&mdash;budgets and human resources---of these agencies from their beginnings to the present.   The collected data from all three aspects of the project will permit econometric tests of the effectiveness of disclosure, examination and disciplinary polices and an evaluation of the trade-off between the provision of credit and losses from bank failures.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/25/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eugene White"
