Up-to-date epidemic analyses incorporate cultural, political, and social factors along side with international travel.  The NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conference \"Mathematical Epidemiology with Applications\" will introduce a new generation of mathematical scientists to this exciting area, while setting in place collaborations and working groups that will generate much more research in the years to come.\r\n\r\nThe conference will feature ten keynote lectures by two leading experts in the field of mathematical epidemiology,  Professor Fred Brauer of the University of British Columbia, and Professor Carlos Castillo-Chavez of Arizona State University.",
