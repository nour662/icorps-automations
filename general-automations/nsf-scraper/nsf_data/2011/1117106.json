 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the increasing popularity of third-party services integrated in hybrid web applications,  come new security challenges posed by the complexity in coordinating these individual services  and the web client. Such complexity often brings in program logic flaws that can be exploited to induce inconsistencies among different services' internal states, causing the security control  within these applications to fail.  A preliminary study of this research investigated the security  implications of the problem to online merchants that accept payments through third-party cashiers  (e.g., PayPal, Amazon Payments and Google Checkout).  It revealed stunning logic loopholes within  leading merchant applications, popular online stores and a prestigious payment service provider,  which can be exploited to purchase an item at an arbitrarily low price, shop for free after  paying for one item, or even completely avoid payment. These findings point to a disturbing lack of  understanding of the logic flaws within the integrations of web services, and an urgent need for significant research efforts on this important problem. \r\n\r\nThis project endeavors to gain an in-depth understanding about the scope and the magnitude of the  security threat posed by the logic flaws in hybrid web applications and the common design pitfalls  that lead to such vulnerability.  Based upon this understanding, it will study novel technologies  to facilitate detection and patching of these flaws when developing merchant software, security  analysis of other parties' applications and black-box testing of merchant websites.  New techniques will also be developed to enable web-service providers to better support secure integrations of their services into merchant systems, and to automatically detect the attempts to exploit these  logic flaws in web transactions. This research involves industry collaborators and will also  contribute to the improvement of security protection in other domains that utilize hybrid web applications.",

In this project, we performed a series of in-depth security analysis of service integrations within conventional browser-based web commerce applications and emerging mobile web apps running on various mobile devices.  Our studies shed new light on the security challenges in service integrations.  On the conventional web platform, our study reveals serious integration flaws within the single-sign-on (SSO) systems provided by PayPal, Facebook, Google and other identity providers, which can be easily exploited by unauthorized parties to log into the victim\u00c6s accounts on popular websites. On mobile platforms, our research reveals the pervasiveness of security flaws in the integration of commercial mobile cloud services within apps (essentially hybrid web applications), particularly the push messaging services provided by Google, Amazon and other cloud service providers and device manufacturers.  Again, the complexity of such service integrations leads to the difficulty in ensuring the security qualities of the applications, causing security controls to fail.  Our further research along the line brought to light serious integration issues between mobile web apps and external devices and between apps and mobile operating systems, pointing to a new challenge in securing service integrations: the lack of serious effort in clarifying what need to be done by different service providers and the app developer to ensure that their individual security controls can be composed into an integrated mechanism that indeed serves the security need of an application. \n\n \n\nThe impacts of our security analyses are significant and far-reaching.  Our work has been extensively reported by mainstream media (e.g., CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, Forbes, etc.).  The seriousness of the security flaws we found has been fully acknowledged by the industry (e.g., PayPal, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc.), causing them to rethink the designs of hybrid web applications for payment, SSO and various mobile services.  Also, our study has inspired the follow-up research on analyzing and protecting those applications, which increasingly arouses the interest in the security community.\n\nTo mitigate those security risks and enhance the security qualities of hybrid web applications, we developed and released a suite of new techniques for different platforms.

We developed a new system, called InteGuard, that automatically identifies the invariants from the traffic generated by a web application\u00c6s service integrations (e.g., payment) and protect them against the attempts to exploit their weaknesses.  We also came up with a series of program analysis tools for automatic detection of security-critical vulnerabilities in the integrations of web services within mobile apps, and other tools for checking the integrations between apps and mobile OS and between apps and external devices.
