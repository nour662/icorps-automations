 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traffic generation plays an integral part of cyber-security defense testing in \r\nnetwork testbeds. Generating just any traffic is easy, but generating realistic traffic \r\nis hard. The key reason for this is that \"realistic\" means different things to different \r\npeople. The definition of realism depends on the use of the traffic in testing, but \r\nall existing traffic generators have a fixed definition of realism that users cannot \r\nchange. \r\n\r\nThis project will build a traffic generator whose definition of realism can be fully \r\nspecified by a user. The generator will consist of three modules: (1) a module that mines values for \r\nuser-specified dimensions from traffic logs, (2) a module that generates random \r\ntraffic that fits the model mined in the previous step, (3) a module that replays \r\ntraffic from a log so that it exactly matches the logged traffic along the user-\r\nspecified dimensions.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The key novelty of this approach lies in the customizable \r\ndefinition of realism that the generator will support. By allowing users to specify \r\ntheir own reality dimensions this project's traffic generation tool will be generic \r\nenough to meet the evaluation needs of any cyber security researcher. Further, \r\nintegration of the traffic generation from models and traffic replay in a single \r\ntool is novel; existing tools support only one of these generation approaches. \r\nFinally, the tool will support traffic generation at application, transport or \r\nnetwork level while existing tools support it only at one select level.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed work will advance cyber-security defense \r\nresearch by supporting rigorous and realistic evaluation of its products. It will do \r\nthat by both fitting researchers' needs and by being extremely portable and \r\neasy to deploy and use. Because users will be able to customize the definition of \r\nrealism as they desire, the evaluation will properly stress the cyber-security \r\ndefenses and its results will be predictive of the defenses performance in real \r\ndeployment. The traffic generator's capabilities to both generate traffic from \r\nlearned models and to replay it from network logs enable a wide range of \r\ntesting strategies and support thorough exploration of problem space. Better \r\nevaluation strategies will lead to better cyber-security defenses.  The project will \r\nintegrate our traffic generator with the DETER testbed for cyber security \r\nexperimentation. All software will also  be released as open-source under the \r\nGNU GPL v3 license.",
