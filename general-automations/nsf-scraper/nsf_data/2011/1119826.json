 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThe Center of Excellence in Materials Research and Innovation* (CEMRI) at the Yale University Center for Research on Innovative Structures and Phenomena (CRISP) discovers and develops novel engineered materials with emphasis on the unique opportunities that arise from designing man-made transition metal oxides at the atomic scale and from structuring amorphous metals down to nanometer dimensions. Two Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs) lead the research effort. The Atomic Scale Design, Control, and Characterization of Oxide Structures IRG investigates the novel chemical, electronic, and magnetic properties that emerge at interfaces between oxides. The research addresses three grand challenges: the design of new oxides with unique physical properties; the creation of new devices based on the novel properties of oxide interfaces; and the understanding and manipulation of the interactions between electrons that give rise to novel properties. The Multi-Scale Surface Engineering with Metallic Glasses IRG focuses on the grand challenge of controlling surface properties of metals by structuring their surface topography over length scales of nanometers to centimeters. This IRG has the unique ability to pattern and shape metallic glasses using methods developed for plastics while retaining the superior properties of metals. Based on this capability, it aims to gain a fundamental understanding of the behavior of metallic glasses as they approach atomic length scales and then to devise hierarchical surface patterns (as often found in nature) to create unique properties. CRISP research impacts a wide range of technologies spanning computation, communication, energy, and medical applications. \r\n\tCRISP research is tightly integrated with an Education and Outreach (EO) program that leverages local EO successes in economically distressed, urban public schools that have a large population of students from underrepresented groups. There are two signature initiatives that evolve based on quantitative assessments. The first focuses on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) recruitment and retention through professional development of teachers in order to impact the largest number of students. The second employs team-based research where the entire spectrum of STEM members (teachers, students, postdocs, and faculty) work together on multi-disciplinary IRG research projects.  \r\n\tCollaborations with industry, national laboratories, and state and local governments play an important role in augmenting CRISP research and EO efforts and providing a pathway for broadening CRISP's impact. Key national laboratory collaborations enable joint development of new characterization methods at national user facilities. Industrial partners provide unique facilities, summer internships, and faculty development grants (e.g., IBM) as well as materials and processing equipment (e.g., PX Group). A partnership with the New Haven Public School system provides teacher assessment data used to develop and assess the impact of CRISP's teacher development initiatives. \r\n\tCRISP houses unique thin film growth and atomic-scale characterization and imaging tools that are not only essential to its success, but also provide a novel contribution to the national network of materials research facilities. The Center welcomes outside users to work with CRISP scientists on new research projects that take advantage of these unique capabilities.\r\n\r\n*An NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC)",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCRISP, a longstanding collaboration between two universities in New Haven - Yale University and Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU), aims to discover and develop novel atomically engineered materials and processes.  Its education and outreach programs work toward recruiting, training, educating, and retaining diverse students, researchers and teachers across all educational levels in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).\n\n\nIntellectual merit (IRG1):  Atomic Scale Design, Control and Characterization of Oxide Structures\n\n\nIRG1 studies novel and unusual material properties that emerge at atomically abrupt semiconductor/oxide and oxide/oxide interfaces.  Such interfaces represent unusual atomic environments that do not exist in the bulk materials, which can result in unique chemistry, bonding and electronic properties, presenting opportunities for novel discoveries.  Theory and experiment collaborate closely to determine the electronic, magnetic, chemical and optical properties at the atomic scale. \nIRG1 researchers' expertise on semiconductor/oxide interfaces led to several exciting developments, allowing one to engineer electronic coupling that can be applied for use in electronics and signal processing.  IRG1 also made significant advances in atomic-scale characterization of oxides using scanning probe microscopy, including a novel, patented high-speed method for non-contact atomic force microscopy with atomic resolution.\n\n\nIntellectual merit (IRG2):  Multi-Scale Surface Engineering with Metallic Glasses\n\n\nIRG2 focuses on fabricating and characterizing metallic glass surfaces and engineering their properties.  To accelerate discovery of new materials, IRG2 researchers developed a combinatorial fabrication process that enables the simultaneous generation of more than 100 different glasses.  These experiments, combined with computational simulations, identified metallic glasses having novel properties.   Studies of the biocompatibility of metallic glasses determined the properties of their surfaces that different cell types can sense.  For example, nanopatterned metallic glasses induce changes in cell morphology and function.  The findings suggest that metallic glasses can be incorporated in a variety of biomedical implants, including biosensors and cardiovascular stents.  \nIn catalysis, IRG2 established that metallic glass alloys can be electrochemically modified into a variety of structures with special catalytic properties.  These advances will enable the fabrication of the next generation of materials for energy applications.\n\n Broader Impacts\n\n\nCRISP's multifaceted materials research program encompasses research, industry and education at Yale, SCSU and beyond.  In the New Haven area, CRISP was instrumental in the expansion of the CRISP nano-characterization facilities at SCSU into the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities Center for Nanotechnology.  CRISP's shared facilities have hosted 300 users annually.  Startup companies were launched by CRISP researchers based on IRG research that commercialized the discoveries.  CRISP also collaborates with Brookhaven National Laboratory in both research and education. Building on close-knit research collaborations, a new Yale course, \"Advanced Synchrotron Techniques and Electron Spectroscopy of Materials,\" was developed in which Brookhaven experts come to Yale to present lectures.  \n\nCRISP's education and outreach programs, which serve as a national model, are built on and integrated with IRG research activities and promote the interdisciplinary and innovative aspects of materials science to diverse groups.  Two unique and high impact programs were developed.  The MRSEC Initiative for Multidisciplinary Education and Research provides students and teachers with cross-disciplinary education and research opportunities, including an opportunity to conduct research in specialized CRISP facilities at Yale and SCSU.  The MRSEC Initiative for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education works to recruit, retain, and increase the number of students in the STEM pipeline while enhancing the scientific literacy of the public, using materials science as a vehicle. Overall, CRISP makes major contributions to materials research, scientific training, and general scientific literacy of the public.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles Ahn"
