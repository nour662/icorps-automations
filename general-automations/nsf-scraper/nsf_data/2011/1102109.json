 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to demonstrate current injection, continues-wave lasing action at room temperature from sub-wavelength-scale disk resonators by developing high-quality modes in the proximity of low-loss conductive media and provide CMOS-compatible buildings blocks based on nanocavities that require current injection and electric field application. The developed nano-resonators will also be used as external nano-modulators. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit is in developing practical, planar nanolasers that is smaller than one wavelength of lasing mode in vacuum. A challenge to build current injection nanolasers arises from the difficulty of suppressing absorption of light by electrode metal. The PI?s approach to build sub-wavelength-scale current-injection nanolasers is to use simple, high-Q disk nanocavity designs with transparent conductive oxide (TCO) electrodes such as indium tin oxide (ITO). The PI?s designs with TCO media have advantages, including large thermal conductance, small electric resistance, and large quantum efficiency via the direct current injection to small lasing modes. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are in inducing the development of on-chip photonics systems, such as optical interconnect chips, lab-on-chip, quantum information chips, imaging devices, and data storage chips, via the development of breakthrough technology in nanolasers. The electrically-controlled light localization technology would break the boundary set by present light localization technology and open up possibilities of creating new light localization devices and enhance the performance and functionality of optical devices. The program will provide excellent outreach opportunities by creating online, hands-on, free scientific curriculums.",
