The ICP-OES will support faculty and student research that will benefit from rapid, high precision and low detection limit analysis of alkaline earth, transition metals and halogen elements in water, soil, minerals, rocks, and plant tissues.\r\nApplications to studies of the biogeochemistry and weathering processes in soils, stream water chemistry and the impacts of road salt in watersheds, beach sediment composition and provenance, the catalytic behavior of transition metal oxides, and phytoremediation of heavy metal impacted soils will be facilitated.  The ICP-OES will support student research training at this non-Ph.D. granting institution and the PIs plan outreach activities with local community colleges.  \r\n\r\n***",
