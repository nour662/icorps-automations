 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Paul Wenthold of Purdue University for the measurement of spin state energies of nitrenes using negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy.  The two main goals of this research are to understand the role of radical stabilizing moieties, such as furanyl and pyridinyl-N-oxide, on the ground and excited state energies, and to study the effect of geometrical constraints on these measurements through the use of angular groups.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the research include the advanced experimental apparatus in the Wenthold laboratory for making measurements of high spin state energies, providing a unique training ground for scientists at all levels.  Gas-phase studies of reactivity and structure can impact all areas of chemistry, as well as other disciplines such as material science and engineering, and aromatic nitrenes have been proposed to have applications in cross-linking experiments, photolithography, as light-sensitive agents in photographic processes and in photoresist technology. The work also has the potential to impact the development of new photoaffinity labels for identifiying the binding sites of proteins involved in biological mechanisms.  The Wenthold laboratory has a strong reputation for training female scientists, and they will launch a new effort with this grant to mentor graduate students with families, whose particular challenges in higher education are often overlooked.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe focus of the previous proposal was on the investigation of the electronic structures of aromatic nitrenes, and, in particular, how to modify the relative energies of the electronic states.  Nitrenes are a fascinating class of electron-deficient and highly reactive intermediates, with electronic structures nominally similar to their carbon analogs, carbenes.  However, unlike carbenes, which undergo facile reactions, including bond-insertion and addition, nitrenes are poor synthetic reagents, forming intractable mixtures of products.  The goal of this work has been to use our knowledge of the mechanisms of electron interactions to modify the electronic structures of aromatic nitrenes to tame their reactivity.  The most significant outcome is the report of aromatic nitrenes with anionic substituents, 1 and 2, with highly stabilized closed-shell singlet states, resulting from quinoidal stabilization.  The electronic structures of 1 and 2 more closely resemble those of the carbenes than of nitrenes.  Our initial efforts involved the formation and characterization of 1 and 2 by using mass spectrometry and gas-phase ion chemistry.  We were able to demonstrate that 1 and 2 have very different electronic structures due to differences in the electron donating ability of the -O- and &ndash;CH2- substituents.\n\n Further characterization of 2 and the meta and para isomers (3 and 4) was carried out by using photoelectron spectroscopy, which shows clearly a triplet ground state for 3 but a singlet ground state for 1 (Figure 1).\n\nOur work with anion-substituted nitrenes highlights the fact that imide anions (R2C=N-) can have nitrene character.  Based on that observation, we have also shown that imide anions can be made to have low-lying triplet states through proper substitution.  Gas-phase studies of p-nitrobenzaldimide anion, 5e, indicate that it has an open-shell electronic structure, consistent with it having a triplet ground state.  Consequently, our work has shown that we can, through use of substitution, make triplet state reagents into singlets, and singlet state anions into triplets, demonstrating control of their electronic structures.   \n\n Current efforts involve attempts to characterize condensed-phase reactivity of 1 &ndash; 3.  Ion 1, in particular, undergoes an unusual photochemical condensation with azidophenoxide to make indophenol (eq 1).  We are also working on developing ions 3 and 5 as potential ligands in organometallic chemistry.\n\n A new area of research for our laboratory initiated with the previous support is in the investigation of canonical structures of biological molecules.  Our approach involves use of a remote charge to serve as a mass spac tag, to allow of the study of gas-phase properties of biological molecules, such as amino acids.    Our initial studies focused on the properties of the dissociation of phenylalanine, using a sulfonated derivative, PheSO3-.   By using ion trap mass spectrometry, we have found that PheSO3- dissociates solely by loss of NH3.  Through the use of control experiments with authentic samples, we deduced the product structure to be an a-lactone, as shown in eq 3.  Perhaps more importantly, we showed that decarboxylation does not occur for the gas-phase amino acid, in contrast to what occurs in solution.\n\n The award has also supported efforts by the PI and the group to create impact beyond that of the physical organic and scientific community.  Our efforts have involved participation in many educational activities, such as the NSF GRFP and outreach to local middle schools through the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Science, and even volunteering at early elementary classrooms.  Another focus of broader impact efforts is in helping parents, in general and also as scientists.  Finally, a significant educational effort has been made to collect and organize freely available on-line content to serve as a resource for introductory organic chemistry students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: ..."
