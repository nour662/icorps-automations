 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project concerns a novel, rapid and cost\r\neffective detection system for fecal contamination in water supplies. Although existing methods can\r\ndetect fecal contamination in water samples, improvements are needed in sensitivity, accuracy, and speed.\r\nThis proposal describes the refinement of a novel sensor utilizing an insect chemosensory protein as the\r\nrecognition element in a product that detects indole, a characteristic metabolite of coliform bacteria. The\r\nbiosensor acts with high specificity and sensitivity, allowing the rapid detection of low level E. coli or\r\nfecal contamination in water supplies, and encompasses a novel implementation of lateral flow\r\ntechnology that can be used at home or in industry.\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are that insect CSP-based biosensors as described constitute a\r\nplatform technology with direct applications in the detection of environmental, chemical, or biological\r\ncompounds or contaminants, including the detection of harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs),\r\nquality control of foods and pharmaceuticals, the detection of toxins or stereoisomers generated during\r\nchemical or pharmaceutical synthesis, and the detection of volatile compounds present in weapons or\r\nexplosives. These biosensors can also be used in medical diagnostics as well as numerous other\r\napplications where high speed, sensitivity and analyte selectivity are required. The platform technology\r\nhas immediate application to a variety of important sensor and detector implementations that affect\r\nnumerous industries, public safety, and public health. The water safety monitor described herein is only\r\none example of the applications possible.",
