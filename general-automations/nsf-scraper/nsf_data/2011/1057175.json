The goal is to find out how to make and to use nanoscale plasma discharges as tools for the highly localized diagnostics and modification of matter. Furthermore this proposed work will increase the exposure of the general public and future graduate student to the exciting and interdisciplinary field of plasma engineering.\r\n\r\nThis proposed research experimentally investigates micro- and nano- scale discharges in liquids. By using nanosecond duration voltage pulses, nanoscale electrodes, and a high density medium such as a liquid, plasma discharges as small as 10s-100s of nanometers in size can be created. Such systems are very complicated with various effects of the plasma generation including: electrophoresis, shock waves, radical species generation, non-equilibrium conditions, light emission, high pressures and high temperatures. The temporal evolution of the thermodynamic state in the small discharges will be measured and manipulated by voltage pulse control to emphasize desired effects for a particular application. Diagnostics will include sub-ns temporal resolution microscopic visualization, optical emission spectroscopy (OES), Schlieren imaging and hydrophones. The experimental results will be correlated with analytical and low-order models comparing the system to existing theories on underwater electrical and laser induced breakdown. These results will be tied into developing course material, and disseminated to students, the general public, and research peers. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The hypothesis of this research is that nanoscale plasma discharges can be created to accentuate various physical, chemical, radiative, or thermal effects by controlling the electrode size, and voltage application. This study of miniscule discharges in high density fluids pushes the limits of current low temperature plasma physics to smaller sizes and higher electron densities. Diagnostic techniques will also be developed in this new regime. Proof of concept tests for some potentially transformative applications will also be explored such as: the chemical analysis of attoliter volumes of liquids; intracellular surgery and diagnostics; maskless nanopatterning; bottom-up nanofabrication; and hydrodynamic flow control. Future potential applications of these unique small size, high energy density, and luminous systems are: nanoscale thermonuclear devices; sub-wavelength visible and UV light sources for near field optical techniques; electro-optical interconnects and, yet unexplored quantum confinement effects in nanoscale plasmas.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The study of such plasma liquid interaction and their applications is important as it is a new regime of plasma physics ripe for new technologies and discoveries. Similarly the nanoscale manipulation of materials and processes is also important. The proposed research focuses on very fundamental aspects, mechanisms and applications with nanoscale plasmas. As a novel system it also has potential for new commercial applications. To enhance educational impacts this proposal will: 1) train and exposure undergraduate, master and doctoral students in the cross disciplinary field of plasma engineering,  2) develop a new undergraduate course on Plasma Engineering including laboratory demonstrations, 3) develop a workshop and seminars on nanoscale plasmas and plasmas in liquids for several international meetings, 4) focus on increasing graduate school participation of domestic students including the underrepresented, and 5) create You-Tube and Wikipedia content to excite and inform the general public about plasmas.",

Toward that end we investigated the use of high voltage (3-20 kV), nanosecond duration electrical pulses at the end of microscale wires and sharpened metal probes (10<sup>-5</sup> m). We examined them under a microscope and with high frame rate (500,000 fps) cameras and short exposure time (10 ns) intensified CCDs. An important consideration in these new types of discharges was understanding if and when a bubble forms and what the properties of the liquid, gas, and plasma are during the discharge. We discovered that for the smallest, lowest energy discharges, a spherical bubble is created and a low temperature plasma exists inside of that bubble. The bubble behavior is predictable by Rayleigh-Plesset models and tells us the plasma is generated at very high pressure. We also discovered that at higher energy an instability occurs where the water appears to crack and the plasma and bubble has a branched, lightning like appearance. We hypothesize that this is occurring because the water surrounding the plasma changes to Ice VII (a high pressure phase of ice) and shatters as the plasma expands. This instability actually prevent us from generating higher energy density plasmas and opens up interesting future paths of research. Focusing on the low energy, low temperature, high pressure plasmas we applied these novel discharges to chemical processing of crude oils. The transient high pressure, and energetic plasma are actually similar conditions to what is inside of an oil refinery. With a kick start from this research, we patented this idea and established a partnership with industry to further develop the applications.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/14/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;A&nbsp;Staack</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1057175/1057175_10100310_1552605155880_plasma-onion--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1057175/1057175_10100310_1552605155880_plasma-onion--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Microplasma &amp; Cells\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1057175/1057175_10100310_1552605155880_plasma-onion--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Microplasma &amp; Cells\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Microplasma generated in water in the vicinity of plant cells</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Peng Xiao</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;A&nbsp;Staack</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Microplasma & Cells</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1057175/1057175_10100310_1552605410179_2018-04-0210.53.57--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1057175/1057175_10100310_1552605410179_2018-04-0210.53.57--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Plasma in Water Branches\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1057175/1057175_10100310_1552605410179_2018-04-0210.53.57--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Plasma in Water Branches\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">1 J plasma discharge in water branches out through micro-cavities in the water.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chris Campbell</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;A&nbsp;Staack</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Plasma in Water Branches</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1057175/1057175_10100310_1552605918910_MicroplasmaInsideOfBubble--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1057175/1057175_10100310_1552605918910_MicroplasmaInsideOfBubble--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Microplasma inside bubbles\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1057175/1057175_10100310_1552605918910_MicroplasmaInsideOfBubble--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Microplasma inside bubbles\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of plasma inside of a spherical microbubble generated during the discharge process.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Peng Xiao</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;A&nbsp;Staack</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Microplasma inside bubbles</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
