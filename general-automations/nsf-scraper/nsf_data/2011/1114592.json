 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this Gordon Research Conference (GRC) is to assess the current state of the art and future challenges in the development and application of quantitative methods for modeling and experimental characterization of the dynamical evolution of metal structures over multiple length and time scales. Invited presentations will cover topics in five main areas: 1. In-situ measurement and modeling approaches for characterizing the evolution of microstructures; 2. Experimental and theoretical investigations of deformation microstructures; 3. The dynamics of phase transformations; 4. Modeling and experimental characterization of irradiation-induced evolution of metal structures; 5. The impact of advances in dynamical modeling and in-situ characterization techniques on the design and optimization of advanced alloy materials for applications ranging from energy generation to transportation. The GRC will be preceded by a Gordon-Kenan Research Seminar (GRS), which will provide a forum for fostering interactions and networking among graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The GRS provides a mechanism for engaging students in the GRC meeting. NSF funds will be used in to assist graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, young faculty and invited speakers in the form of registration waivers and travel support. Attendees generally come from industry, academia and government and have a variety of technical interests. The organizers target the participation of women and underrepresented groups.",
