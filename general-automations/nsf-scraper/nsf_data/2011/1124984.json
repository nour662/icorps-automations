 "awd_abstract_narration": "This International Collaboration in Chemistry between US Investigators and their Counterparts Abroad (ICC) project focuses on developing sophisticated supramolecular assemblies and measurements to advance the state of the art in this area of chemistry and nanoscience.  Highly ordered cyclodextrin monolayers with short tethers are assembled on metal substrates. These assemblies are used for studies using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to understand binding of hydrophobic guest molecules with unprecedented detail. Single (supra)molecular studies enable both electronic and chemical investigations of single-guest binding, as well as direct characterization of multivalent binding and active guest molecule patterning and coupling.  The Weiss group at UCLA is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, with contribution from the Office of International Science and Engineering.  The Huskens group at the University of Twente is supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), the partnering international funding agency.\r\n\r\nThe process of molecular interfacial recognition is central to many important technological and biological processes and phenomena.  This work aims to gain a deeper understanding of molecular interfacial recognition which might be relevant for areas as diverse as solar energy conversion and electronics to sensors and biomedical applications.  In addition, multivalency is known to be a critical component of activity in biological systems, in particular for cell membrane recognition. Cyclodextrin monolayers function as excellent model systems to address multivalency issues at such membranes.  The strong interactive and diverse research environments of this project provides a setting for teaching, training and learning.  The extended visits of students to partner laboratories for collaborative work and training provide students with highly valuable international experience.",
