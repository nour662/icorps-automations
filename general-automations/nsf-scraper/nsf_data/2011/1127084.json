Adaptive strategies to save energy will be built as part of the work. The instrument enables research in/with:\r\n-\tAdvanced instruments and tools that enable researchers to observe physical, chemical, and biological processes and monitor the aquatic environments in real time, across broad physical expanses and durations, continuously and reliably;\r\n-\tNovel hardware and software for the cyber-aquatic system; \r\n-\tTwo types of testbeds: \r\n--\tLake field testbed;\r\n--\tSea field testbed, \r\nwith specific applications using the testbed for: \r\n--- Resolving vertical mixing in the ocean;\r\n--- Identifying/predicting harmful algae; and\t\r\n--- Monitoring distributed offshore oilfield infrastructure.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  \r\nThis project, unique in its goals and expected results, exhibits potential for large broader impacts in the area of sustainable aquatic observation and exploration systems. The instrument will enable a wide range of research activities, from aquatic scientific research (such as oceanography, limnology, and hydrology) and pollution detection, to offshore oil/gas exploration and coastal and harbor/port protection. Planned is a unique hands-on learning environment for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a program engaging K-12 students and teachers, particularly in underserved communities. The PIs have prior track record of involving women, minority, and undergraduate students in their research.",
