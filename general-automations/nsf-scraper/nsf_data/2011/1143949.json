The objectives of the meeting are to:  1)  share the most recent research findings in plant biochemistry, genomics, and genetics between U.S. and Mexican colleagues in order that they may explore common research interests; 2) facilitate collaboration on plant biology research between US and Mexican plant scientists; and 3) ensure that there is broad participation from the US at the conference, by targeting early career, women and minority scientists.  The proposed topics focus on fundamental discoveries that extend our understanding of several aspects of plant biology and address compelling and novel scientific discoveries relative to plant biochemistry, molecular biology, and food security.  The proposed meeting topics include: Plant responses to the environment, Plant-Pathogen and insect interactions, Plant nutrition, Plant/crop evolution, Epigenetic regulation of plant processes, Plant molecular systematics and biodiversity, Applied biotechnology, Association mapping and crop improvement, Comparative structural and functional genomics\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe international and local organizing committees will identify women, early career scientists and participants who are members of underrepresented groups.  The targets for participation are:  50% for female representation, 15% for underrepresented groups and 15-20% for early career scientists.",
