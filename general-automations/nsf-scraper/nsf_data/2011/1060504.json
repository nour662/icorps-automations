 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides approximately 14 scholarships each year during the 4.5-year grant period to academically talented, low-income Biology/Biotechnology undergraduate and graduate students at William Paterson University.  The project goals include increasing the number of Biology/Biotechnology majors entering research and education careers; increasing the retention and graduation rates of all Biology/Biotechnology students; increasing the number of minority students in the Biology/Biotechnology Graduate programs by 25%; and increasing the number of Biology/Biotechnology Masters degree recipients.  The project supports tutoring, mentoring, faculty-guided research experiences, career guidance and internships for the scholarship recipients.  The project addresses regional and national needs, and enhances the Biology/Biotechnology programs at the University by providing opportunities for graduate education for traditionally underrepresented groups.  The project results are being disseminated in various ways such as project reports and University publications and press releases to regional media outlets.",
