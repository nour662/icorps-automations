Excitonic solar cells, including allorganic, hybrid organic-inorganic and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), offer strong\r\npotential for inexpensive and large-area solar energy conversion.\r\nBroader Impact: \r\n\r\nThe symposium strongly encourages the participation of underrepresented groups,\r\nincluding Hispanics, Native Americans, and women, through appropriate travel and\r\nregistration support. Specific efforts to encourage their participation include: distribution\r\nof information encouraging women/ethic minorities, researchers from undergraduate\r\neducational institutions along with abstract acceptance.",
