GPU-based computing support for distributed memory parallel applications constitutes a specific novel feature of the cluster.\r\nThe work aims to support the following activities:\r\n- Modeling genomes, hyper-extractive economies, and ecological forecasting (by bringing much greater computational power) and,\r\n- Enabling new science utilizing the instrument to develop new algorithms in physics modeling and genomics. \r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nMainly, the multidisciplinary nature of the proposed research provides the broader impacts.   Expected are large broader impacts on basic physics research. It is expected to also impact on medicine through the development of better molecular models to view how our proteins and membranes interact. Planned are training activities of a new generation of researchers in tools and techniques for high-performance computing. The PIs would build on the broad past experience in preparing widely-used undergraduate and graduate educational materials, allowing students to perform real-world projects and impacting K-12 and STEM education. Hence, the project aims to significantly enhance and integrate our educational efforts at the K-12, undergraduate and graduate levels in bioinformatics.",

We begin with a talk on HPC and parallel computing, give a Beocat tour, then start the exercise. The reaction has been phenomenally positive from the girls. We also trained two groups of high-school teachers participating in our summer GK12 institutes to use these lessons in their own classrooms.\n\n-          We have also introduced parallel computing concepts into our freshmen computing concepts course, which has about 400 students per year.
