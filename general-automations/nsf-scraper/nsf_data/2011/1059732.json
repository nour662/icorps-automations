 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project expands understanding of the relations between a marginalized population and forms of local state practices. It is theoretically situated in such a way as to broaden the scope of geographic research on governmentality and it provides a health-oriented focus on geographies of citizenship.  The research plan involves data collection and interviews on the relations between two regulatory bodies and an emergent, but marginalized, population in Seattle, Washington during the period from 1950 through 1983. A non-probability, stratified snowball sample will be used to identify and interview the individuals selected for the study. Data will be analyzed using a grounded theory approach that identifies key moments in time at which the regulatory state attempts to govern populations that are designated as problematic. It will also determine individuals' resistance to these imposed actions of the state bureaucracies. Overall, the research project offers greater attention towards public health and licensing agencies and policies. It also captures the multiplicity of ways that citizens and state apparatuses relate to one another, including the micro-scale relations between citizens and local bureaucrats. \r\n\r\nThe project will provide policymakers and human rights commissions with a fuller account of the histories of state-agencies relations with marginalized groups, potentially identifying key moments of both success and failure with respect to questions of equality and freedom. Graduate students will be trained in qualitative research analysis, provide them with opportunities to collaborate in the synthesis and publication of results.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n  This project documented, described, and interpreted the relations  between a marginalized urban population (homosexuals), the Washington State Liquor Control Board, and the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health during the mid 20th Century (1945-83). Homosexuals were a focus because during the era legal, cultural, and political norms around sexuality were shifting. The two governmental agencies were chosen because these sorts of mundane arms of government are understudied in relation to urban politics and because they held potentially great power.  Seattle  was chosen because pilot research suggested regulatory bodies there were  quite engaged with the subject population. The project intellectually and  empirically extended and challengeed the literature on urban political  geography by exploring these processes. The goal was to determine whether or how  the spatial arrangements and practices of both the state and this  community affected each other as well as urban governance and community  development more generally.\n  We found that homosexuals and the spaces they congregated in were intensively and intimately  regulated by both the public health department and liquor control board.  The particular ways that these bodies and spaces were regulated changed over time.  There was an increasing sensitivity to social  identity on the part of public health authorities as well as an increased  collaboration between public health authorities and both  university-based researchers and community-based activists. The Liquor Control Board also found itself sensitive to the special circumstances of homosexuals. Finally, we found that homosexuals themselves colluded in these  processes by various forms of self-regulation.  This  self-regulation was found to be not just a function of anticipating  top-down state power.  It also became a marker of respectability and  responsibilization.\n  These results are interesting and important for a number of reasons:  First, most existiing urban scholarship points to contentious relationships between homosexuals and local state agencies.  This research calls that generalization into question.  Second, much scholarship on the politics of sexuality and public health suggest that \"AIDS changed everything\" by politicizing health issues for the first time, at least as they pertain to homosexuals.  This research challenges this argument as well.  Third, this research demonstrates the importance of university-based medical and public health research in the unfolding politics of community development among a marginalized population.  Fourth, this research demonstrates the value of an approach to urban social and political studies that emphasizes the roles and importance of mundane regulatory agencies and local political cultures in urban politics and community development.  In so doing, it offers lessons for scholars, policy-makers, and community-based actors alike around contemporary connections between publich health and various urban communities (e.g., liecensing of \"vice; recreational drug policies, etc.).\n  Finally, this research produced two valuable data sets that may be used by future researchers interested in buiding on our analysis or taking it in new directions.

These data sets could be used by researchers interested in questions quite different from ours, but that may utilize a similar approach (e.g., the politics of licensing; the social effects of participating in large federally-funded health research projects, or the unintend..."
