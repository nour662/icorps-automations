 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal focuses on Markov random fields and directed graphical\r\nmodels, classes of statistical models that are based on a marriage\r\nbetween graph theory and probability theory, and allow for flexible\r\nmodeling of network-structured data.  The core of the proposal\r\nconsists of multiple research thrusts, all centered around the goal of\r\ndeveloping practical algorithms and theory for statistical estimation\r\nwith network-structured data.  One research thrust concerns various\r\nissues associated with model selection in undirected graphical models,\r\nalso known as Gibbs distributions or Markov random fields.  Problems\r\ninclude determining the information-theoretic limitations of graphical\r\nmodel selection in high dimensions (where the number of vertices may\r\nbe larger than the sample size), not only for i.i.d. data but also\r\ndependent data; developing methods for tracking sequences of networks\r\nthat evolve over time; and developing methods for data with hidden\r\nvariables.  Another research thrust concerns various statistical\r\nproblems associated with directed acyclic graphical structures (DAGs),\r\nincluding estimating equivalence classes of DAGs in the\r\nhigh-dimensional setting; estimating causal relationships via designed\r\ninterventions; and efficient computational methods for DAG selection\r\nusing the Lasso and related methods.  Overall, the proposed research\r\nis inter-disciplinary in nature, drawing on techniques from\r\nmathematical statistics, convex optimization, information theory,\r\nconcentration of measure, and graph theory.\r\n\r\nScience and engineering abounds with different types of networks.\r\nExamples include social networks such as FaceBook and Twitter,\r\nnetworks of genes and proteins in molecular biology, network models\r\nfor economic and market dynamics, neural networks in brain imaging,\r\nnetworks of disease transmission in epidemiology, and information\r\nnetworks in law enforcement.  In the real-world, the structure of the\r\nunderlying network is not known, but instead one observes samples of\r\nthe network behavior (e.g., packet counts in a computer network;\r\ninstances of infection at given time instances of an epidemic; emails\r\nor text messages sent among a group of people), and the goal is to\r\ninfer the network structure.  Methods for solving this network\r\ninference problem have a broad range of applications.  Examples\r\ninclude inferring brain connectivity and disease etiology in\r\nneuroimaging studies, detecting terrorist cells in social networks,\r\nmonitoring intrusions in computer networks, and understanding the\r\nbasis of gene-protein interactions in systems biology.",
