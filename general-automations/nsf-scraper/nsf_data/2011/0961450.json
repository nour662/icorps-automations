 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cause of the bifurcating tracks of seamounts and seafloor swells in the Walvis Ridge area in the South Atlantic just off South Africa has been a longstanding enigma in Marine Geology and in our understanding of hotspots and the plate tectonic evolution of Africa. This project will go to sea to dredge and analyze rocks from the part of the seafloor to the west of the Walvis Ridge and examine changes from hotspot to diffuse volcanism. The present location of the Walvis hotspot and the reason for its waning volcanic activity over the last 60 Myr will also be determined. Argon trapped in minerals in the collected seafloor volcanic rocks will be used to determine the age progression of the volcano tracks. Rock, major and trace element geochemistry and isotopes will be used to see if the younger rocks in the bifurcated tracks can be linked to the older Walvis Ridge. Multibeam bathymetric mapping and a map of seafloor magnetics will also be generated to examine structural trends and plate tectonic motions of this part of the ocean floor. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration with a complementary German effort that is studying the older part of the Walvis Ridge, K-12 teacher and graduate and undergraduate student training, and support of a PI whose gender is under-represented in the sciences.",

The volcanic rocks from these seamounts provide a window to the deep mantle, probably from as deep as the core-mantle boundary, about half way to the center of the Earth. This is where we think the Walvis plume has its origin. From there it rises all the way through the mantle, starts melting and forming magmas at about 150-100 km depth and the magmas then rise and break through the rigid outer shell of the Earth (the plates), where they form the seamount volcanoes. The plates are what we live on and they are in constant motion over the surface of the Earth, which we call plate tectonics. The plates are rigid whereas the underlying hotter mantle moves like a liquid though it is important to note that it is not molten everywhere, only in special places like a mantle plume.</p>\n<p>The Walvis Ridge is special as its many seamounts are distributed over a large area (Figure 1) whereas other mantle plumes, such as Hawaii, form only a narrow line of seamounts. We asked if this is caused by the features of the plate, such as cracks in it, but found no support for this in our data. We asked if the drifting apart of the African and South American plates at the mid-Atlantic ridge (Figure 1) diverged the flow of the Walvis plume and indeed we found geochemical data that support this but only for a small area. When we look at the map of the Walvis Ridge it is narrow close to Africa but then forms a three-pronged fork (we call this the trident as it reminds us of Neptune&rsquo;s trident) and further west there is this wide area of seamounts (Figure 1). The northern prong of the trident is formed by this interaction of the Walvis Ridge with the mid-Atlantic ridge, we see this in the geochemical data.

Geophysicists imaged two features as big as continents and many times as high as Mt. Everest in the deep mantle, one of them the African large low shear wave velocity province (LLSVP). The Walvis Ridge is one of few places in the world where we can learn more about the composition of the African LLSVP. Increasingly detailed sampling of plume tracks on the ocean floor found that many form compositional stripes . The Walvis plume track shows stripes that persist since about 60 million years, much longer than observed anywhere else. It had been suggested that the origin lies in the contribution from a LLSVP to one stripe whereas the other stripe is formed from other mantle sources. We tested this with this project and found that the LLSVP can not explain the stripes of the Walvis plume track. More so, we found that instead of the usual two stripes, the Walvis plumes formed three stripes that trace over the seamount province despite the scattered distribution of the seamounts (Figure 1.b, 2). &nbsp;Although this suggests that the stripes are independent of the morphology, a key observation is that the Walvis Ridge only fanned out with the onset of the stripes.
