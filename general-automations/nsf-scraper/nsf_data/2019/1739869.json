 "awd_abstract_narration": "The promise of intelligent transportation systems is safety, mobility, and efficiencies well beyond current technologies. Yet, transportation engineers and planners must anticipate future transportation needs for which the enabling technologies are rapidly evolving while the change-over from old to new transportation technologies will take decades.  This project seeks to understand the impact of these trends for transportation engineering, offer approaches for effective shared control between autonomous vehicles and drivers, and provide insight into strategies to realize the promise of intelligent transportation systems.  The approach to studying traffic uses driving simulators, built on a high-performance computing architecture, that enables high-resolution, physics-based, realistic, interactive simulations, necessary for detailed modeling of vehicles and drivers under changing traffic conditions and various assumptions on autonomy, control, and connectedness, and for monitoring human driving behaviors.\r\n\r\nThis project identifies, characterizes, and shapes human cyber-physical interactions, bound to emerge in future mixed autonomous and conventional vehicle traffic. Its aims are to: (1) better understand human-cyber-physical interactions in mixed traffic, particularly driver trust in vehicle automation; (2) develop analytical and computational methods to assess the impacts on traffic capacity and regime transition for scenarios in which a driver switches from autonomous vehicle mode to conventional vehicle mode (e.g., loss of trust in automation scenarios); and (3) develop engineering solutions to enhance cyber-human interactions and traffic flow. The research embraces a multi-scale analysis approach anchored in human behavior analysis and interface design, modeling of mixed traffic and vehicle control, and system-level analysis of interdependency among human, vehicles, and traffic.  Understanding of human cyber-physical interactions through this project will enable better future designs of autonomous vehicles and the ways in which humans interact with these evolving systems safely and dependably.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
