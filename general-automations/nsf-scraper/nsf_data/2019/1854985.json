 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award renews an exemplary Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site on smart sensors and sensing systems at Michigan State University (MSU).  The RET Site will continue to develop a strong partnership between MSU and schools in the greater Lansing/mid-Michigan area to advance pre-college science and engineering education by training a cadre of leaders of middle and high school teachers in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The RET site will expose teachers to leading engineering and computing research spanning biological and chemical sensors, robotics sensors, human-computer interaction, microelectronic sensing circuitry and networks, energy and automotive engines, high performance computing for nuclear science, and sensing materials and manufacturing techniques, and will connect them to the profound changes that sensors and sensing technologies are having on the daily lives and the quality of life of all citizens. The interdisciplinary nature of the research theme will provide a fertile ground for developing creative and appealing middle and high school lessons and teaching activities in biology, physics, chemistry, and technology that align with state and national curricular standards. \r\n\r\nThe RET Site will expose teachers to cutting-edge research that has significant impact on the world today. Goals for this program are to train high-quality teachers that can inspire and prepare students for future college studies and careers in STEM fields, to improve teachers' skills in curriculum development, leadership, communication, and instruction, to implement and disseminate innovative curricula to connect university research activities to K-12 classroom practices, and to strengthen, sustain, and expand a long-term, healthy partnership between MSU, local school districts, and industry on advancing pre-college science and engineering education. Participating teachers will attend a 6-week summer institute to engage in cutting-edge research projects with mentoring from engineering faculty who lead vibrant sensor and sensing related research programs. Working with researchers, faculty mentors, and a curriculum development specialist, teachers will develop innovative, standards-compliant curriculum modules and participate in a number of professional development activities. The teacher-created modules and lessons will be disseminated nationally through TeachEngineering.org, a nationally recognized repository for searchable, standards-based engineering curricula.   Extensive follow-up activities are planned throughout the academic year to ensure the translation of lab experience into classroom practice, and to foster and strengthen long-term partnership between engineering faculty and the local school districts. A third-party professional program evaluator will track and evaluate the program and provide feedback for improvement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
