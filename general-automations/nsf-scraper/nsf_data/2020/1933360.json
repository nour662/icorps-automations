 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference (GSCC) will be held March 27-29, 2020 at the University of California, San Diego. This will be the 16th annual edition of the GSCC, which is traditionally organized by graduate students and has benefited greatly from NSF support in the past. The GSCC focuses on graduate student research presentations and will include keynote addresses by Boris Bukh (Carnegie Mellon University), Laura Escobar (Washington University in St. Louis), Dana Randall (Georgia Institute of Technology), and Jozsef Solymosi (University of British Columbia). The GSCC provides a unique and invaluable opportunity for graduate students in combinatorics to experience the benefits of taking part in a research conference. Giving their own presentations allows graduate students to develop their teaching and presentation skills, helping them further succeed as junior researchers.\r\n\r\nCombinatorics is a field of mathematics with applications to many disciplines. It is a vibrant area for new, innovative research that can involve problems and techniques within algebra, geometry, topology, probability, computer science, and analysis. This conference will keep junior investigators aware of the advances that have been made in this lively and exciting field. The GSCC provides a great opportunity for graduate students to network by meeting other young mathematicians with similar research topics, which can lead to potential joint research projects and opportunities for future collaboration.\r\n\r\nWebsite: https://sites.google.com/view/gscc2020/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
