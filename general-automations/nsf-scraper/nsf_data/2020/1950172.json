 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fifty undergraduate students (10 per year for five years) will be recruited to participate in a 10-week summer residential research experience in Atmospheric Science Department at Colorado State University. The vision is that graduate students in Earth System Science will reflect the diversity of life experiences and demographic characteristics of the US population. The intended impact of this REU-site is to recruit a talented and diverse pool of undergraduate students into graduate study in Earth System Science through the following objectives: (1) to provide a diverse cohort of undergraduate students the opportunity for discovery-based exploration of Earth System Science; (2) to give interns a feel of the graduate school experience; (3) to provide training in effective communication for cross-disciplinary studies, including those that apply data science methods to the Earth Sciences; and (4) to introduce students to the concept of implicit bias, its effects, and counter-measures to promote a more vibrant and productive scientific community.\r\n\r\nREU participants will experience the full research process:  choosing a topic; developing a research idea; conducting a literature review; building and using computer skills for research and presentation; leading their own research project (with guidance); learning and applying a variety of research methods to conduct quality research; learning about additional research methods through peer presentations, scientific lectures, and workshops; and presenting their research in written and oral formats to both the CSU Atmospheric Science community and to the broader scientific community. By the conclusion of the summer research program participants will be well-prepared to conduct scientific research and have a deeper understanding of the graduate school experience. Through the REU Site, students will establish a network of peers and mentors who will play an important role in the development of future Earth system scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
