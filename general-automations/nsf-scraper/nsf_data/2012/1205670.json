 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\n\t\r\nThe PREM Center: Interfaces in Materials at Texas State University - San Marcos (Texas State) will advance minority participation by integration of discovery-based materials research into innovative education and outreach programs.  The Texas State PREM is partnered with the Research Triangle Materials Research Science & Engineering Center (Triangle MRSEC).  The proposed research outcome of this joint effort will be a better understanding of how very small objects (10-1000 times smaller than a human hair) can organize into arrays.  Dispersions of nanometer-sized proteins, polymers, and inorganic materials are known as colloids.  This research will be integrated into education and public outreach via Propagation of Knowledge through Shared Mentorship, a model for collaboration between educational levels that will ensure a pipeline for increased participation in the STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\n \t\r\nTexas State is a Hispanic serving institution (HSI) located in Central Texas and has been recently classified as an Emerging Research University within Texas. The Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry is growing with research foci of 1.) science education, and 2.) interdisciplinary research at the biochemistry/materials interface.  The Department participates in a new Ph.D. program in Materials Science Engineering and Commercialization.  A partnership with world-class MRSEC scientists from Duke University, North Carolina State University, University of North Carolina and North Carolina Central University will significantly amplify infrastructure, educational innovation, scientific advances and prestige to outreach activities.  The combination of regional demographics, Texas State institutional commitment to materials research and the emerging research productivity of the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry creates an ideal environment to advance the goals of the PREM program.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\t\r\nThe proposed research is divided into two thrusts: 1.) Multiscale Colloid Interfaces, and 2.) Regulatory Control of Polymer Self-Assembly into Functional Nanomaterials.  In Thrust 1, an externally applied force (e.g., electric field) will guide the assembly of polymers, clay platelets and nanoparticles.  Controlled colloid assembly can dramatically affect properties such as conductivity and heat dissipation.  Thrust 2 is focused on assembly of proteins using small-molecule modifiers and nature's built-in regulatory processes.  Using a combination of theory and experiment, the outcome of this research will be a \"set of rules\" for building larger assemblies of proteins. Both colloid research programs require the combined efforts of the Texas State PREM and the Triangle MRSEC.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\t\r\nA principle objective of the proposed PREM is to increase minority participation in STEM disciplines.   Research results will be augmented with knowledge transfer concepts in our education program.  Entitled \"Propagation of Knowledge through Shared Mentorship - The Pipeline to Success in STEM Education,\" this pipeline will connect Texas State and MRSEC participants at all educational levels.  Elements in Thrust 3 that exemplify Propagation of Knowledge include: 1.) MRSEC graduate student/Texas State undergraduate collaborative pairings, 2.) the PREM Academy for high school teachers, 3.) the PREM Postdoctoral SEED Program, and 4) leadership development through a ladder of shared mentorship.  Using discovery-based projects, this center will produce transformative science and create effective models and methods to elevate participation of the regional minority population.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe PREM program at Texas State University ? Research Triangle Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) increased participation in materials chemistry at both the undergraduate and graduate level.  The university collaboration fostered discovery-based, world-class research which was the attractor to increase gender and racial representation.  The PREM program further integrated the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the burgeoning doctoral program in Materials Science, Engineering and Commercialization.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nDuring the lifetime of this award, there was a significant increase in productivity at MSI Texas State University.  78 peer-reviewed articles citing PREM support were published in high quality journals.  The average impact factor for all articles was great than 5.0.  Twelve of these publications were joint authorships with the Triangle MRSEC and seventeen were internal collaborations among Texas State faculty.  The average publication output of PREM faculty increased 227% during the award.  Over 95% of these publications had student co-authors.  The Texas State PREM had 328 presentations (oral and poster) with 53 internally co-authored presentations and 48 joint authorships with our MRSEC partner.  The PREM faculty leverage PREM funding to receive nearly $4M in additional extramural funding.\n\nAdvances were made in the fields of biomacromolecules, organization of colloids, nanoparticle synthesis and improve battery storage.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact:\n\nDuring this award lifetime, 144 undergraduates participated in research.  This cohort was composed of 54% female and 33% URM.  106 of these participants completed their undergraduate degree while still a PREM participant.  65 graduate students participated in PREM and 42 of those graduated while a PREM participant. The graduate student cohort was 35% female and 28% URM.\n\n            Thirteen Texas State faculty participated and were partially supported.  PREM was a factor in four, positive tenure decisions (three of these were female).  PREM faculty submitted over 135 additional funding proposals under the aegis of PREM.  Two Texas State faculty were named Distinguished Professor during the award.\n\n            Outreach was a large component of broader impact with a local focus on K-12 outreach.  The PREM also participated in the greater San Marcos STEM Fair that serves 1200 visitors annually.  The fair strengthens our interactions with local middle and high school teachers.  The PREM conducted a PREM Teacher Academy for four years to build material science themes into classroom activity.  Outreach always involved PREM students and the PREM student organization became such a responsive and student-organized body that it inspired formation of a department student advisory group.  The PREM student organization also self-initiated and conducted Student Research Symposia.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/15/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William Brittain"
