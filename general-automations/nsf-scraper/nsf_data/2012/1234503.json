 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to discover a framework that incorporates hazard resistant principles in green building design. Green building design attempts to reduce the environmental impacts of buildings, the construction and operation of which contributes significantly to total U.S. energy and water usage and waste generated. Buildings that are vulnerable to natural hazards are in direct conflict with green building ideals, because disaster-damaged buildings generate additional waste and require extra resources for repair. The core component of the proposed research is the formulation of a life-cycle assessment methodology that incorporates building environmental impacts and building hazard resistance. The effect of hazard resistance during each phase of a building?s lifespan is considered, accounting for 1) differences in building design and construction depending on the hazards considered, 2) maintenance, repair and renovation requirements, considering the risk of damage during hazardous events, and 3) disasters that shorten the building service life. The environmental impacts are quantified through a mathematical probabilistic assessment of hazard resistance, the results of which are incorporated in life-cycle analyses.\r\nIf successful, the research will facilitate the development of criteria connecting structural building design considerations for earthquakes, wind and snow loads with green building ratings that could be incorporated in building standards and design guidelines. The advancement of building performance science and metrics that integrate green building with hazard resistance evaluations is a transformative step toward a more sustainable built environment. The project will also lead to the development of a new multidisciplinary undergraduate course, Building Performance: Society, Sustainability, Safety and Style, which will use a LEED-platinum certified building on the University of Colorado campus as a laboratory to help students develop a more holistic understanding of building design. Students in the course will also participate in a long-term study aimed at understanding how interdisciplinary coursework prepares them for engineering careers.",
