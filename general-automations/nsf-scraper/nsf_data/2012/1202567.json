 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plasmas are gas-phase assemblies of ions, electrons, and neutral molecules/atoms. When materials surfaces are exposed to plasmas, many complex physical and chemical interactions take place. In particular, energetic ions can dislodge violently, interact electronically, or form chemical bonds with surface atoms. The formation and breakage of chemical bonds (reactions) between energetic gas-phase ions and surfaces are very poorly understood. This research is focused in improving the understanding of such reaction mechanisms and controlling the outcome of plasma-surface interactions. The experimental results will stimulate the development and testing of relevant theories, and introduce new knowledge on reactive scattering dynamics into chemical curricula.\r\n\r\nFindings from this research should impact surface science and plasma processing, important technologies for characterizing and treating, coating, or etching solid surfaces for applications ranging from surface functionalization, to microelectronics fabrication, and space exploration. The research should lead to a new paradigm for selecting plasma chemistries and conditions, based on the reactivity and overall scattering dynamics of specific ions formed in the plasma, thus speeding up and making less expensive the development of plasma processes for many applications.",
