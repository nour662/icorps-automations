The instrument enables an increased virtualization of storage, the concurrent access to storage under fault scenarios (e.g., RAID), and a series of data intensive applications. Lessons learned will be leveraged from the existing system in place, whereby the existing system and the new system will be integrated in a way that supports cloud and disaster recovery modes of operation. The project enables the following studies and research projects: \r\n-\tStudying of effective rates of errors and reliability at highly refined levels and seeking means to identify and manage additional classes of errors (e.g., misdirected writes);\r\n-\tCreating semi-analytical models to allow tunable storage characteristics within a lifetime-reliability-performance cost space; \r\n-\tRunning applications from data mining (including bioinformatics as drivers for proving the efficacy of the final system), to achieve new science in these data-intensive domains; and\r\n-\tConducting computer science research aimed at simplifying use of active storage computation.\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis instrumentation increases the institution?s capacity to conduct cutting-edge research in an inexpensive, fast, practical, reliable petascale storage for data-intensive applications. Significant computational power logically close to that storage enables new science. Student training (including underrepresented groups) will be emphasized. The knowledge dissemination through this effort could be significant.",
