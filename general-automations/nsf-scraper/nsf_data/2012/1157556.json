 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are proposing the Mariana Vent Larvae (MarVeL) Workshop to catalyze new collaborations between multi-disciplinary research groups from the U.S. and Japan, with the goal to develop a coordinated plan to study connectivity between hydrothermal vents in a region of high priority to the international community. S. Mitarai will serve as local host for the workshop in Okinawa. Our goal is to propose a coordinated research plan to our respective government agencies for an interdisciplinary and international study focused on the Mariana vents. These are the only vents in a marine protected area in U.S. waters. Our combined expertise and resources will enable insight into larval biology and dispersal in the deep sea.\r\n\r\nThere is a history of U.S. and Japanese research interests in the Mariana region, with collaborations generally involving geo-scientists (e.g., marine geology, geochemistry) and focusing on seafloor processes. Our collaboration involving physical oceanographers and biophysical modelers will extend studies up into the water column. Women scientists and early career scientists (postdoctoral researchers and graduate students) from both the U.S. and Japan will participate at the workshop.",

Despite decades of research on deep-sea vents, larval dispersal and population connectivity between these discrete and extreme habitats remain poorly understood. Connectivity, which occurs on time scales of one to several generations, is what ultimately drives the biogeography of the species that live at deep-sea vents. Understanding connectivity between vents requires expertise from multiple disciplines, including biology, physical oceanography, and the geo-sciences. In order to foster these new collaborations, the Mariana Vent Larvae (MarVeL) Workshop was held in Okinawa, Japan, in May 2012. The workshop had a total of 40 participants (19 Japan, 16 U.S., 2 Canada, 2 France, 1 Korea), including 13 postdoctoral and graduate students who received training and guidance for collaboration with researchers from diverse backgrounds. This grant from the National Science Foundation enabled U.S. participation at this workshop. The main objectives of the workshop were to: 1) Share state-of-the-art methods and data for studies of larval dispersal and population connectivity of deep-sea vent fauna, and 2) Develop a coordinated research plan to study connectivity between hydrothermal vents in the western Pacific, specifically considering the Mariana arc and back-arc. We targeted the Mariana region in part because of prior studies by U.S. and Japanese scientists, but also because many of the deep-sea vents in this region are in the new U.S. Marianas Trench Marine National Monument. Discussion also included the larger spatial scale context of connectivity with vents in other regions of the western Pacific. Outcomes of the workshop included sharing of data and samples, coordinated research proposals submitted in the U.S., Japan, and Canada, enhanced communication between scientists and managers of the Monument, and sharing the workshop discussions with the broader scientific community through the InterRidge program and International Network for Scientific Investigations of Deep-Sea Ecosystems (INDEEP). Research publications that involved participants of the workshop include those listed below, as well as an Open Access book published by Japanese collaborators in 2015. As part of the public outreach of this project, some participants at the workshop were interviewed by NHK (Japanese public television).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/19/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stace&nbsp;E&nbsp;Beaulieu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
