 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize the\r\nworld?s first cloud-based emotion measurement platform. Today, the majority of market\r\nresearch is expensive and slow, relying either on subjective self-reports or costly,\r\nobtrusive lab-based technologies. The proposed emotion measurement platform aims to\r\ndemocratize market research by translating nonverbal facial expressions into intuitive\r\nemotional insights. It also drives down research costs and improves market reach\r\nthrough the use of widely available webcams as the means to record faces. This\r\nplatform enables businesses of any size to capture consumer?s emotional reactions as\r\nthey engage with their brands, particularly in the areas of advertising, product design\r\nand packaging. For example, brand managers, marketers and agencies can optimize ad\r\neffectiveness by evaluating viewers' tacit, moment-by-moment emotional response, in\r\nreal-time over the web, and through the platform?s emotion norms database. The\r\ntechnical objectives of this project focus on implementing automated facial analysis as a\r\nscalable cloud-based software-as-a-service platform, building the emotion norms\r\ndatabase, and deploying the platform with leading market research partners.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to disrupt longstanding\r\nmethods in market research by objectively measuring people?s emotional experiences\r\na) unobtrusively b) in real-time, c) at scale, and d) cost-effectively. While this\r\ndifferentiated emotion measurement technology can be leveraged in several target\r\nmarkets, the company?s initial focus is on measuring advertising effectiveness and\r\nmedia research to deliver actionable insights to leading media and market research\r\ncompanies. In addition, the proposed cloud-based emotion measurement platform has\r\nthe potential to significantly accelerate research in behavioral sciences by enabling the\r\ncrowd sourcing of huge corpuses of naturalistic and spontaneous responses to a wide\r\nrange of interactions and experiences from online learning to social gaming. It also\r\nallows entirely new research questions to be asked, and tackled with ecologically valid\r\ndata, such as whether individuals on the autism spectrum respond differently to content.\r\nThus, in line with the origins of this technology, our product accelerates psychological\r\nand clinical research on social-emotional intelligence. The long-term vision for this\r\nsoftware as a service platform is to ?emotion-enable? the Internet, giving consumers and\r\norganizations the ability to add emotion context to all online interactions.",
