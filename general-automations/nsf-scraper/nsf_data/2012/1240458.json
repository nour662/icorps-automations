 "awd_abstract_narration": "1240458 (Hernandez).  Considerable research is being conducted worldwide on biofuels and renewable energy. Successful implementation of specific processes will require different clusters of expertise and key components. The proposed event will be configured as panels of experts highlighting the configuration of networks necessary to produce renewable feedstocks, biofuels, and bioproducts. Five panels of experts will be configured to discuss (1) Biodiesel from Algae at a Power Facility (Kemper County, Mississippi), (2) Biofuels from Wastewater Produced by Pulp and Paper Operations, (3) Prolysis Oils and Biofuels from Mississippi Pine, (4) Bioproducts from Biomass, and (5) Solar Power Applications.   Each panel of experts will be composed to 5-7 integrated presentations. The conference will inform biofuels stakeholders from industry, academia, and agriculture of advances in biofuels research, define the challenges facing the biofuels industry, and provide networking opportunities for people interested in collaborative research and/or employment in the ?green energy? arena. The organizing committee of the conference has selected specific renewable energy applications and will configure panels of experts to discuss specific technological and economic aspects in an integrated and sequential manner.  The conference will aid in the dissemination of the latest biofuels research in the areas of catalysis, feedstock preparation, and resource utilization. The conference will also foster collaborations among researchers in industry and academia, resulting in the further advancement of biofuel technology. The conference will have a positive impact on all types of attendees: scientists and engineers will learn about the latest methodologies in biofuels development; students will have the opportunity to present research and network with potential employers and/or graduate advisors; attendees from the general public will become more aware of the science behind biofuels and become more interested in how they can participate in ?green energy? advancement. By providing key information regarding biofuels on both academic and industrial levels and facilitating the networking of biofuels stakeholders, the 2012 Southeast Biofuels and Renewable Energy Conference will aid in the development of fuel technologies that are both ?green? and sustainable.",

Conference organizers built on the successes of the 2009, 2010, and 2011 MSU Biofuels Conferences, all sponsored by the National Science Foundation.  Activities for the conference were actually initiated on July 18 and 19 with a Biofuels Camp for elementary school students.  Another camp for high school students was provided on July 23-24.  The majority of the camp attendees were students from under represented minorities.  Both camps were educational, engaging, and fun.  Participants were introduced to production of biodiesel and ethanol from soybean oil and corn, respectively.  Students were informed about the problems associated with producing biofuels using food related feedstocks.  They were shown other alternatives to producing biofuels, such as the integration of biomass, wastewater treatment facilities, and microorganisms.   Information was also provided on the different engineering careers involved in the production and use of biofuels.   \n\nThe committee for the 2012 Southeast Biofuels and Renewable Energy Conference preselected specific renewable energy applications and configured a panel of experts to discuss specific technological and economic aspects in an integrated and sequential manner.  This unique approach focuses on specific aspects of the science and integration of different unit operations for a successful supply chain.  The conference explained the benefit and challenges of specific renewable energy applications.  The list of topics for the 2012 Southeast Biofuels and Renewable Energy Conference included:\n\nBiodiesel      from Algae at a Power Facility &ndash; Engineers and Scientists from General      Atomics, University of Kentucky, Mississippi State University, and the MS      Department of Environmental Quality were invited to explain the potential      to integrate processes involved in the production of oils from the carbon      dioxide emitted by a power generation facility.  This was a unique opportunity for academics and industry      representatives to view the integration of expertise related to CO2 concentration and feeding processes, algae growth and harvesting, oil      extraction, biodiesel production, and utilization of biodiesel.\n\n\nBiodiesel      from Wastewaters Generated by Pulp and Paper Operations &ndash; Agricultural      or industrial operations, such as pulp and paper producers, generate      billions of gallons of wastewater per year that are conventionally      pre-treated on-site via physical and/or biological processes prior to      discharge into the environment (i.e., rivers).  Presentations described evaluation of      these waters as the main raw material for generating a biodiesel feedstock      via lipid producing microorganisms at the International Paper Facility in      Redwood, MS.  Since the generation of large volumes of      biofuel feedstocks from microbial sources requires an abundant supply of      water, carbon, and inorganic nutrients, the availability of large volumes      of water onsite with the infrastructure to move and process this water is      very attractive.  Speakers from      International Paper, Mississippi State University, Bioenergy LLC, and      University of Connecticut presented the integration of technologies      necessary for the production of biodiesel from wastewaters, which would be      used as a fuel for the transportation of pulp and paper products.\nPyrolysis      Oils and Biofuels from Mississippi Pine &ndash; There is an abundant of      biomass in Mississippi.  Faculty      members from Mississippi State University, Enerkem, and Georgia Institute      of Technology provided integrated presentations describing the process of biomass      harvesting, and conversion of biomass into ethanol, hydrocarbons, and      specialty chemicals using thermochemical platforms.  \nBioproducts      from Biomass - There i..."
