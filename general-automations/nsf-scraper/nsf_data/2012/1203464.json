 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Robert Hard, Mr. Charles Speer will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. The research examines the subsistence strategies and landscape use by early inhabitants of the New World. Although the long standing view of the 13,000 year old Clovis culture is that its members were highly mobile hunters who moved from kill to kill, specializing in hunting extinct mammoth and other large mammals, mounting evidence suggests a wide array of behavior was practiced by these groups which were dispersed across the New World in a diverse host of environments. The classic model of describing Clovis behavior is based on three key elements: the discovery of Clovis stone projectile points with extinct large game, the exotic (non-local) stone with which Clovis projectile points were made, and the rapid spread of the Clovis cultural complex across the New World. This project will focus on determining the source of the flint or chert used to make Clovis period projectile points at the Gault site.\r\n\r\nOver most of the course of human existence people lived in small groups as hunters and gatherers and many scientists argue that behaviors characteristic of the species developed and are best understood within this context. Mr. Speer's research gains significance because it will provide insight into the range of likely behaviors which existed.\r\n\r\nClovis period stone tools found at the Gault archaeological site in central Texas run counter to the traditional model. At Gault, nearly 95% of the stone tools and 80% of all Clovis projectile points are made from material within the immediate vicinity. As the visual aspects of the stone are similar to others across a wide region of central Texas, a geochemical technique is employed to determine accurate provenance. The geochemical technique, Laser Ablation - Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass\r\nSpectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), will analyze the geochemistry of chert toolstone used in the manufacture of projectile points found at the site. The Gault Clovis projectile points appear to be made of the local material and not from visually similar non-local sources. This is in direct contrast with many Clovis sites that are dominated by projectile points derived from sources that are hundreds of kilometers away. This research analyzes artifacts from an important Clovis site to further understand mobility behavior and it takes subjective postulates concerning Clovis mobility and evaluates them with objective data.\r\nThe project will also help to develop a highly effective and reliable methodology for determining both intra- and inter-source variation.\r\n\t\r\nThis dissertation suggests that the Clovis cultural complex was widespread across the New World but the behavior elicited by Clovis peoples was varied and not uniform. The Gault site artifacts demonstrate that cultural diffusion may have allowed technological aspects of Clovis culture to spread rapidly across the New World, rather than long distance movement in search of game. This suggests pre-Clovis populations might have already been in place across the New World to allow for this rapid cultural diffusion.",

Mounting evidence suggests a wide array of behavior was practiced amongst the Clovis period hunter-gatherers who were dispersed across the New World in a diverse host of environments. This project focused on determining the source of the flint or chert used to make Clovis projectile points at one of the largest and complex Clovis sites in North America, the Gault Site, in order to better understand the mobility practices of Clovis hunter-gatherers. Clovis mobility was thought to cover long distances but the provenance of these projectile points suggests limited distance mobility of less than 30 kilometers punctuated by occasional long distance forays.\n                The visual aspects of chert are similar across a wide region of Texas. A geochemical technique called Laser Ablation - Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was used to determine accurate provenance. This technique was employed to determine the geochemistry of chert used in the manufacture of the Gault Site (41BL323) projectile points and compared them with geologic samples from several locations across the Edwards Plateau.  This research analyzed artifacts from an important Clovis site to understand mobility practices by evaluating subjective postulates concerning mobility with objective data. This project developed a highly effective and reliable methodology for determining both intra- and inter-source variation.\n                Of the 33 Clovis projectile points from the Gault Site that were tested, 21 were statistically similar in terms of their geochemistry to the 224 geologic samples tested from the Edwards Plateau. As more geologic samples are added to the database, it may be that more of the projectile points can be statistically attributed, in terms of their geochemistry, to the Edwards Plateau. Of the 21 that were geochemically similar to the Edwards Plateau, 15 could be identified at the regional scale (30-500km). This included nine from the Gault/Fort Hood Region, three from the Leon Creek region, and three from the Callahan Divide region. At the local scale (1-30km) two projectile points could be identified to a particular locale; those being Gault Source 1 and Gault Source 2. The Gault/Fort Hood area is approximately 300 kilometers to the southeast of the Callahan Divide, and 150 kilometers northeast of Leon Creek.\nThe 15 regionally identified are the most informative about the mobility practices of the Gault Site occupants. The Clovis projectile points from the Gault Site reflect a regional pattern of use with some forays to distant, non-local areas. The finding of exhausted projectile points that were produced from chert sources ranging from 150-300 km away, such as Leon Creek and the Callahan Divide indicate that groups were traveling to these places and abandoning exhausted projectile points on their return to the Gault Site.\n                The resulting data suggested that the Clovis cultural complex was widespread across the New World but the behavior elicited by Clovis period hunter-gatherers was varied and not uniform. The Gault Site artifacts demonstrated that cultural diffusion may have allowed technological aspects of Clovis culture to spread rapidly across the New World, rather than long distance movement in search of game.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/03/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by..."
