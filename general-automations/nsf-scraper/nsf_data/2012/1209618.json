The host scientist is Dr. Kang Sun.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to create a theranostic agent consisting of core/shell nanostructures with magnetic imaging cores and photoresponsive degradable shells loaded with drug compounds. The magnetic core improves contrast for cancer diagnosis using magnetic resonance imaging, while the degradable shell enables controlled drug release.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
