 "awd_abstract_narration": "To combat the urgent local need for improvements in mathematics and science education, the University of Mississippi (UM) Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, Teachers for a New Tomorrow (TNT), provides the support to expand and enhance the efforts of UM's Center for Mathematics and Science Education (CMSE) in addressing this issue. Through the TNT program, the CMSE provides unique opportunities for STEM majors to pursue a career in mathematics or science education, thus increasing the number of certified teachers prepared to teach science and mathematics in secondary schools. Thirty STEM majors are obtaining teacher certification in science or mathematics by enrolling as a double major (in STEM and STEM Education) or by enrolling in the School of Education's Master of Arts in Curriculum and Instruction (MACI) program. In addition to meeting course requirements, TNT scholars enrich their pedagogical knowledge by participating in the TNT Preparation Program by enrolling in CMSE's enrichment programs. These events and activities are designed to train pre-service teachers with additional education activities created specifically for TNT scholars. Once certified, TNT scholarship graduates fulfill their commitment by teaching in a partnered high-need school district at least two years for each year a Noyce scholarship award was received. The project's formative and summative evaluation processes ensure that the program maintains a focus of improving mathematics and science education in Mississippi. This program is a multifaceted endeavor that includes diversity in the partnering districts and in participants with focus on areas of greatest economic need.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe NSF Noyce Scholarship Program, titled Teachers for a New Tomorrow, at the University of Mississippi (UM) was housed within the Center for Mathematics and Science Education (CMSE).  The CMSE is a grant funded entity that improves mathematics and science education in Mississippi through professional learning and K-12 STEM experiences.  The TNT program began at UM in July 2012.  Through this program, the CMSE provided unique scholarship opportunities for STEM majors wishing to pursue a career in mathematics or science education, thus increasing the number of certified secondary school teachers with strong content knowledge in math/science.  STEM majors obtained teacher certification in science or mathematics by enrolling as a dual degree candidate in STEM and STEM Education or by enrolling in the School of Education?s Master of Arts in Curriculum and Instruction (MACI) Program.  In addition to meeting their course requirements, TNT scholars enrich their pedagogical knowledge by participating in the TNT Preparation Program which includes several of the CMSE?s established programs, events and activities designed to train pre-service teachers, plus additional programs created specifically for TNT scholars.  Once certified, TNT scholarship graduates fulfill their program commitment by teaching in a high-need school district for at least 1 year for every term (fall, spring, or summer) the scholarship was awarded to them (equivalent to 2 years of teaching service for every one year of scholarship).\n\nThe TNT program offered 65 term scholarships to 21 scholars from 2012-2020.  Each cohort of scholars had the opportunity to engage and participate in several CMSE events alongside faculty, staff and graduate students of UM.  The Noyce Scholarship Program at the CMSE and UM successfully hosted a STEM Educator Networking Event which brought past and present colleagues together in both a formal and informal setting that allowed the TNT Noyce Scholars and the CMSE Graduate Research Fellows an opportunity to establish a professional network.  This large and diverse group of pre- and in-service educations who are now located across the U.S. and serving in various math/science educational roles were given the opportunity to share their educational journeys and experiences, have meaningful conversations regarding STEM teaching/learning, discover the diversity among the different schools/universities/states being represented and form lasting relationships that would continue to evolve professionally.\n\n \nIn Spring 2014, the Noyce Scholars helped fulfill a teacher request to host a STEM Day Event.  These events have grown and thus the Noyce Scholars Program helped formally establish the structure of the STEM Exposure Experiences under the direction of the CMSE?s K-12 STEM Experiences Division.  Two offerings were created based on the grade level of students planning to attend: STEM Explorations (K-8th grade) and STEM Excursions (7th-12th grade).  \n\n \nIn addition to the STEM Exposure Experiences, the Noyce Scholars participated in the CMSE Learning Community, CMSE Reading Groups, Research Seminars, Math/Science Camps during the summer, STEM Ambassador Programs, Regional/State Conferences, Professional Development, and observing faculty teaching mathematics content courses for elementary/secondary education students.  The scholars also worked to create Collaboration Projects focused on Robotics, Virtual Reality, Mobile Planetarium, Engineering Concepts, and Vernier Lab Equipment that will continue to be used in the STEM Explorations hosted by the CMSE.  Manipulatives and resources are made available to teachers through a library check-out system that was also created by the Noyce Scholarship Program. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alice J Steimle"
