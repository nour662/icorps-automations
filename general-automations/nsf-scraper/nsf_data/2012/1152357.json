This project has the ambitious goal of introducing a completely new methodology for the analysis of chemical reaction mechanism, with an emphasis on providing an advanced understanding of homogeneous catalysis. The focus will be on the reaction path, which the reaction complex traces in the reaction valley. From the curving of this reaction path the chemical changes of the reaction complex can be derived. The reaction mechanism will emerge in form of \"snapshots\" of the reaction complex taken at the path critical points (which correspond to extremal points of the reaction path curvature). \r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the URVA analysis the mechanism of a wide variety of homogeneous catalysis reactions (including H2 generation and CO2 consumption) will be determined and results will be presented in a generally accessible reaction library. The URVA programs and the reaction library will be made available to the scientific community via the group's web page. New courses in computational chemistry and reaction dynamics for undergraduate and graduate students will bring the new methodology to the classroom.",

URVA (Unified Reaction Valley Approach) studies of more than 400 catalyzed chemical reactions (Fe, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, Au, etc. catalysts) have been collected in a reaction library, which provides new and unique insights into catalysis.

This is based on the vibrational modes and their influence on the reaction path curvature as a highly sensitive indicator for the electronic structure changes of the reaction complex during the chemical reaction. The scalar curvature &kappa;(<em>s</em>) of a reaction contains all mechanistic information, which is obtained by decomposing &kappa;(<em>s</em>) into local vibrational mode components. The latter are easily associated with bond breaking/forming or other chemical processes. A curvature maximum and the path regions up/down to the two adjacent curvature minima define a <em>reaction phase</em>. Chemical, pre-chemical, and post-chemical phases can be distinguished.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Although catalysis can have many different facets, URVA studies suggest that there are only a few electronic principles that are characteristic of catalysis. In general, chemical reactions are initiated by charge transfer/charge polarization processes. One of the reaction partners is labialized and adopts an active form that &ldquo;drives&rdquo; the reaction. The simplest form of catalysis is the <em>electrostatically-driven catalysis</em>: Mechanistic features of the non-catalyzed reaction are enhanced by the presence of Lewis acids/Lewis bases, polar solvents, solid surfaces, etc. We have found many examples of push-pull effects that increase the charge-transfer/charge-polarization effects and that are typical of the electrostatically-driven catalysis. The lowering of the energy barrier of the catalyzed reaction is moderate in these cases.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A closely connected type of catalysis is the <em>coordination-sphere-driven catalysis</em> that is typical of transition metal complexes. The latter catalyze a chemical reaction by extending the coordination sphere of the transition metal to facilitate a specific charge-transfer/charge-polarization effect. This is often associated with<em>&nbsp;agostic bonding&nbsp;</em>in a general way: Charge transfer takes place from an exposed part of the reactant to a vacant, low-lying orbital of the transition metal and, guided by this transfer, the reactant &ldquo;docks&rdquo; into a natural or enforced hole in the coordination sphere of the transition metal. Geometrical features of the reaction complex come into play for the <em>space-confinement-driven catalysis</em>, which requires that the catalyst generates a compartment that determines the stereochemistry of the reaction.

It is obvious that this type of catalysis requires a larger catalyst, which is able to generate a suitable compartment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One example of a <em>coordination-sphere-driven catalysis</em> is the rhodium catalyzed hydroformylation, an important industrial process for the worldwide formaldehyde production. The first step of the catalytic cycle of this process, the ethene insertion, &nbsp;is summarized in Figures <strong>1</strong> &ndash; <strong>6</strong>. The energy diagram of this reaction (Fig. <strong>1</strong>) already indicates that the H transfer from rhodium to carbon seems to proceed in an unusual way, which one can analyze with the reaction force (first derivative of E(<em>s</em>); Fig. <strong>2</strong>) or the energy concentration (second derivative of E(<em>s</em>); Fig. <strong>2</strong>). Neither reaction force nor energy concentration diagram provide a mechanistic dissection of the H-transfer that is useful.

Due to the assistance by the Rh-C bond, the Rh-H bond can be converted stepwise into an agostic, then anagostic bond, and finally a weak Rh,H-interaction (&ldquo;<em>quantized bond breaking</em>&rdquo;). The protonic H (Fig. <strong>4</strong>) seems to &ldquo;slide over&rdquo; the Rh-C bond, which is formed for this purpose (M2 to M6, Fig.s <strong>3</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, <strong>6</strong>) and then cleaved again, i.e. the ethene is first bonded to Rh via a &pi;-complex, then in the form of a rhodacyclopropane, and finally as &sigma;-ligand. <em>The temporary formation of an auxiliary-bond is one of the many fascinating tools nature uses to accelerate chemical reactions, that can be successfully deciphered by URVA2016.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/07/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Elfi&nbsp;Kraka</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1152357/1152357_10187801_1475853075276_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1152357/1152357_10187801_1475853075276_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig 3.
