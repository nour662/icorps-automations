Through several clearly defined initiatives that include semester-long facilitated dialogue processes to improve departmental climate, re-imagined spaces, a focus on the intellectual and life history of senior and retired women to amplify women's presence, an interactive search and selection portal, an innovation tournament to tap the power of diversity and divergent thinking, and an Advance Enhancement fund to support STEM women's research and scholarship, the University of Virginia will engage both women and men faculty in open and authentic dialogue about a shared and inclusive future for the institution. Drawing on a complex, diversity systems theory of change as adaptive, this transformation initiative will lead to seminal social science results and promote interventions to render institutional physical environments more welcoming for diverse groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUVA CHARGE PROJECT REPORT\n\nThe goal of the University of Virginia ADVANCE Program (UVA CHARGE), funded by $3.2 million in grants from the National Science Foundation, has been to increase the number of women, including URM women, in the STEM and social science disciplines. We hoped to create an empowered collaborative, participatory form of community that drew on the collective capacity of women faculty, their colleagues, and administrative leadership allies to identify and ameliorate the structural and cultural barriers to women's full participation in academic STEM careers. The four initiatives were: departmental diversity, voices and visibility, Tournament of Ideas, recruitment, and enhancement funds.  Through these clearly defined initiatives, the University of Virginia has engaged all faculty in open and authentic dialogue about a shared and inclusive future for the institution. As a result, much of UVA CHARGE?s work has been codified in new search protocols, new promotion and tenure guidelines, and a wealth of training and development activities.  Drawing on a complex, diversity systems theory of change as adaptive, this initiative led to seminal social science results, promoted interventions to render institutional physical environments more welcoming for diverse groups, and integrated these initiatives into University strategic efforts to improve and enhance the lives of women faculty in STEM/SBE. In addition, the grant resulted in multiple publications, from journal articles and books to op-ed pieces in national venues.  Finally, UVA CHARGE material, including annual reports, presentations, photographs and more is now archived and fully searchable by interested researchers.  \n\nOur work reveals that the institution?s visual signals, intended or unintended, in academic buildings and other spaces are important factors that impact women?s sense of belonging and safety. UVA CHARGE successfully understood that equity must include both allocational resources as well as symbolic messages and resources.  UVA CHARGE offered public programs focused on women?s? contributions to STEM knowledge for the University and surrounding community, from plays to art exhibitions. \n\nWe would encourage other ADVANCE grantees to seek allies among university leadership (and beyond) early and start conversations about institutionalization at once.  Using the adaptive model of change, we sought consensus and buy-in by conducting focus groups and need assessments prior to designing and implementing programs, asking administrators and faculty what would be helpful to them.  We strove to make UVA CHARGE salient to faculty, couching our initiatives in evidence-based language rather than adopting the language of values.  We adopted a participatory ethos, and sought to design programs that were inclusive and supportive rather than combative or punitive. \n\nUVA CHARGE found its greatest success in building a committed, far-reaching group of allies, ranging from leading administrators, to deans, faculty and staff.  Over the grant period, UVA realized positive demographic shifts in hiring, institutionalized improvements in the promotion and tenure process, and innovative training and support for search committees.  As important, our work was successful in creating significant shifts in climate and culture across the University, as well as changes in the physical environment.\n\n \n\nDEMOGRAPHICS for STEM/SBE faculty in the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (the College) and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) \n\nIn the College, total women faculty grew from 22.4% in 2012 to 27.5% in 2018.  Total tenured and tenure-eligible women grew from 20.5% in 2012 to 25.7% in 2018.  Smaller gains are seen in URM faculty while the College added 8 URM faculty, of whom 4 were women, during the period, increased overall hiring means that these groups now represent a slightly smaller percentage (12% vs. 15% in 2012 for URM faculty) of the whole. In SEAS, total women faculty grew from 15% in 2012 to 20% in 2018.  From 2012 to 2018, the SEAS added 9 tenured and tenure-eligible women in STEM/SBE, of whom 3 were URM.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/24/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gertrude J Fraser"
