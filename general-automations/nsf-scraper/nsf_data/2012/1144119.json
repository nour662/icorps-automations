 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the phylogeny of green lacewings (Family Chrysopidae) using DNA sequences combined with external characteristics for all types of living and fossil species. Although there are a number of widespread, common species, the family includes at least 1200 species, many of which are poorly known and still undescribed and we lack a clear understanding of evolutionary patterns and processes in the group.  The phylogeny will be used to explore how chrysopids evolved trash-carrying in larvae and how adults use chemicals from flowers and insect prey to attract mates. A vocabulary of descriptive morphological terms for lacewings will be defined, with terms related to each other and to those used for other insects, so that they have universal meaning when related back to gene expression. This effort will deliver products such as web-based identification tools and a monograph on world genera.\r\n\r\nGreen lacewings are used widely throughout the world in Integrative Pest Management in both field and horticultural cropping systems as generalist predators. Thus, the phylogenetic results from this project may lead to the discovery of new species that may also be of economic importance in agriculture. The findings will also enable greater understanding of lacewing evolution, including how and when certain behaviors and biology appeared. The project will contribute to the broader goal of developing a Common Arthropod Ontology, linking phenotype (i.e. appearance) to genotype (i.e. genetics) in all insect-like organisms. This project will also provide training for two community college interns, a PhD student, and a postdoctoral researcher.",

Using these data we explored how various interesting characteristics of lacewings have evolved, such as defensive camouflaging behavior in larvae.
