 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research(SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of printing and integrating custom, unconventional form factor batteries utilizing a zinc-metal oxide battery chemistry with a novel ionic liquid gel electrolyte into next generation robotic systems. Conventional batteries have been unable to address the inherently challenging power system needs of robots: light and mobile, inherently safe, composed of cheap and sustainable materials, easily integrateable into non-planar formats, and able to survive extreme environments. As the field of robotics advances, what is being demanded of its batteries is a fundamental evolution in its materials, engineering, and architecture. Solution-based print manufacturing is used because the fabrication method is dynamic and enables batteries to be manufactured in a variety of form factors and on planar and non-planar substrates. In robotic devices, batteries can be incorporated into structural materials, conformably coated onto surfaces, or integrated within the electronic circuit boards to enable greater power performance that will increase the run-life and functionality of the robot. The aims of this project are to benchmark its battery technology's cycle life and extreme environmental stability capabilities, demonstrate the printing of custom series and parallel battery system configurations, and showcase its unique flexibility properties. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts/commercial potential of this project are the establishment of a new battery technology and manufacturing paradigm which can be disruptive to markets requiring novel device functionality and form factors. The significant reduction of the cost and environmental impact of batteries offer an opportunity to key segments such as robotics the opportunity to repurpose and revitalize the printing industry to manufacture next generation batteries. Success in this project will showcase this battery technology's feature set and manufacturing methodology to further differentiate itself from its competitors, increase customer interest, secure early customer development funding or partnerships, and meet specifications needed to scale towards producing commercial products. Past approaches to battery miniaturization have been met with significant barriers that have limited market acceptance and restrained development of a variety of burgeoning fields requiring portable power. A prime example is the robotics market and more specifically the wireless and wearable technologies sectors, which could be revolutionized by the battery technology and manufacturing approach presented in this project.",
