 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mw 9 March 11, 2011 Tohoku earthquake, resulting in 25,000 fatalities, was the largest\r\nearthquake to strike Japan in modern times. The failure of long-term forecasts to anticipate an\r\nevent of this magnitude is leading to a reevaluation of our scienti\fc understanding of subduction\r\nzone fault dynamics. At the same time, the enormous Japanese investment in seismic and\r\ngeodetic monitoring provides an unprecedented opportunity to study processes leading to giant\r\nearthquakes. The investigators will focus here on two aspects of the quake that raise central issues for our ability\r\nto forecast future hazards globally: 1) the constraints that geodetic strain accumulation place\r\non the seismic moment budget, and 2) how the distribution of mechanical properties on the\r\nplate interface control seismic versus aseismic slip.\r\n\r\nForecasts of seismic hazard rely primarily on the historical record, paleoseismology, and\r\ngeodetic strain accumulation. While a strict time-predictable model has proven inconsistent\r\nwith geodetic data in some areas, the rate of strain accumulation must strongly in\r\nuence the recurrence rate and/or size of large earthquakes. Previous analyses of the extensive Japanese\r\nGPS data set regularize the underdetermined inverse problem; the inferred plate coupling is\r\nthus conditional on the choice of regularizing functional. In addition, most assumed no coupling at the trench, an area that effectively lies in the model null-space. The researchers propose rather to estimate rigorous bounds on the moment deficit rate, independent of any regularizing functional. They also propose to systematically explore the effects of time-dependent viscoelastic effects on estimates of slip deficit.\r\n\r\nThe Tohoku earthquake also raises profound questions about the frictional properties of\r\nthe subducting plate interface. Mw > 7 events along the Japan-Kurile trench have repeated\r\nin nearly the same locations. Substantial afterslip following these events suggested that the\r\nfault surrounding these seismic `asperities' have different frictional properties, e.g., velocity\r\nweakening `asperities' surrounded by velocity strengthening regions. The fact that the March\r\n11 earthquake seems to have ruptured through both areas raises important questions. Is the\r\nasperity paradigm fundamentally flawed? Or did the M 9 activate other weakening mechanisms\r\n(thermal pressurization?) that allowed it to rupture through velocity strengthening regions?\r\n\r\nTo distinguish between competing hypotheses the researchers will use a combination of GPS data based\r\nhypothesis testing and physics based fault modeling. They will test whether or not post-seismic\r\nGPS data can be fit with afterslip only in regions that have not experienced seismic slip in\r\nthe last several decades. They will test alternative physical models that could account\r\nfor the observed behavior, by extending our numerical codes that couple rate-state friction,\r\nthermal pressurization, and dilatant strengthening to three dimensions. This will allow them to\r\ntest for example whether dilatancy could stabilize slip in otherwise velocity weakening regions,\r\nor thermal pressurization could allow ruptures to extend into velocity strengthening areas.",
