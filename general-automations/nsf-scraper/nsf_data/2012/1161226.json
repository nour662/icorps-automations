 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The projects in this proposal would generalize the highly\r\ninfluential tables of Cremona to the next (ordered by discriminant) totally real\r\nnumber field and to higher dimensional modular abelian varieties. This would\r\nimprove on algorithms available for computing with elliptic curves and abelian\r\nvarieties, and provide useful data and tools for number theory researchers. The\r\nproposed research would also advance techniques for constructing points and coho-\r\nmology classes on elliptic curves, and for understanding the arithmetic of elliptic\r\ncurves over number fields. This project would have as a concrete deliverable new\r\npublicly available tables and software that will be of use to many number theorists.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The PI is co-authoring a popular expository book with Barry\r\nMazur on the Riemann Hypothesis, co-authoring a graduate level book with Ken-\r\nneth Ribet on modular forms and Hecke operators, and intends to release a new\r\nedition of his modular forms book. The PI has tables of data that are freely avail-\r\nable online, and whose creation has been supported by NSF FRG grant DMS-\r\n0757627, and the proposed research would expand these tables further. He will\r\nalso continue to organize the development of the free open source NSF-funded\r\nSage mathematical software project that he started. The PI organizes dozens of\r\n\"Sage Days\" workshops that involve many undergraduate and graduate students,\r\nand touch on number theory, algebraic topology, combinatorics, special functions,\r\nnumerical computation, and other areas. The PI is also a co-PI on the UTMOST\r\nNSF grant (DUE-1020378), whose goal is to make Sage more accessible to high\r\nschool and college teachers and students.",
