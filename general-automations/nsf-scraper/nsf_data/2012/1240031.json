 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partners for this Track 1 project include George Mason University (GMU), Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA), and the Fairfax and Prince County Public Schools. The partnership between NOVA and GMU is designed to insure that NOVA students have a smooth transition into the program at GMU and to encourage them to both major in a science and seek a teaching credential in a STEM field. The project offers Undergraduate Learning Assistantships to sophomores and second semester freshman at both GMU and NOVA (a total of 50 at GMU and 83 at NOVA), Noyce Scholarships to junior and senior STEM majors interested in becoming secondary school STEM teachers (a total of 36) and a streamlined process for Noyce Fellows to gain teacher certification. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project is modeled after a highly successful Noyce project at the University of Colorado Boulder and takes advantage of an existing project at George Mason established to increase the number of STEM majors recruited retained and graduated, The College of Science Accelerator Program (a program that includes the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology, and Forensic Sciences). \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The broader impacts of the project are its potential, through a Learning Assistants Program that includes specific attention to teaching at both the university and K-12 level, to set a model for involving students early in their academic career in a program that both adds to their content knowledge in STEM and to their interest and skills in teaching STEM.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAward Title:  Noyce in Northern Virginia\n\nAward Number:  1240031\n\nOur Noyce project encompassed 31 Noyce scholars, supporting them in becoming secondary STEM teachers at high needs schools.  They span most STEM majors: Math, Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science and Physics; and all obtained teaching positions immediately after graduation.\n\nWe provided opportunities for them to work in classrooms on campus, to work with black and Hispanic high school girls in week-long camps in the summer and to work in summer camps with in-coming freshmen (primarily minority students).  Our scholars did this teaching with faculty using active learning techniques in their classrooms. \n\nMany of the scholars reported that they used the teaching techniques they learned at Mason in their secondary classrooms, and that they felt they were well prepared for their first year of teaching. There are many success stories to be told.  For example, some have given talks to their colleagues on techniques they use, encouraging active learning among their colleagues.  One scholar was already chosen as teacher of the year for his school district and some scholars have been asked to teach AP courses at their respective schools even though they are relatively new to the schools.  One of our scholars who teaches almost exclusively ESOL students, has raised the pass rate of her Algebra I students from 22% to over 50%.\n\nThree of our in-service Noyce scholars have been instructors in our summer math bootcamp for incoming freshmen.  One of whom will take over as the leader of the camp next summer.  We are still in contact with most of the scholars and continue to mentor them and assist when it is needed.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mary Nelson"
