However, we know relatively little about the experiences of immigrants who arrived in the United States as children and are now young adults. This project is grounded in existing empirical and theoretical literature on immigrant assimilation.  It examines how these young adults have experienced both social exclusion and inclusion, and how this affects their feelings of belonging, their identification with and their participation in U.S. society.  This dissertation will also address the degree to which their experiences differ by educational status and gender, as well as the immigration and naturalization process per se, which typically takes many years and has had a profound impact on their formative childhood and adolescent years.  To address these research questions, the project relies on 120 interviews with young adults of Mexican origin.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis research seeks to inform our understanding of the conditions under which young immigrants adjust to and identify with U.S. society and culture.   Improving our understanding the factors that facilitate the successful incorporation of young immigrants may influence public discourse regarding immigration policy reform.  It may also contribute to efforts that promote immigrant integration, social mobility, and social cohesion. Finally, findings may be of interest to a variety of stakeholders, including but not limited to community and social service organizations, education officials, law enforcement, and policy makers.",
