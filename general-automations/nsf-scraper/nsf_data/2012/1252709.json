The members of U.S. Team for this project come from TERC, WGBH and Northern Illinois University.   The project involves two intensive, 5 day workshops to identify new measurement instruments to be integrated into each other's research and development work.  The major research question is to what degree learners in the two cultures respond similarly or differently to the STEM learning games.",
