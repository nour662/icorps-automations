The workshop will bring together participants from US and India to identify promising areas of common interest and models for sustainable collaboration including NSF's SAVI mechanism. Attendees will be chosen to represent 3 areas: Big Data Software Platforms, Accelerated Systems Infrastructure, and Scientific Applications of societal significance. The workshop will be co-located with the well established HiPC conference, to be held in Pune, India in December, 2012. The participants from India will be supported through grants from the Department of Science and Technology, India.",
