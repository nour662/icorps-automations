 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to demonstrate novel silicon-integratible graphene-based\r\ndevices, including the metal-oxide-graphene-silicon field-effect transistor to achieve drain\r\ncurrent saturation with a zero bandgap, and the graphene-insulator-graphene junction to achieve\r\nresonance tunneling. These devices are expected to harness the enormous momentum behind\r\nsilicon manufacturing, exploit the unique advantages graphene while circumventing serious\r\nchallenges, thus find niche applications for technology entry, and eventually enter the\r\nmainstream digital arena with full potential enabled by future progress.\r\nIntellectual merit: This project represents coherent research efforts spanning materials, concepts,\r\nand implementation. The materials growth research will seek answers to fundamental questions\r\nabout heteroepitaxy of two-dimensional layers. Novel device concepts, with deep roots in\r\nproven ideas (modulation doping and resonant tunneling), uniquely take advantage of the\r\nmaterial properties. Implementation of the concepts incorporates realistic engineering\r\nconsiderations from materials and processing to structures and modeling, and represents sound\r\nengineering practice.\r\nBroader impact: New discoveries will be introduced to undergraduate and graduate students, not\r\nonly to convey knowledge, but also to stimulate curiosity and enthusiasm. Outreach activities\r\nsuch as the PI's partnership with a local high school will impact K-12 science and math\r\neducation. The nature of the proposed research provides an excellent multidisciplinary research\r\nplatform for graduate students. This project will enhance diversity by involving and training\r\nfemale graduate students and by recruiting young minds from underrepresented groups. The\r\nsuccess of this research will potentially create US jobs by complementing the dominant, largely\r\noverseas silicon-based fabrication with graphene-based niche technologies.",
