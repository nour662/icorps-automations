 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project investigates what can be done before an event to improve inter-agency communication and coordination during a disaster.  Due to a number of social, economic, developmental, physical and environmental factors, natural disasters like floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires are anticipated to increase.  Consequently, we need to have a better understanding of how communities can respond to and better prepare for disasters.   This project is unique in two ways.  First, it will examine whether factors like attachment to community, inter-organizational relationships, and network leadership are associated with better community preparedness.  Second, the research will measure these factors in communities ahead of a disaster to see if they lead to better communication and coordination when an actual disaster happens.  Wildfires, because they are one of the most commonly occurring natural disasters in the United States, are the focal events of this research. \r\n\r\nThe results from the research will help improve disaster management by providing information that can inform how the many agencies, organizations, and groups involved in disaster preparedness and response can better organize themselves to create more disaster resilient communities.  These lessons for better disaster management will be communicated directly to partner agencies and organizations, such as the U.S Forest Service Fire and Aviation Management, National Incident Management Organization and various state and local wildfire response organizations.  The investigators will also share this work more broadly with the interested public, as well as professional and academic audiences.  Conducting the research will provide opportunities for student training, as well as expand research partnerships with leaders in key agencies interested in disaster scholarship.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis is a sub project under award #1161755.  The first paragraph of that report is here, the rest is under that award number.\n\nTo date, our study entitled ?A Pre/Post Disaster Investigation of the Effect of Network Capacities on Disaster Response? has made several significant contributions in the realms of methodology, advancing theory, and informing practice.   Methodologically, we developed  advanced methodologies for how to conceptualize and empirically bound disaster response networks as well as how to measure network performance within these networks.  Historically, applications of social network methodologies have relied heavily on convenience samples of archival information such as daily briefing or news reports.  This study developed and executed a standardized protocol of network identification and bounding that created comparable network datasets across over 100 at risk communities pre-disaster and subset of 21 communities that actually experienced a large scale wildfire.  Doing so required that we grapple with theoretical and methodological challenges associated with defining the boundaries of latent disaster networks.  In Faas, Velez, Nowell, and Steelman (under review), we provide a detailed account of our methodological approach for how such networks could be conceptualized and operationalized to allow for longitudinal comparability pre- and post disaster across multiple disaster sites to inform future research. In Nowell, Velez, Hano, Sudweeks, Albrecht and Steelman (under review), we investigate the methodological and theoretical tradeoffs associated with this process of network boundary determination and offer a decision rubric for informing future research on what methods may be most appropriate under what situations.
