The research will be carried out in off-line simulations and then implemented on a real-time simulator.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThe behavior of renewable energy sources is uncertain and variable, and it is difficult for static optimization methods to optimize uncertain non-stationary distributed energy resources in a smart grid for maximum utilization. A novel ACD controller is proposed for the development of a real- time dynamic stochastic optimization smart grid engine. Advanced intelligent methods such as the biologically inspired artificial neural network and smart devices (CNTs) provide better identification and control capabilities for implementation of optimal power flows.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nEconomically operated reliable and secure power systems that can accommodate high penetration of renewable energy are of national interest.  Being able to route power through underutilized lines will have major economic and environmental benefits due to avoiding the need for new lines. This project will have several dissemination channels, including software, websites, new contents added to existing courses, special sessions and tutorials at conferences, and journal publications.",
