 "awd_abstract_narration": "1236764\r\nPI: Basu\r\n\r\nCapillary migration, a well-known phenomenon, is the directed transport of a droplet when the continuous phase presents a gradient in interfacial tension (IFT).The vast majority of prior literature has focused on thermocapillary migration, where the IFT gradient is due to a temperature profile.  Due to the relatively weak coupling between temperature and IFT, the resulting forces and migration velocities are limited.  The objective of this project is to investigate the capillary migration of droplets in gradients of surfactant concentration.  This approach exploits microfluidic techniques to generate precise two-dimensional surfactant gradients in microchannels, orthogonal to the direction of flow, which are then used to control the capillary migration of droplets. Due to the strong coupling between surfactant concentration and IFT, this can achieve greater than two orders of magnitude capillary force and hence substantial migration velocities without heating the droplet. A novel feature is that the migration velocity of the drop is inversely related to its interfacial properties, which in turn depends strongly on its chemical composition.  As a result, tensiophoresis has the unique ability to passively sort droplets by their chemical contents, without additional chemical labels or actuators.  This project, primarily experimental in focus, will build a fundamental understanding of the phenomenon and demonstrate its application through the following specific  aims: 1) Design microfluidic devices which generate linear and logarithmic gradients in surfactant concentration; 2) Verify the scaling of droplet migration over several operational regimes determined by surfactant concentration, geometric length scales, and viscosity; 3) Investigate the impact of surfactant properties and dynamics on transport regimes; and 4) Use tensiophoresis for label-free droplet sorting based on protein concentration. \r\n \r\nThe life sciences industry is moving towards progressively smaller reaction volumes in order to reduce the costs and environmental footprint of high throughput screening.  Performing such assays in microdroplets can reduce reaction volumes by 3-6 orders of magnitude compared to conventional technology.  This dramatically reduces reagent consumption, improves assay throughput, and enables novel types of biological assays (for example, single cells) not possible with conventional tools. This research will contribute the first label-free method for sorting droplet reactors based on their chemical composition.  Given the critical importance of high throughput screening in modern biological research, this technology will ultimately benefit medical diagnostics, environmental analysis, and basic science. On the fundamental level, this project contributes to two scientific areas.  In the context of multiphase processes, it will discover novel ways to control and apply the phenomenon of capillary migration, and build a unique experimental platform for studying non-equilibrium physicochemical hydrodynamics at liquid-liquid interfaces.  In the context of separation science, tensiophoresis can be considered a new category of phoretictransport phenomena which enables the sorting of liquid droplets on the basis of their interfacial properties.  The interdisciplinary nature of this work will provide a valuable training environment for graduate students, including women and underrepresented minorities recruited through Wayne State SURA program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the field of microfluidics, scientists and engineers are interested in ways to move small droplets of water in oil.  These droplets serve as small, isolated containers to perform biochemical reactions.  The advantage of using droplets for reactions (instead of a beaker or plastic tray) is that droplets can be made very small - with volumes &lt; 1nL - and this helps researchers conserve the use of expensive reagents or precious patient samples.  The tiny volumes also enable droplets to conduct new types of assays (or tests) with single cells.\n\nTo perform biochemical assays in droplets, we need methods to physically move the droplets, and detect contents within them.  This proposal investigated a new method called tensiophoresis, which has the ability to move droplets and detect proteins within the droplets.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nTensiophoresis is a technique of moving a droplet by controlling the concentration of surfactant molecules on its surface.  Other methods of moving droplets include electrical, acoustic, and magnetic fields, but what is unique about tensiophoresis is that it is powered purely by a chemical gradient; hence we refer to it as chemomechanical transduction.  When the surfactant concentration is made higher on one side of the droplet, Marangoni flows drive the droplet toward higher surfactant concentrations. Surfactant-driven Marangoni flow has long been known, and even popularized in the 'soap boat', a children's toy.  However, the inability to precisely control surfactant concentration has left it largely a scientific curiosity, with no substantial applications in biotechnology.\n\nThis proposal was the first to explore how we can use microfluidics to precisely control the surfactant concentrations on the droplet surface in order to achieve precise movements of the droplet.  This enabled two capabilities:\n\n1) Sort droplets by size.  Sorting droplets by size enables one to control the volume of the chemical reactions.  We demonstrated how microfluidic laminar flows can be used to select and sort droplets larger than a specific size.  Our work showed that the size sorting threshold can be easily tuned over a wide range (10-800 um), whereas current methods of droplet sorting require a redesign of the chip to change the tuning threshold.\n\n2) Sorting droplets by surfactant concentration.  Besides controlling the motion of droplets, researchers are also interested in measuring the concentration of biomolecules (for example, proteins) inside a droplet.  Our experiments revealed that proteins impede the tensiophoresis phenomenon because they interfere with surfactants interactions on the surface. Hence, using tensiophoresis, droplets containing proteins can be sorted from those that do not.  This work was first to show that protein concentration can be measured by measuring the velocity of a droplet. \n\nThis work generated a fundamental understanding of the tensiophoresis phenemonon with an analytical model, computational simulations, and experimental data supporting the model and demonstrating the sorting applications.\n\nBroader Impact:  \n\nBeyond the scope of the project?s specific aims, this work made a broader impact in two areas in the scientific and local communities\n\nDroplet tracking software.  As a part of this work, our group developed a droplet tracking software called droplet morphometry and velocimetry (DMV).  This software was the first tool for tracking and measuring droplet parameters in digital videos.  It is able to track more than 20 parameters of interest.  Although we developed it for use in this project, we made it freely available to the scientific community.  DMV is now used by &gt; 75 groups in 16 countries worldwide for applications ranging from droplet microfluidics, single cell analysis, foams, particle tracking, bacteria, spray drying, and drug encapsulation.\n\nEducational outreach. As part of our educational outreach efforts, we conducted a day-long outreach activity at Wayne State University's STEM day 2018, which involved hundreds of local area high school students. Thirty five of these students participated in our hands-on, 1 hour lab demo which exposed the students to elementary and advanced concepts in surface tension driven actuation and the science behind Marangoni flow.  Experiments included the motion of pepper and a soap boat induced by Marangoni flow, and a demonstration of our laboratory experiments.  Students were asked to fill out a short assessment survey, and the results were compiled and provided to NSF.  The majority of students indicated that the activity increased their understanding of surface tension and science careers in general.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/03/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amar Basu"
