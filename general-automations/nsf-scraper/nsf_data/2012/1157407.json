 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networks and Development: Exploring an Emerging Theme\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nDevelopment economics focuses on the economics aspects of improving the quality of lives of less privileged groups regardless of whether they are in advanced economies or less developed economies. Networks are an ideal tool for modeling the micro aspects of such behavior since they can be used to focus of the different levels and types of relations that can exist between individuals in close knit societies. The proposed conference will be the first one to focus entirely on this emerging area of study. Our goal is to bring together senior scholars working in this area to provide an assessment of the current state of knowledge as well as provide directions for the future by setting out a body of open problems. Junior scholars and recent graduates who will benefit from the feedback received as well as from a well defined research agenda. Moreover, an explicit attempt will be made to expose graduate students from LSU and nearby universities in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas to this emerging area of research. Bringing together researchers that use the entire spectrum of methodological tools as well as junior and senior researchers will provide many opportunities for fruitful collaboration. The conference will cover all aspects of the proposed theme: theory, empirical and experimental work.",
