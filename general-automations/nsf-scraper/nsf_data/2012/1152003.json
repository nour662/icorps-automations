 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rochester institute of Technology -- in collaboration with Auburn University, Carnegie Mellon University, and TERC -- proposes the initial stages of a years-long iterative process to develop an evidence-based, pedagogically-sound computing trajectory for students in middle school through early college. The project is based on a novel three-stage model of programming instruction using the Microsoft Kodu, Alice, and Tekkotsu programming frameworks. It will address the questions:\r\n\r\n-- Can the proposed three-stage model for programming instruction, accelerate student progress on mastering computational thinking?\r\n-- Can students develop a deeper understanding of computer science concepts by learning to draw explicit analogies between realizations  \r\n   of the same idea in different settings, i.e., in different software frameworks, or in Kinesthetic Learning Activities like CS   \r\n   Unplugged?\r\n-- How can programming environments be made more accessible to students with disabilities such as visual impairment, deaf/hard of \r\n   hearing, mobility impairment (e.g., cerebral palsy), or learning and cognitive impairment (e.g., autism or ADD)?\r\n\r\nThe last question will be addressed in collaboration with Microsoft FUSE Labs on accessibility enhancements to Kodu, and continuing development of BridgIT, an alternative to Alice designed with accessibility in mind. \r\n\r\nThis planning grant will do preliminary work on these questions, collecting pilot data at a week-long summer camp for students, and a two-day workshop for K-12 teachers. The award will allow the PIs to refine their hypotheses, conduct pilot experiments, deepen their relationships with academic and industry partners, and formulate the detailed research plan needed for the eventual full proposal.",
