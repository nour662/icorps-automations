 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of doctoral students for 12 Ph.D. students in the disciplines of computer science and library and information science in the Doctoral Consortium, June 10, 2012 and the 2012 ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL 2012), to be held at The George Washington University, June 11-14, 2012 (http://www.jcdl2012.info).  Twelve selected students are in the early stages of their dissertation work and include several international students in order to provide breadth in exchanging ideas. The goal of the consortium is to help these students develop their dissertation proposals and research plans through feedback and guidance from prominent professors and experienced practitioners from the field of digital library research and development. The JCDL Doctoral Consortium provides a forum for Ph.D. students to interact with major figures in the digital library community. These leaders, who come from all over the world, exemplify a broad set of expertise, diversity of perspectives, and wealth of knowledge. The consortium provides students with an opportunity to have broad audience and interact intellectually with professionals who would otherwise be difficult to meet with and discuss their ideas. Participating students will be selected on the basis of a paper describing their research and broaden participation and those selected for the consortium will have approximately 40 minutes to present their research plans and receive feedback from the panel. After the consortium the students will revise their papers based on the consortium's feedback and then they will be published in the IEEE Technical Committee on Digital Libraries publication \"TCDL Bulletin\" (http://www.ieee-tcdl.org/mediawiki/TCDL/index.php/IEEE-TCDL). \r\n\r\nThe JCDL 2012 Doctoral Consortium will expose promising Ph.D. students to a larger community, extend their opportunities for intellectual engagement, and encourage scholarly discourse and networking among new entrants into the field. An intended outcome of the workshop is to help shape ongoing and future teaching, research, and development projects in the field of digital libraries by providing wider exposure for the students to innovative ideas which may generate new research questions in the future, and to foster a sense of community among these young researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. The organizers will also take special steps to solicit participation from institutions with underrepresented groups to extend the potential benefits and broaden the horizon of expertise in the field.",
