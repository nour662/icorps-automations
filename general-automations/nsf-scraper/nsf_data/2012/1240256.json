 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research initiation grant will create a partnership between engineering faculty and engineering education researchers to explore development of self-efficacy in electrical engineering students from a broad range of under-represented groups and first generation college students.   The researchers plan to develop a conceptual framework that will let them explore the effect of collaborative learning on self-efficacy then design internal policies for course design and development. \r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project arises from the potential of the project to broadly inform practice that can lead to improved retention of under-represented and first generation students.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by building the capacity of the nation's citizenry for addressing societal challenges through engineering.",
