 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for travel support to approximately 25 U.S. participants to the US-UK Joint Workshop on Arctic Research to be held at Clare College, University of Cambridge, UK in 2012. The workshop will build on significant new investments in arctic research made by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through its Arctic Research Programme. The workshop will enable U.S. investigators to discuss common areas of interest, potential collaborations, and opportunities for sharing logistical resources with their UK colleagues. Participants will be selected by a committee based upon their expected contributions to the subject and their experience in relevant research themes, disciplinary balance and geographical location. U.S. participants are anticipated to be familiar with the goals of the Study of Environmental Arctic Change SEARCH. SEARCH is in the process of developing an updated set of scientific goals for the next five years, which currently include:  improving understanding and prediction of sea ice changes and the consequences for ecosystems, human activities, and climate; understanding the consequences of the loss of shallow permafrost on arctic and global systems; improving predictions of future land?]ice loss and impacts on sea level; and analyzing societal and policy implications of arctic environmental change. NERC is developing a program focused on four linked scientific objectives, detailed in its science plan (http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/programmes/arctic/documents/arctic-science-plan.pdf): understanding and attributing the current rapid changes in the Arctic; quantifying processes leading to Arctic methane and carbon dioxide release; reducing uncertainty in Arctic climate and associated regional biogeochemistry predictions; and assessing the likely risks of submarine hazards associated with rapid Arctic climate change. This proposal will facilitate international collaboration and furtherance of the two national initiatives to study change in the Arctic.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Summary - US-UK joint workshop on Arctic Research\n\nThe research problems inherent to arctic regions are of critical importance with global implications.  The International Polar Year (IPY) solidified international commitment to collaboration in addressing the many gaps in understanding of the complex Arctic system for the mutual benefit of all nations.  Such partnerships permitted more efficient and effective research endeavors through sharing of intellectual capabilities, logistical resources, historical data and capital investments.  Some of these issues include climate change assessment and prediction, marine and terrestrial ecosystem dynamics and transpolar shipping.  Multi-national collaboration enables broader regional validation of algorithms, presenting more economical assessments of models.  International collaboration enables more rapid, and perhaps, more technically correct, solutions to important research questions. \n\nThe UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through its Arctic Research Programme (ARP) has initiated targeted research in the Arctic on Climate Systems, Earth System Science, Biodiversity and Natural Hazards science themes. The US and UK Arctic research programs share many common interests and cooperation will benefit both nations and the entire arctic research community. A workshop organized by the NERC Arctic Office was convened to enable established UK and US investigators to discuss common areas of interest, potential collaborations, and opportunities for sharing logistical resources.
