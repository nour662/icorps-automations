 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit. The objective of this research is to investigate how high-performance silicon integrated circuits can work synergistically with a technology known as large-area electronics to increase the scope of functionality that electronic systems can provide. The proliferation of integrated circuits into our environments means that electronics has the potential to acquire a large number of signals that can be of high importance to us. It also means that electronics must exist unobtrusively in this space. This raises the need for systems that are (1) capable of large-scale physical interfacing through many sensing channels and (2) able to power themselves through embedded energy-harvesting devices, all in a compliant form factor. Large-area electronics is based on low-temperature processing of thin films. This enables diverse materials to be integrated to form a broad range of transducers. It also enables the use of plastic substrates, which can be conformal and physically large. Although transistors are also possible, these have orders of magnitude lower performance and energy efficiency than high-performance silicon integrated circuits. To enable extensive physical interfaces while also retaining high-performance signal-acquisition and computation capabilities, the two technologies must be combined. Such an approach, however, poses substantial scalability challenges. This study investigates methodologies and architectures that leverage devices from both technology domains to achieve highly-scalable and efficient means of exchanging data and power signals across the technology boundaries. \r\n   \r\nBroader impacts. Electronics has demonstrated tremendous value in a wide range of applications. This research lays the ground work for electronics to interface with physical systems on a very large scale. This could lead to transformational systems for applications such as high-resolution sensing skins for monitoring structural health, interactive surfaces for visual computing, etc. In addition to important societal implications, such applications, due to their scale, could become a key driver for the electronics industry. This research develops specific design methodologies that will enable directed technical efforts in conjunction with the increased application scope, helping to focus industry efforts. This research will engage a new generation of engineers, particularly from underrepresented groups, by developing systematic principles for system design, from devices to applications. Both in outreach activities and in university education, the new forms possible for electronic systems will serve to illustrate the diverse applications that engineering has the potential to impact.",
