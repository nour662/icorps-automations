 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies fundamental combinatorial, geometric, and graph-theoretical problems related to the design of wireless networks with directional antennas. The goal is to maximize communication robustness and security while minimizing power consumption and interference. The technical focus is on determining theoretical and algorithmic relationships between antenna parameters (orientation, range, angle), and the structure of the induced communication graph (such as connectivity, fault tolerance, and spanning ratio). \r\n\r\nThis study will generate fresh approaches to geometric algorithms tuned to directional antennas, which must necessarily push beyond known geometric techniques. Building a bridge between theoretical computer science and the burgeoning area of communication networks is a key for scientific advancement, with a potential significant economical impact on the design of wireless communication networks.\r\n\r\nThis project will involve collaborations with under-represented students, who will be fully engaged in designing and testing the necessary simulation software, and will explore conjectures both theoretically and through simulations. This will provide a path for talented under-represented students to enter the world of scientific research, who will then serve as role models for the entire body of computer scientists. Theoretical results will be disseminated broadly in conference publications and journal papers. Simulation software will be made available to researchers and teachers worldwide.",
