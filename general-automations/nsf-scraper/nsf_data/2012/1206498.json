 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclei are among the most complex systems that emerge from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of the strong interaction, and it is of great importance to understand their emergence quantitatively.  This goal is only now beginning to be realized in practice using Lattice QCD and effective field theory methods.  The focus of the proposed project is on obtaining physical predictions for basic nuclear interactions and properties with controlled uncertainties - arising primarily from extrapolation to the physical quark masses and to the continuum limit - accounted for systematically.  Among the nuclear physics questions that this research project is focused on answering are: Which two- and three-baryon systems are bound and what are their binding energies? Are there three-body bound systems involving hyperons?  What are the low-energy hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-nucleon phase shifts, and how will knowledge of these quantities help unravel the role of hyperons and hypernuclei in dense matter such as might occur in the core of neutron stars? \r\n\r\nThis research will help provide a link between long-observed properties of atomic nuclei and the theoretical framework that is believed to provide a basis for these observations, by taking advantages of advances in computing technology and developments in theoretical physics that have only recently made this effort possible.  Graduate student training forms an integral part of this project, and will provide education in theoretical physics as well as forefront computing methods.",
