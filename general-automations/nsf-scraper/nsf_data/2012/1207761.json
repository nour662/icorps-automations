 "awd_abstract_narration": "The formation of the first stars, galaxies, and black holes during what is known as the Cosmic Dawn is the next frontier in observational cosmology.  During this epoch, the intergalactic medium (IGM) was primarily in the form of neutral hydrogen gas, accessible to observations through its redshifted 21 cm line.  Once the first stars formed at a redshift z ~ 30, they produced a background of Lyman-alpha photons that coupled the neutral hydrogen spin temperature to the physical gas temperature in the IGM. This is thought to have caused the 21 cm line to become visible in absorption against the cosmic microwave background (CMB).  Later, X-rays traveling long distances deposited their energy as heat and raised the IGM temperature. This heating drove the average 21 cm signal to rise into emission above the CMB, until the neutral gas was eventually ionized during the epoch of reionization, and no detectable signal remained. The evolution of these absorption and emission features in the early IGM should be evident in cosmic radio spectrum, since redshift maps to frequency for the 21 cm line. \r\n\r\nSignificant observational challenges must be addressed to separate the expected 10-100 mK high-redshift 21 cm signal from the dominant Galactic foreground emission, but Dr. Judd Bowman of the Arizona State University and his collaborators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology propose to overcome these challenges with a spectrometer featuring 10 times improved performance and frequency coverage from 40 to 200 MHz to span the redshift range 6 < z < 30. The new instrument, called EDGES-2, will make use of a new precision calibration method based on a generalization of the classic noise wave propagation model.  Broader impacts of the project include demonstration of this new, high-precision calibration method for wideband systems, which has applications outside of radio astronomy, including to ionospheric study. The project also has a strong focus on providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student training and mentoring in an interdisciplinary environment to learn basic principles of digital signal processing, software design, statistical analysis, model fitting, and astrophysics. \r\n\r\nFunding for the development of the EDGES-2 project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding the origin of the first stars and galaxies in the Universe is one of the great challenges of modern astrophysics.  Low frequency radio observations in the same bands as FM radio and TV broadcasts can address this challenge by charting the properties of hydrogen gas between galaxies more than 13 billion years ago.   The hydrogen gas encodes information about the first stars and galaxies because ultraviolet and X-ray light from early stars is predicted to have heated and ionized the gas.   \n\nThe Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES) developed a low-frequency radio receiver and antenna system capable of achieving high-precision observations of the all-sky radio spectrum.   Measurements from EDGES were used to constrain the properties of the first stars, galaxies, and black holes in the early Universe.  The EDGES experiment was deployed at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in Western Australia (26.72 S, 116.61 E). This location was chosen due to its radio-quiet conditions below 200 MHz with few nearby radio transmitters.  The experiment consisted of two instruments, a high-band instrument sensitive to 100-200 MHz, and a low-band instrument sensitive to 50-100 MHz.  The high-band instrument was able to search for cosmological signals from as early as 330 million years after the Big Bang, while the low-band instrument was able to search for signals from as early as 110 million years after the Big Bang.   EDGES observed the sky as it passed over the experiment from May 2015 through September 2016, generating three gigabytes of data per day.\n\nEDGES observations were able to constrain the duration of the cosmological epoch of reionization&mdash;the period in the history of the Universe when the gas between galaxies became ionized.  The data have provided a unique constraint on this period by ruling out short durations for reionization.  The data are also able to place some of the first constraints on the amount of ultraviolet and X-ray light emitted by early stars and black holes in the Universe.  Results from EDGES will help the astronomical community understand the properties of the first stars and the early history of star formation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/06/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Judd D Bowman"
