 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Christopher Stipe from Seattle University and colleagues Ryan McLaughlin, Frank Shih, Katherine Kuder and J. Wesley will acquire an integrated Raman and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) microscope. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) identification and quantification of geological materials; (b) sediment fingerprinting in support of sediment source determination; (c) characterization of light alloys and biomaterials; (d) analysis of underground coal mining particulate matter for environmental health monitoring; and (e) development of sustainable cement-based materials.\r\n\r\nA Raman-LIBS microscope rapidly acquires both elemental  and molecular chemical information spatially across a sample surface. In Raman-mode, the instrument provides information regarding a sample's chemical composition, structure, phase, and polymorphism; in LIBS-mode, the instrument provides elemental composition. Thus chemical mapping and depth profiling of a wide array of samples can be obtained. The instrument will be used in research by faculty and students in three departments at the institution. It also will be employed in a collaborative study with the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture studying pigments used in Native American art and in a summer immersion program for STEM students from a local high school to learn chemistry and forensic science.",
