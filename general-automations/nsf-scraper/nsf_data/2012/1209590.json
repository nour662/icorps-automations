 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Barbara Allen Wheelden of Ohio University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Altering the properties of plant-based, biodegradable plastics to make them suitable for replacement of petroleum-based food packaging,\" during the summer of 2012 at The Laboratory for Rheology and Processing of Microstructured Materials of Seoul National University in Seoul, Republic of Korea.  The host scientist is Dr. Seung Jong Lee.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research is evidenced by the crossing of boundaries between polymer science, material characterization, and commercial applicability with the goal of optimizing properties of a sustainable plastic material.  The brittleness of polylactide (PLA) hinders its use in packaging applications where flexibility is of particular importance.  By melt blending the bio-plastic with other biodegradable materials (cellulose acetate and triethyl citrate), the flexibility of PLA is being improved without sacrificing its advantageous properties.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

It is a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based plastics because its starting material is an annually renewable resource.  Another attractive characteristic of PLA is its biodegradability. Under composting conditions, PLA breaks down into carbon dioxide and water.  This makes PLA a suitable option for disposable packaging materials, which could reach a composting facility at the end of their useful life.  Although PLA is a stong material in the sense that it exhibits a high tensile modulus, it is very brittle.  This is a major drawback for flexible packaging applications.  The plasticization of PLA with low molecular weight additives and/or tougher, more flexible polymers can modify its properties and promote its use in a wider variety of applications.  \n\nRecently, a popular method of toughening PLA has been melt blending the polymer with natural rubber. Natural rubber is primarily composed of polyisoprene, which comes from latex.  Latex is produced by over 20,000 species of plant, and of these, approximately 2500 species produce latex that is a suitable precursor for natural rubber.  Natural rubber is a thermoplastic elastomer with desirable mechanical properties of high elongation and good impact strength.  Blends of rubber and PLA are immiscible, as PLA is a polar material and rubber is non-polar.  Depending on the desired mechanical properties of the final product, immiscibility can either be utilized or overcome.  It has been shown that a 10% NR/PLA blend increases the elongation at break of the virgin polymer by a factor of 40.  Depending on the desired outcome, an ideal percentage of NR in the PLA matrix exists; due to coalescence of rubber particles hindering the positive effects of the rubber phase, increasing the natural rubber percentage to 20% results in a lower elongation at break than a blend with a smaller percentage of NR.  \n\nPLA and NR blends are immiscible, and the interfacial tension between the two polymers is high. Compatibilizing materials have been shown to reduce interfacial tension between phases in immiscible polymer blends.   Throughout the past 15 years, nanoclays have been extensively researched for the property enhancement that they bring about in polymer/clay nanocomposites as well as the compatibilization effect that they have in polymer blends.  Because of the unique structure of the montmorillonite class of nanoclays and the organic modifications made to the base clay, intercalation and exfoliation of these nanostructures in the polymer matrix can result in enhanced barrier properties, improved strength, and more.\n\nIn this project, we produced PLA/NR blends with NR percentages of 5, 10, and 15%.  The morphology of the blends was studied via microscopy, and the interfacial tension between phases was understood by utilizing rheological measurements.  It was determined that the addition of the nanoclay Cloisite 30B acted as an effective compatibilizer between the PLA and Natural Rubber.  The addition of 3 wt% C30B reduced the domain size of the rubber droplets in the PLA matrix, resulting in better dispersion of the rubber phase, and a tougher blend.  Rheology measurements indicated an increased storage modulus with the addition of nanoclay to the blends. \n\nThis project has laid the framework for deeper study in PLA/NR/MMT blend nanocomposites.  This research is being continued at the Sustainable Energy and Advanced Materials (SEAM) Lab at Ohio University.  Mechanical tests indicate that NR has a significant impact on the flexibility of PLA and thermal studies have elucidated the effect that clay and natural rubber have on PLA's melting, glass transition, and crystalization temperatures.  PLA and NR blends are an all renewable and cost-effective alternative to petroleum based plastics and have the potential to decrease both petroleum dependence and waste ge..."
