The workshop will bring together scientists and historians from around the world to present their research on one of the most important controversies in the history of Twentieth Century biology, the Lysenko Affair: In 1948 the Soviet agronomist T.D. Lysenko received the support of Joseph Stalin and the Central Committee of the Communist Party to ban genetics in the Soviet Union, an edict soon enforced throughout the Communist Bloc.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe workshop will contribute to ongoing research in the fields of history and philosophy of science, environmental history, and the Cold War. It will bring together scholars at every level and across disciplines and strengthen relationships with scholars working in related areas of research. Workshop participants will address a variety of pertinent topics such as the impact and reaction to Lysenkoism in various international contexts, the role of Darwinism and Lamarckism in the Lysenko controversy, and the relationship between Lysenkoism and other topics in the history of Cold War science, the history of biology, and the histories of other scientific disciplines.\r\n\r\nPotential Broader Impacts\r\nThe workshop will be part of a series of activities inaugurating the University of Vienna's graduate program, titled \"The Sciences in Historical, Philosophical and Cultural Context.\" Partnering with a European university will significantly expand the scope of research and foster international ties in the field. The results of the workshop are to be published.",

The meeting brought together thirty-five historians from the United States, Russia, Mexico, France, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Italy, Great Britain, Bulgaria, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, Norway and Poland, to present their research on one of the most important controversies in the history of 20th century biology. Papers covered topics ranging from Lysenko's devastating impact upon genetics in the Soviet Union and allied States such as Bulgaria, Poland and the Czech Republic, but also the reaction in countries such as Japan, France, Italy, the United States and Great Britain. Researchers covered the scientific (e.g., \"Monod, Lysenkoism, and the Concept of Cellular Memory,&rdquo; by Dr. Laurent Loison, Centre Fran&ccedil;ois-Vi&egrave;te, Universit&eacute; de Nantes, France) as well as cultural (e.g. &ldquo;Lysenko, &lsquo;Michurinism&rsquo; and Art at the Moscow Darwin Museum 1930s-1950s&rdquo; by Dr. Patricia Simpson, University of Hertfordshire, England) aspects of \"Lysenkoism.\" Presenters also covered the impact upon education (e.g. &ldquo;The Survival of Mendel in the Lysenkoist Classroom, 1934-1964&rdquo; by Dr.<br />Margaret Peacock, The University of Alabama, USA), the role of journalism (e.g. &ldquo;The Rise of T.
