The initiative will include a \"landscape\" study that will synthesize lessons learned from practice along with education and learning science research about chemistry learning and teaching in informal and formal settings. The overall process will define a set of principles for engaging the public with chemistry and embed these principles into a broad framework that chemists and informal science education professionals could use to identify a set of effective strategies for a given audience and a given educational or communication goal.\r\n \r\nThe guidance and tools resulting from this activity, which is a chemistry-specific case study, should be more generally applicable to science and engineering communications, informal education and outreach.  Findings are also likely to apply to aspects of formal education.",
