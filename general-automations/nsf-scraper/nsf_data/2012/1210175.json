The host scientist is Dr. Ng Bee Chin.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of the research project is shown through the investigation of the connections between the details of linguistic phenomena and larger transnational language and sociocultural ideologies.  This exploration of Singapore English complements existing research on Singapore English by providing a focused analysis of linguistic features and provides a deeper understanding of general speech production and perception phenomena by providing a case study on Singapore English.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntroduction: Project Background, Objectives, and Outcomes \n\n            The NSF EAPSI program in Singapore allowed me to do pre-dissertation fieldwork and research while working and living at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU).  In particular, my research focuses on the social and cultural implications of how a Singaporean uses Singapore English.  Singapore English (SgE) is generally described as a dialect continuum and contains two different varieties of English: Standard Singapore English (SSE), the use of which is associated with sociopolitical prestige and global identity, and Singlish (also, Colloquial Singapore English), which is associated with being uniquely Singaporean and thus, a local and cultural identity.  A previous project (Liu 2011, unpublished) showed that Singaporeans are able to speak SgE variants that occupy various places on the dialect continuum and that the linguistic differences between SSE and Singlish are physically present even at detailed levels of linguistic phenomena.  These two projects specifically examine voice onset time (VOT), a linguistic measure that helps us to categorize different kinds of consonant stops (e.g, sounds like \u00e6p\u00c6, \u00e6t\u00c6, \u00e6k\u00c6, and \u00e6b\u00c6, \u00e6d\u00c6, \u00e6g\u00c6).  Yet, the differences between a single Singaporean\u00c6s version of SSE and Singlish are oftentimes not entirely discrete (the contrasts are not produced consistently, intra-speaker and across speaker).  This introduced an interesting question into my line of research in that, if Singaporeans do not consistently produce versions of SSE and Singlish that are discrete, how do other Singaporeans perceive what kind of variety is being spoken?  Therefore, this current project investigates whether Singaporeans can perceive the differences between varieties of spoken SSE and Singlish, and which linguistic cues are necessary for accurate identification.\n\n            The preliminary data analyses show that while VOT is a variable that shows significant variation during speech production, it does not prove to be a salient cue for Singaporeans if they are given the task of identifying which SgE variety is being spoken.  During the speech perception experiment conducted this summer, Singaporean participants were presented with audio stimuli from recordings of Singaporeans talking to Americans or other Singaporeans.  Participants were then asked to choose the cultural identity of the recorded speaker\u00c6s (i.e., the recorded speaker heard in the audio stimuli) audience.  This methodology was chosen in order that participants do not rely on explicit strategies of identifying some SgE variety but would rely on their subconscious intuition of SgE to make a judgment.  Even so, the data from the speech perception experiment hint that if VOT is presented, isolated without any other linguistic information, is not a salient cue for accurate discrimination.  And while performance improves slightly the more information participants are given, accuracy does not rise anywhere close to 100%.  This evidence implies that SSE and Singlish are not truly discrete varieties of SgE.  Yet, Singaporeans themselves conceptualize SSE and Singlish as two completely separate linguistic entities.  SSE can be used to show power, intelligence, and upward mobility through social strata.  On the other hand, Singlish cannot be eschewed in social situations among friends and is the language of the people.  Thus, this project provided valuable data and of course, further questions that need to be investigated.  In this case, it seems that the ideologies of language, the ideology that SSE is \"better\" than Singlish, is so socially entrenched that it makes the physical differences, or lack of difference, between SSE and Singlish entirely obsolete.  These data can have important implications towards how language should be viewed and can provide valuable insights towards language policy and pedagogy in Singapore.\n\nCultural Experience\n\n            The EAPSI program provided me with th..."
