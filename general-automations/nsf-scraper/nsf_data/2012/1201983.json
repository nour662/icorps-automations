The North Star STEM Alliance, extending the successes of its initial five-year partnership, implements best practices in engaging and retaining URMs studying STEM on 15 Minnesota campuses. Undergraduate research, a featured best practice in retention, will engage more than 375 students, contributing to discovery and innovation across the spectrum of STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nBy May, 2017, the more than 3,200 URM STEM graduates influenced and supported by the North Star STEM Alliance will enter the work force or graduate school, diversifying the academy, corporations, and professional organizations. Many of the Alliance alumni remain in Minnesota, contributing to a stronger Minnesota economy and the nation?s competitiveness in the global economy.",

I have met so many amazing people and learned so much from the activities that I have completed as a part of the program. I came to campus with many apprehensions and I am thankful that the North Star STEM Alliance has given me a sense of belonging and provided me with great opportunities along the way. --University of Minnesota Twin Cities student\n\nThe North Star STEM Alliance is Minnesota's Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP), one of more than forty across the nation.  As a Mid-level Alliance, the North Star STEM Alliance was a partnership of 14 Minnesota colleges and universities and three community organizations committed to supporting underrepresented minority students earning bachelor's degrees in STEM -- science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

Community partners included the Minnesota Education Equity Partnership, Minnesota High Tech Association, and the Science Museum of Minnesota.  We worked together as a partnership to share effective practices and leverage opportunities for our students. We also fostered change toward greater diversity and inclusion on our campuses leading toward greater overall success of underrepresented students in STEM. \n\nGoals: 1) Double the number of underrepresented minority students receiving STEM bachelor's degrees. 2)  Develop an alliance of collegiate institutions and community organizations working toward increasing the likelihood of success of underrepresented students working toward the bachelor's degree.  3)  Foster institutional change toward greater diversity and inclusion on partner campuses.\n\nOutcomes of the Mid-level Alliance:  The Alliance achieved 466 graduates by May 2017 on the way toward our second doubling goal of 544 graduates.

They learn alongside faculty and graduate students and travel to national scientific conferences to present research results.  This best practice is regarded as the most influential retention program for minority undergraduate students. A total of 378 students participated in undergraduate research during the Mid-level Alliance. \n\n2)       Helping students associate with other students from cultural minorities majoring in STEM reduces the isolation they feel in classrooms and laboratories in predominately white institutions.  They feel more comfortable and accepted among students of their own culture.  The Alliance helps cohorts and communities form in departments, colleges, and across partner institutions.\n\n3)       Mentoring, like coaching, provides one-on-one career guidance and professional development by one who is more advanced in the STEM career.  This mentoring may come from a student farther along in coursework, a faculty member, or STEM professional in government or industry.  In 2016-17, 186 faculty, staff and graduate students across partner institutions mentored Alliance students.  Peer mentoring is a strong component on most partner programs.\n\n4)       Academic support consists of one-on-one tutoring, group study, locating study partners, supplemental instruction, connecting students to campus study resources, and workshops on academic and research skills.\n\n5)       Professional and career development gives students experience in presenting oneself professionally, networking effectively, interviewing, and setting career goals.  Students also become accustomed to their new professional STEM communities through opportunities to meet STEM professionals and attend national conferences. A total of 709 Alliance students attended 27 national and regional conferences.\n\nDuring 2012-17, student engagement, participation in research, and the number of graduates rose steadily due to the North Star STEM Alliance's relationships with underrepresented students.
