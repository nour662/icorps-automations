 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predation is one of the most important factors affecting the size of wildlife populations.  To manage and conserve wildlife populations, we must understand how predation limits prey numbers  For many decades,  research on predation has focused solely on the effect of direct killing, but recent studies show that the costs of avoiding predation (or 'risk effects') can also have strong effects.  In particular, antipredator behavior can lead to changes in nutrition that reduce reproduction, and it is easy to mistakenly attribute such responses to factors other than predation (for example, limitation by the availability of food).  This study will (1) measure a broad set of antipredator responses to variation in the risk of predation for a broad set of species, (2) measure the nutritional costs of these responses, and (3) test for effects on reproduction.  By examining the responses of several prey species under varying environmental conditions, the study will identify factors that control the magnitude of predation risk effects. Overall, this study will advance our understanding of the ways that large carnivores affect populations of ungulates.  Because large-carnivore ungulate systems are in decline worldwide, the results will be of immediate value for conservation and management. This project will also train undergraduate and graduate students in animal behavior and conservation research and provide international experience for those students who will be working at the research area in Zambia.  Due to the international component the project is jointly supported by the Behavioral Systems Cluster and the Office for International Science and Engineering Global Venture Fund.",
