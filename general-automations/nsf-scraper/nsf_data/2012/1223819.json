 "awd_abstract_narration": "This International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program in the Division of Chemistry supports collaborative work by Professor Peter J. Tonge of Stony Brook University and Professor Stephen R. Meech of the University of East Anglia in the UK, who is supported by the EPSRC, to carry out fundamental studies on photoreceptor function. Photoreceptors are proteins that have evolved specifically to convert light energy into structural change, and as such serve as prototypes for light driven molecular and biomolecular devices. The team at the University of East Anglia investigates \"how\" the protein environment of the photoreceptor modulates the excited state chemistry of the embedded chromophore on the ultrafast timescale. The principal investigator at Stony Brook University and his international team study how light absorption by the photoreceptor chromophore is coupled to structural changes in the protein that lead ultimately to signaling. Investigation of the mechanism of photoreceptor function in real time will provide a picture of a photoreceptor protein in action and requires measurements over many decades in time from femtoseconds to milliseconds. Unraveling the protein reorganization which follows from the primary light absorption process will underpin the development of optical devices for controlling genetic responses in vivo and the application of optogenetics to problems at the intersection of physics, chemistry and biology.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposal range from the training of students at the interface between chemical dynamics and chemical biology, to a fundamental understanding of how photoproteins control and respond to light absorption which is central to such diverse biological processes such as vision, circadian rhythms and DNA repair. Students at Stony Brook University will make multiple trips each year to the UK to visit the UK collaborator and also to collect ultrafast spectroscopic data at the Research Complex at Harwell which is a key component of this ICC project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe ability of organisms such as bacteria, plants and mammals to sense and respond to light is a fundamental aspect of life on earth.  The process of sensing light is performed by specialized colored proteins called photoreceptors that interact with the light and send signals to the organism.  Photoreceptors thus play a key role in processes such as photosynthesis - the conversion of light energy into food, visual transduction &ndash; the ability to see, and circadian rhythms &ndash; our biological \u00e6clock\u00c6 that tells us when to sleep. \n\nPhotoreceptors are fascinating biological devices and there is intense interest in understanding how they work so that we can create photoreceptors with new functions &ndash; for example so that we can use light to turn genes on and off (a field called optogenetics).  In our work funded by the National Science Foundation we have sent students from our lab in Stony Brook to work with groups in the UK, at the University of East Anglia and at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL).  These visits enhance the ability of the students to work productively with scientists from different disciplines, and have given them the outstanding opportunity to be trained at the interface between physics, chemistry and biology, so that they can meet the challenge of deploying advanced chemical physics methods to dissect complex systems at the interface of chemistry and biology.  Our lab at Stony Brook has also hosted undergraduates and high school students (Figure 1), the latter co-mentored during the summer by a science teacher from a local high school.  Last year the Society for Science &amp; the Public published interviews with the high school students.  Collectively, this rich training environment underpins the broader impacts of the funded research.\n\nOne of the key challenges we have tackled in our research program has been to understand exactly how photoreceptors convert the energy in a photon of light into structural changes that lead to activation of the system.  This current gap in knowledge is an important barrier for engineering photoreceptors for novel functions.  In particular, we need to understand how the almost instantaneous absorption of a photon of light, which happens very, very quickly, leads to  changes in the photoreceptor protein that occur at least 10 decades of time (10,000,000,000-times) more slowly. \n\nSignificantly, we have been able to tackle this problem through access to an instrument at RAL (Figure 2) which can make measurements over 10 decades of time.  This time-resolved multiple-probe spectroscopy (TRMPS) technique has been used to study photoreceptors from bacteria and plants.  TRMPS looks at how the vibrational spectrum of the photoreceptor changes after it is triggered by light (Figure 3).  The vibrational spectrum is a picture of the vibrations in the photoreceptor, and the TRMPS method tells us which parts of the photoreceptor are moving and when they move after light irradiaton &ndash; i.e. this method captures photoreceptor activation through time and space.  We observe that some changes in the protein occur very fast indeed (in 0.0000000000001 s) while other may take millisecond or seconds. Using this method, together with our ability to selectively alter specific parts of the photoreceptor, we have developed a detailed understanding of photoreceptor function including the role that specific parts of the receptor play in transmitting the signal through the protein, and whether or not the initial step in the process involves transfer of an electron to the part of the receptor where the light first interacts with the photoreceptor (Figure 3).  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter J Tonge"
