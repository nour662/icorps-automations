 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2012 V. M. Goldschmidt Conference in Montreal, Canada will provide an excellent opportunity for young geochemists to share their research with the scientific community, learn about cutting edge research taking place around the world, and interact with senior scientists specializing in their specific realm of interest. Thematic issues to be addressed at the conference span a broad range of sub-disciplines in low- and high- temperature geochemistry, including evolution of the early Earth, the solar system, climate, ocean chemistry, and continental crust; formation, evolution and dynamics of deep earth materials; subduction, the mantle wedge and arc volcanism; earth surface processes; interfacial geochemistry; earth resources; atmospheric aerosols; global geochemical cycles; environmental impacts of human activities; computational geochemistry; analytical techniques; geomicrobiology; evolution of life and astrobiology; geochemical kinetics; medical geochemistry; geoengineering and remediation; and hydrogeochemistry and the water cycle. In addition to oral and poster presentation sessions, students will have an opportunity to participate in field trips as well as short courses. This proposal puts forth a method for fairly selecting and distributing travel support funds to the most qualified student applicants, to ensure that 30 or more have an opportunity to benefit from all the resources to be assembled at the conference. In addition to the funding requested from NSF, the Geochemical Society will contribute $10,000, bringing the total number of student opportunities to 40.\r\n\r\nInternational scientific meetings are the primary networking outlet for researchers of all experience levels. For students, these meetings are often the first opportunity to interact with members of the international scientific community. As the premier international geochemical conference, the Goldschmidt Conference plays a critical role in introducing young researchers to the world of geochemistry beyond their home institutions. The lingering effects of such an international learning and networking experience can be life changing for a student struggling to gain a foothold in the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThe proposed student travel support program will enable the best and brightest students from the US and US Territories, students who might otherwise be unable to attend due to financial constraints at their home institutions, to benefit from all the advantages this meeting has to offer at this turning point in their respective careers. Every effort will be made to encourage women, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities to apply for funding, and to ensure, as much as possible, that the full range of demographic diversity sampled by today's geosciences graduate student community is represented among the awardees. Encouraging participation by underrepresented groups in international events such as the Goldschmidt Conference will increase the diversity of the core group of senior geoscientists in the years to come.",
