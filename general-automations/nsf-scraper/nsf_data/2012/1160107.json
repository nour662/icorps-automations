The project will involve interdisciplinary student teams (e.g. biomedical, mechanical and or electrical engineering, clinician/health care providers, and clients/patients) who will design/augment and construct custom devices that will improve quality of life and self-sufficiency for persons with mobility disabilities. Special emphasis will be placed on selecting clients who require solutions that may otherwise be cost prohibitive or unavailable. Existing freshman and concurrent senior design course sequences in UoM's Biomedical, Mechanical and Electrical & Computer Engineering departments, coupled with existing, robust collaborative activities with regional orthopaedic companies and clinical/health care provider groups, provide a novel and unique environment for the proposed activities. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Project Activity:\r\nThis project will provide custom, student-designed/engineered devices to persons with mobility disabilities in order to improve their quality of life and self-sufficiency. Activities will enhance engineering student education through multi-disciplinary, meaningful real-world and real-need design projects. The design projects and internships will provide education and learning activities that are not normally part of the engineering curriculum and promote careers in rehabilitation and assistive technology disciplines to advance solutions to effectively address the needs of persons with disabilities. There is an important and compelling need to assist individuals with mobility disabilities to reach their maximum potential for enjoyable and productive lives, both for their individual senses of well-being and for well-being of society.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of the Proposed Activity:\r\nThe proposed design projects will provide custom devices to individuals suffering from loss of mobility due to disease or injury that are cost-prohibitive for the client or otherwise unavailable. The project will provide an important community service to persons with mobility disabilities that will improve quality of life and self-sufficiency. We will increase student and community awareness of issues facing individuals with mobility disabilities through presentations and publication of papers regarding developed designs at professional meetings and through university outreach and promotional activities, so project ideas may be easily replicated elsewhere. This project will also encourage students to pursue engineering and professional careers related to rehabilitation and assistive technologies. In particular, participation by students from traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and African Americans, will be encouraged and promoted through MemphiSTEP an NSF STEM Talent Expansion Program, Girls Experiencing Engineering summer programs, and from among University's existing, high percentage of undergraduate students from these underserved student populations.&#56256;&#56323;",

Overall, this project involved 78 students (approximately 25% women and 22% African-American or other ethnic minority) in 17 design projects, including several design projects specific for freshmen level biomedical engineering students or as biomedical engineering student honors projects. Projects ranged from adaptions to an electric wheelchair for a university student to prevent shorting-out of chair power controls due to rain, adaptive cup holders for motorized wheel chairs, a brace to control hypertonicity of muscles in pediatric patients, motorized computer monitor positioner for a quadriplegic, stand-assist-device for client with neuropathy, customization of electric toy cars for children with limited mobility, assistive transport devices for mechanically ventilated pediatric patients, a book transport system for university student with impaired muscle control, and devices to assist in daily activities like shaving/grooming, dressing and writing for clients with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. These design projects were developed with project partners; The University of Memphis Student Disability Services, LeBonheur Early Intervention and Development program, UTHSC-Memphis Department of Physical Therapy, Mid-South Access Center for Technology and The Campbell Orthopedic Clinic. All design projects involved multi-disciplinary teams involving physical therapists, assistive technology/disability professionals, and engineers. Several of the teams also included students in mechanical, electrical or engineering technology to address design challenges. This cross-disciplinary interaction provided an important learning activity that is not part of the traditional engineering curriculum since students had to learn to communicate effectively using different formats and terminology that are specific to the different disciplines. This is important communication learning experience since solving clinical problems requires multi-disciplinary approaches and also is important to expressing how designs will work to meet clinical needs across the different groups. In total, 14 design projects were completed and delivered to clients or sponsoring partner groups for use free of charge. These projects provided students real world, real need design and construction experience since they had to design and or customize a device for each client&rsquo;s specific mobility challenge and witnessed the impact and success, or short-coming of their designs for an actual client.
