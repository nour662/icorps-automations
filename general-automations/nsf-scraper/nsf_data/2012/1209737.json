  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe focus of this project was to investigate lubricating coatings for small-scale applications.  The goal of research in this field is to create tough coatings that lubricate sliding surfaces and do not wear over a long period of time.  The field that studies lubrication and wear is sometimes known as \u00e6tribology\u00c6.\n\nSpecifically, this project looked at using a composite coating.  In this case, that coating consists of a strong material combined with a slippery material.  Each one of these materials acts as a poor coating by itself.  The strong coating will bind to another material well but does not lubricate.  Conversely, the slippery material lubricates well but is worn away quickly.  Combining the two materials allows the strong material to anchor the slippery material and give a lubricating and resilient coating.\n\nChallenges in this project are related to creating a stable coating that benefits from the advantages of each individual material.  Fundamental interactions between the two materials must be understood as well.  If the materials do not mix with each other then two distinct coatings might be created instead of a mixed composite.  This would be bad because it doesn\u00c6t take advantage of the unique aspects of each material.  Understanding how the two materials interact chemically is important to creating a useful coating.\n\nPreliminary results show that the composite coating acts well to lubricate sliding surfaces and decrease wear.  Further research is being conducted to determine the mechanism for this lubrication.\n\nSuccessfully developing coatings that lubricate and eliminate wear could lead to many useful applications.  These coatings could be specifically useful for an area known as microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS.  MEMS devices can consist of gears or switches that are smaller than 100 micrometers, or less than the width of a human hair.  Currently the devices wear too quickly to be economically feasible, but creating lubricating and wear-resistant coatings would open up many areas of use in electronics or miniaturization.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anthony Barthel"
