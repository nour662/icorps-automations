 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to cover registration costs for graduate students and postdoctoral attendees, as well as for local reporters and undergraduates to attend the 10th International Congress of Neuroethology (ICN), to be held on August 5-10, 2012, at the University of Maryland in College Park. Topics to be covered at the meeting include sensory processing and perception, multisensory signaling, locomotion and motor control, behavioral endocrinology, and genetic control of behavior. Some sessions will highlight new technologies, such as automated analysis of complex behaviors emerging in animal groups and optogenetics. The program is designed to incorporate discussion of brain function at different levels of analysis (from biophysics to field behavior) using a wide range of tools and techniques (including those drawn from physics, mathematics, signal processing, molecular biology, genomics, field observations, psychophysics, and neurophysiology) and examined in a diversity of species, both vertebrate and invertebrate. These different approaches are bound together by a common fundamental goal:  to uncover neural, computational, and design solutions to natural biological problems that, once identified, can more easily pursued in other species or implemented technologically.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nFinancial support from the National Science Foundation made it possible for 40 US undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to participate in the International Congress in Neuroethology (ICN), an interdisciplinary, international conference, hosted in 2012 at the University of Maryland, College Park.  The ICN is the major scientific meeting of the International Society for Neuroethology (ISN), and at the 2012 meeting approximately 600 people were in attendance from all over the world.  \n\nScientists working on research in the field of Neuroethology aim to understand the brain mechanisms regulating complex, species-specific behaviors in a range of animal species.  The emphasis is on uncovering neural, computational, and design solutions to biological problems of sensory processing, motor output, and integrative functions that, once identified, can be more easily pursued in other species or implemented technologically. \n\nThe International Congress in Neuroethology (ICN) has consistently been an outstanding venue in which students and scientists at different professional ranks can meet to discuss research, theory, and techniques in Neuroethology.  Its interdisciplinary and collaborative focus makes ICN a critical scientific platform for advancing our knowledge of brain function and behavior in a wide variety of animal species.   \n\nThe 2012 Congress featured eight plenary lectures, two special evening lectures, an invited \"Young Investigator Symposium,\" and an invited \"Roots of Neuroethology\" symposium, all in separate, non-overlapping time slots.   The four speakers in the Young Investigator Symposium were recipients of the Society's Young Investigator Prize for doctoral graduate students and early post-doctoral fellows with outstanding promise and potential to make significant research contributions to Neuroethology.  In addition, 15 contributed symposia, each consisting of four speakers, were presented; four of these symposia were limited to presentations by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, or beginning assistant professors.  Contributed symposia were scheduled in simultaneous groups of three.  Two formal poster sessions, each lasting 24 hours, were scheduled; in total, 389 posters were presented.\n\nTopics covered included sensory processing and perception, echolocation and electrolocation, sensorimotor integration, locomotion and motor control, orientation and navigation, behavioral endocrinology, genetic control of behavior, learning and motivation, and cognition.  New technologies such as automated analysis of complex behaviors emerging in animal groups, genomics, and robotics were also presented.\n\nThis NSF-supported ICN provided the opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as established scientists, to learn and discuss the latest discoveries in the field of Neuroethology.  The conference also served the important role of enabling scientific exchange among researchers around the world.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/08/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cynthia F Moss"
