 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award aims to increase our understanding about the power of quantum computers.  The goal is to determine which problems have efficient quantum algorithms and which do not.  One source of problems relates to the simulation of quantum mechanical systems.  Another direction is determining which cryptosystems are secure against quantum computers.  The most commonly used cryptosystems, such as systems based on RSA and elliptic curves, can be broken by quantum computers and an important question is to determine which systems to use instead.  This question involves both understanding which problems are hard for quantum computers as well as how to design secure protocols.\r\n\r\nThe PI and his graduate students will consider three types of problems.  The first comes from Hamiltonian complexity, which addresses computing properties of physical systems.  Depending on the setup, these systems range from being solvable classically to being very hard even for quantum computers. The second set of problems comes from proposals for quantum-resistant cryptography using the Learning With Errors problem.  The PI will study the recent assumptions that have been made to make these systems more efficient to see if they are secure against quantum computers.  The third set of questions involves determining when the security arguments work for classical protocols in the presence of quantum computers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project aimed to increase our understanding of the power of quantum computers.  One goal was to determine which problems have efficient quantum algorithms, and a second equally important goal was to determine which problems quantum computers cannot solve.  One source of problems are problems related to the dihedral hidden subgroup problem.  This has applications to the security of some lattice-based cryptosystems.  The most commonly used cryptosystems, such as systems based on RSA and elliptic curves, can be broken by quantum computers and an important question is to determine which systems to use instead.  This question involves both understanding which problems are hard for quantum computers as well as how to design secure protocols.\n\nWe found a quantum algorithm for computing the unit group of an arbitrary degree number field.  The existence of a quantum algorithm for this problem had been open for more than ten years.  This provides a new example of an exponential speedup that can be achieved by a quantum computer compared to the best classical algorithm.  It also led to the first quantum algorithm that can break some special cases of lattice-based cryptosystems.  These types of cryptosystems are one of the main proposals for quantum-resistant cryptography.  Their general security is still an open question, but this provides the first evidence that they may not be secure.\n\nAnother main result is that we found some weak instances of the polynomial-LWE problem.  We show that for some number fields, there is an attack on the polynomial version of the ring-LWE problem.  For general number fields we articulated the relevant properties and proved security reductions for number fields with those properties.  \n\nThe third result gives a better understanding of the connection between subset sum and the dihedral hidden coset problem.  The dihedral hidden coset problem provides one possible pathway for finding a quantum algorithm for problems on general lattices.  It was known to be at least as hard as random subset sum with a density that might not be hard to solve.  In this work we computed a basis for the coset space, which gave an exact characterization of the basis states in terms of subset sum.  We then showed that if an efficiently implementable unitary transform exists that uses that basis in certain restricted ways, then that unitary can also be used to solve random collision, and in some cases, random subset sum for the hardest density range.  This gives some more evidence that the dihedral coset problem may be computationally difficult.\n\nTwo Ph.D. students were trained on this grant.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sean J Hallgren"
