 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a new Computing Research Infrastructure (CRI) project focused on power- and thermal-aware computing at Wayne State University.  PORTAL (the proposed POweR and Thermal Aware computing Laboratory) will support a broad range of research on software-controlled power and thermal optimization of both general-purpose and embedded systems, by providing: 1) a diverse set of hardware test beds, ranging from server-level processors to smart phones; 2) precision power and thermal measurement capabilities permitting the development and verification of accurate power and thermal models; 3) battery power-dissipation measurement capabilities for investigation of systems in a compact environment; and 4) performance evaluation data collection mechanisms used in both research and education settings.\r\n\r\nPower and heat management are critical concerns for sustainable computing.  Progress in this area benefits society through reduction in energy usage and enablement of new portable electronic devices with reduced battery lifetime limitations.  The project improves educational opportunities and work-force development at Wayne State University through development of new courses on power and thermal effects in computing, improving coverage of energy and power dissipation in existing courses within the core curriculum, and providing hands-on experience for experimentation by students.  The investigators are committed to making use of the new facilities in their efforts to involve more female and under-represented minority students in computing systems research, and their outreach activities to K-12 students.",

In this project, we developed an experimental infrastructure called POweR and Thermal Aware computing Laboratory (PORTAL) that captures the challenges and complexities of power and thermal-aware analysis of modern computer systems, including software power behavior analysis on different platforms and thermal effects under real-time system constrains.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  In combining theoretical results and experimental properties of modern computer systems? power dissipation and thermal effects, PORTAL has made important, novel contributions to the infrastructure for power and thermal research.  In particular, PORTAL has contributed the following major infrastructure:\n\nA suite of computing testbed architectures ranging from server-level multicore processors, large-scale storage systems, smart phones, and embedded boards: the range of architectures permits the exploration of software/power interaction upon PORTAL at different scales of computing.\nAn array of power/thermal instrumentation and data acquisition equipment:  PORTAL includes sophisticated programmable, modular data acquisition devices (e.g., National Instruments PXI), thermal-imaging cameras, and numerous other voltage/thermal/energy instrumentation tools. These instruments and tools permit fine-grained measurement of power/thermal behavior to be collected while executing different power-aware software.\nThermal/power environmental controllers: to simulate dynamic environments where environmental temperature or available power can change, PORTAL includes a thermal forcing system which permits fine-grained control of a system?s environmental temperature and programmable power sources which permit different operating voltages/currents.\nAutomated software controllers for PORTAL experiments: to enable the development of long-running experiments, we developed a set of specialized software controllers that are able to change the operating environment temperature or power (based on the desired experiment scenario) and collect the power/thermal data from the system.   These software controllers permit researchers to develop long-running experiments to observe a software systems interaction with the environment.\n\n\nPORTAL has enabled the following research by providing an infrastructure to explore power/thermal dissipation under a variety of software techniques:\n\nWe have developed a range of support software for thermal and power aware analysis and system design. For power analysis and design, we have developed four software tools: SPAN, Safari, BatteryExtender, and Bugu. SPAN is a software power analyzer for multicore systems that maps power dissipation to software blocks at runtime. Safari is a tool that performs function-level analysis on software to determine a power profile for each function call in a software system to be used by software system designers. Bugu is software tool that enables energy-saving for mobile applications.  BatteryExtender is an adaptive user-guided tool for power management of mobile devices.\nWe developed a comprehensive control-theory-based framework for designing real-time, embedded systems where the system?s timing behavior (e.g., meeting computational deadlines) can predictably adapt with changes in environmental temperature.  This research is fundamentally important for systems that have passive thermal management such as slowing down or turning off the processor to dissipate heat.\nWe also develop operating system-level scheduling techniques and associated analysis that minimizes the overhead (e.g., cache misses) of executing real-time applications and improves the \"schedulability\" of the system (i.e., the ability to meet computational deadlines).  These improvements enable a reduction in energy consumption for real-time, embedded systems. \n\n\nBroader Impacts:  The principal investigators and their students for this project have presented their research at numerous universities and research institutions, conferences, workshops, and provided demonstrations of PORTAL to visitors (including high school students).  Ten Ph.D. students have participated in this project over four years, including two female Ph.D. students.  One of our female Ph.D. students received a best paper nomination for her work on this project.  Four Ph.D. dissertations have resulted from this project, and these students have gone on to obtain positions at academic institutions (Hangzhou Dianzi University) and industry (e.g., GM, Intel, and Amazon).  Furthermore, this project supported and served as the basis for an undergraduate honor?s thesis; the student has joined WSU CS Ph.D. program supported by a fellowship.  Visiting researchers and Ph.D. have also utilized PORTAL for their research on thermal- and energy-aware computing systems research.  PORTAL has also served as a testbed for course projects for graduate and undergraduate level courses.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/28/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nathan W Fisher"
