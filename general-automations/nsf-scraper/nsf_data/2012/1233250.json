 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Suppes, Galen\r\nProposal Number: 1233250\r\nInstitution: University of Missouri-Columbia\r\nTitle: Radically New Convection Battery for a Sustainable Transportation Future\r\n\r\nAn increase in the battery capacity is needed for transportation applications. The PI has come with an innovative convection battery with a new design that can achieve significantly high ion fluxes through the separators between the electrodes.  A convection battery uses a pump to circulate a liquid electrolyte directly through permeable electrodes and the permeable membrane that separates the electrodes.  It is a new approach to battery design; more specifically, no evidence of previous batteries utilizing membranes permeable to fluid flow has been located.  The proposed work aims to simultaneously improve performance and decrease costs for batteries sized at >2kWh for transportation and stationary applications.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research include (a) synthesis and characterization of materials; (b) assembly and testing of convection batteries; (c) extending convection battery testing to measure voltage profiles using a custom-fabricated reference cell; (d) evaluating/modeling  and  evolving  theories  describing  the  battery  performance;  and  (e)  adopting alternative separators, supports, electrolytes, and chemistries based on opportunity and need.  A particularly intriguing development in this research is the identification of how separator materials have a major impact on counter-ion counter-diffusion.  Theories related to dimensionless diffusivity, nearest molecular neighbor separation, and ion hopping rate constants appear to be applicable. The modeling studies are designed to improve the understanding of parameters (such as these) that impact the performance of the convection battery and to improve the understanding of how material properties impact dimensionless diffusivity for counter-ions undergoing counter-diffusion.\r\n\r\nThe convection battery can substantially eliminate the reliance of the US on imported oil and will advance sustainable electrical power production.  Extensions  of  both  proposed modeling  and  experimental  research  on  batteries  will  be  used  in undergraduate and graduate courses. The laboratories of the PI will actively recruit and foster undergraduate researchers including minorities and females who are encouraged to pursue graduate degrees.  The undergraduate research program is a key part of the program and the equipment and resources of this effort will enhance that infrastructure.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe convection battery is a new type of battery with flow of liquid electrolyte through and between the battery?s electrodes.  The convection battery will:  a) substantially reduce the battery weight, b) substantially reduce charge times, c) remove battery waste heat faster and better, and d) provide a robust means to avoid lithium battery fire and explosion through built-in pressure release with quenching of reactions through controlled discharge of electrolyte.  Combined, these allow for the most ambitious goals for battery electric vehicles and battery backup of grid power to be attained in a defined path; faster and better than alternatives. \n\n \n\nThe outcomes of this project are documented in 1 paper submitted for publication [1], 8 published papers [2-9], 2 PhD dissertations [10-11], and 2 MS theses [12-13].  The outcomes of this project provided for substantial progress toward achieving the potential of the convection battery.  These outcomes include:\n\n \n\nOutcome 1 &ndash; Demonstrate Reduced the Weight of Rechargeable Lithium Batteries by Eliminating Dendrite Formation for Metal Electrodes:  An 80% reduction in the weight of the anode of rechargeable lithium batteries can be attained by storing the lithium as a metal rather than as a cation in what is referred to as an \"intercalation matrix\" (Fig1).  In the absence of convective flow, lithium forms needle-like crystals (called dendrites, Fig2) that can pierce the separator between electrodes and cause short-circuit.  Flow of electrolyte eliminates the formation of dendrites by eliminate the high concentration of dissolved lithium cations.  Detailed discussions are in the paper by Dornbusch et al [3].\n\n \n\nOutcome 2 &ndash; Demonstrate Reduced Charge Times:  Flow of electrolyte allows charging to occur faster much like the fan that circulates air through the cooling coils of an air conditioner cause a room to cool faster (Fig3).  The theory, modeling [5] (Fig4), and experimental [9] verification were achieved as part of this project. \n\n \n\nOutcome 3 &ndash; Complete Approach Including Heat Removals and Improved Safety:  Initially, the convection battery was performed to attain faster charge (and discharge times) in batteries.  A focus on this technology over a five-year period has identified that advantages associated with heat removal and improved safety rival the advantages associated with advantages of faster rates and eliminated of dendrite formation.\n\n \n\nOutcome 4 &ndash; Demonstrate Cheaper Materials for Batteries:  Lithium-sulfur chemistry that is both among the least expensive and among the highest energy density.  A problem associated with fade of capacity limits applications for rechargeable batteries.  The fade problem increased in the convection battery.  Dornbusch and Suppes [1] have identified an approach that solves this fade problem, and the convection battery turned out to be one of the most precise and efficient test platforms.\n\n \n\nOutcome 5 &ndash; Initiate Separator Materials Development:  Flow of electrolyte in a convection battery can lead to the separator between an anode and its counter-cathode being the limiting factor in performance.  A theory (Fig5) on how to reduce this barrier along with development of first generation materials to provide a solution was performed [2].\n\n \n\nDornbusch, D., G. J.
