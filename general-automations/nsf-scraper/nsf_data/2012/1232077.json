 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to conduct experimental investigation of novel nonlinear material and\r\nwaveguide designs and to develop a compact, integrated photonic device platform for nonlinear optical\r\ndevices operating in the mid-infrared spectral region. There is a current dearth of nonlinear optical\r\ndevices in the mid-infrared and the proposed research program aims to fill this void.\r\nThe intellectual merits are: (1) novel device architecture for slow light propagation with low loss and (2)\r\nnew tunable light sources and amplifiers for the mid-infrared frequency region. The slow light devices\r\nare based on photonic crystals to enable dispersion engineering necessary for slow light but has radically\r\ndifferent designs to circumvent the fundamental limits imposed by scattering loss. Additionally, the\r\ndevices will be implemented in a chalcogenide material system, with high nonlinearity and Raman gain,\r\nlong infrared transparency, and a high glass transition temperature.\r\nThe broader impacts are many. First, the proposed work will broadly impact the applied physics and\r\nmaterials science world by providing a new class of devices based on nonlinear-enhancement from slow\r\nlight. The capability of ultralow threshold for nonlinearities will open a wide application space for the use\r\nof\r\ndevices with standard, low cost lasers. The potential to demonstrate a low-threshold nonlinear optical\r\ndevice in the mid-infrared will be transformative for applications in sensing, spectroscopy,\r\ncommunications, medicine and more. The project is also designed to integrate research with education at\r\nboth undergraduate and graduate levels, attract underrepresented minority students, and offer outreach to\r\ngeneral public.",
