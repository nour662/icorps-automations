The project is conducting a series of community-based events to engage Hawai'ian middle, high school, and community college students and their families in hands-on, ocean-themed science activities that leverage research data from the NSF-funded Center for Microbial Oceanography, Research and Education (C-MORE) and Hawai'ian Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, as well as state-of-the-art technologies from the University of Hawai'i, Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology and Coastal Geology.  Additional objectives of the project are focused on showcasing a variety of culturally-relevant geoscience careers and fostering collaborations with Hawaii's geoscience-related businesses.  The project is expected to impact 3,600 participants, 240 volunteers, and approximately 120 educators.",

Remarkably, 31% of SOEST?s Native Hawaiian students were recruited from this summer bridge program.  This is an important contribution to broadening participation in the geosciences in Hawaii and suggests that investing in community college &ndash; university bridge programs is a wise investment.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barbara C Bruno"
