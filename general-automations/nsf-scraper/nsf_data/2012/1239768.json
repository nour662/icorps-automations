 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through efforts of TCUP I and II, the foundation is now in place at Chief Dull Knife\r\nCollege for taking the next steps in conducting more sophisticated and nuanced research that will\r\nassess the impact of the expanded and improved learning opportunities offered to CDKC\r\nstudents in math and science. This research proposal responds to the call by Trowler (2005) for\r\nimproved research on higher education reforms that reveal how specific innovations relate to\r\nparticular teaching and learning contexts. The development of data sources and instruments for\r\ndocumenting student progress and for TCUP project assessments has created a unique\r\nopportunity now to conduct research that has not been possible before. The research capability\r\ndevelopment will include the creation of a database that incorporates and coordinates all the\r\nexisting data sources and the establishment of procedures for accessing relevant data to address\r\nresearch questions about STEM programs and their impacts on students. Database development\r\nwill draw on multiple data sources and will allow a wide range of questions to be addressed with a\r\nvariety of statistical techniques. The approach used for developing and addressing research\r\nquestions will incorporate the central principles of the Indigenous Evaluation framework, an\r\napproach to research on and evaluation of American Indian education and other programs\r\ndeveloped by the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) with support from the\r\nNational Science Foundation (LaFrance and Nichols 2010). For this project, the research\r\napproach makes central the values and interests of groups most concerned with the academic\r\nachievement of CDKC students and relationship to the Northern Cheyenne community. It also\r\nbuilds on prior sociological research on Northern Cheyenne secondary school completion (Ward\r\n2005) that identified individual, family, school and community as particularly relevant influences.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  This research program represents important questions related to American Indian tribal college\r\nstudent retention and completion in relation to STEM that moves well beyond any analyses to\r\ndate on Northern Cheyenne college students. It also fills gaps in understandings about the\r\nprocesses that contribute to student outcomes in a tribal college setting that is both unique and\r\nrelevant to other higher education settings. It will create the basis for addressing how\r\nrelationships with local and regional institutions and the research opportunities they offer impact\r\nstudents and faculty. Additionally, the capabilities resulting from this project provide for sharing\r\nand disseminating research results to educators at other tribal colleges and higher education\r\ninstitutions who have similar concerns about and interests in creating more effective STEM\r\nlearning opportunities for American Indian and other minority students.",
