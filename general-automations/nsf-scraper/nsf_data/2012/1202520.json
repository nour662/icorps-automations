The Collaborative Infrastructure at CUNY allows for adaption and adoption of best practices in educational pedagogy, and cutting edge STEM research. Alliance activity in Phases I, and II (1992-2002) centered on adoption and adaption of the Collaborative Learning Approaches, Workshop and Peer Led Team Learning Models, and the TINTO models to increase the number of students who would successfully complete the STEM gatekeeper courses. Phases III and IV led to institutionalization of Phase I and II practices, and an increased focus on the Research and Training of LSAMP Scholars and access to Graduate Education.\r\n  \r\nActivities 2012-2017 will build on the institutionalized activities across CUNY to increase the annual BA/BS degree production in STEM to 1000 degrees per year from 700 per annum. Continued focus at the Community College will result in 1) early intervention, 2) greater transfer rates, and 3) degree completion/retention in the STEM disciplines. LSAMP Research and Training activities will 1) expand the diversity and multidisciplinary nature of the 21st Century STEM training, 2) increase the number of opportunities to LSAMP participants, and 3) offer early introduction to research resulting in an increased number of students attracted to the STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe following are program activities for NYC Alliance 2012-2017: \r\n? Student Success towards Graduation in STEM \r\n? Partnerships and Collaborations \r\n? Community College Focus \r\n? International Summer Opportunities for Research Training \r\n?

From inception in the 1991/1992 academic year, the Alliance member campuses of the City University of New York have graduated over 18,000 underrepresented minority students with baccalaureate degrees in STEM. The NYC LSAMP involves 17 of CUNY?s 18 academic campuses, including the Graduate School and University Center (GSUC), CUNY's Ph.D. degree-granting unit. The NYC LSAMP Undergraduate and Graduate Research Program,<strong> </strong>continues to be the heart of the NYC Alliance. The program includes faculty mentoring, research experiences on or off CUNY campuses, research enrichment, career development, and international research. It serves as a model for integrating an alliance into the fabric of a large urban university system with an array of instititutions having diverse missions.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Outcomes Metric 2012-2018</strong></p>\n<p>The NYC Alliance (CUNY) saw a more than two-fold increase of 108% (to 1,529) in underrepresented minority 2018 BA/BS graduates over the 2012 level (757).&nbsp; Over the period 2012-2018, CUNY graduated 7734 underrepresented students in the STEM disciplines.

Participation from all communities across our nation is a national imperative. In the past two decades the NYC Alliance has developed a Collaborative Infrastructure across the City University of New York to ensure the university-wide maintenance of a significant pool of underrepresented minorities in the STEM disciplines graduating with BS/BA degrees. The Collaborative Infrastructure includes the leadership, financial and physical commitments of Chancellors, Vice-Chancellors, Campus Presidents and other senior administrators and the dedication of faculty members who now mentor the LSAMP Scholars.</p>\n<p>The Collaborative Infrastructure at CUNY allows for adaption and adoption of best practices in educational pedagogy, and cutting edge STEM research.

A number of the national priorities dovetails with the university?s goals and activities: 1) the Expansion of the role of Community Colleges in access to higher education, 2) increasing the Research and Training capacity through faculty hiring and facilities upgrades, 3) creating a Globally Competent workforce and 4) creating a culture of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the campuses.\n\nThe following are major program thrusts for  2012-2018:\n\nStudent Success Towards Graduation in STEM\n\nContinuation of the Integrated Research Strategies approaches allowing for earlier exposure to the STEM enterprise across CUNY, particularly at the Community Colleges, a major entry point to URM in CUNY.                               \nPathways-The approach based on the General Education Framework, the Pathway for the Largest Transfer Majors and Full Course Transferability system-wide.\n\n\nCourse and      curriculum improvements in      areas such as the chemical sciences, which serve as a major entry point to      a number of other STEM disciplines, as well as a basis for other      disciplines such as environmental sciences and sustainability. \n\n\nThe NYC Alliance 2012-2018 will continue      to focus on strategies to increase the enrollment and graduation of      underrepresented minorities to 1000 degrees per year.\n\n\nPartnerships and Collaborations\n\nInter-LSAMP Collaborations will be further      developed to include Summer Research and International collaborations, in      addition to the National Alliance Conferences, Expos, the Urban University      Conference Series, ProjectSTEM, and  student development  and mentoring workshops.\n\n\nCommunity College Focus\n\nThe Alliance will continue to work toward full integration of research scholars at community colleges with Alliance programmatic activities and seamless transition in the research experience when these scholars matriculate at the senior colleges to finish their education.\n\n\nCollaborative Management Infrastructure\n\nThe NYC Louis Stokes Alliance has put in place number of committees which foster CUNY wide consistency, provide coherence, and manage the collaborative infrastructure.  These committees include: the LSAMP Governing Board (which is chaired by the CUNY Executive Vice chancellor and includes senior-level administrators including several campus Presidents), the LSAMP Steering Commitee (of campus leaders and central LSAMP management), the LSAMP Activity Coordinator?s Committee,  and individual Campus LSAMP steering committees (on all participating campuses).  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles B Watkins"
