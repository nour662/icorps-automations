 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a new collaborative Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site focused on Signal and Image Processing at the University of Central Florida and Florida Institute of Technology.  Each year 13 high school teachers from school districts in four Central Florida counties will participate in research projects at the universities.  The teachers will also develop modules related to their research which they will implement in their classes in the following school year.  The teachers will organize annual science events to share their work with the communities around their schools and they will participate in the Florida Science Olympiad.  Through participation in the RET Site the teachers will have an enhanced knowledge base in engineering and computer science and the skills to translate this into their classroom practices, thus impacting their students and motivating them towards science, technology, computing, and engineering disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project revolves around the expertise of the research team and outstanding research environment in which the teachers will work.  The research projects are compelling and are in areas that are of current interest. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include substantial impact on the area schools and dissemination to a broad community. Teachers will incorporate new computing and engineering topics into their classes and develop hands-on ways to impart these topics to secondary students.  The teachers will also engage in public outreach to convey the concepts and appreciation of computer science and engineering to the public.  Through this project, a long-term relationship between the university and the schools will be forged and cemented. The partners will work together to build a foundation of outstanding computing and engineering education in the region.",

The goal of AEGIS was to actively involve high school teachers in Signal &amp; Image Processing (SIP) research in order to: (A) bring knowledge of engineering and technological innovation in their classrooms, and (B) experience an authentic research environment, which can then be communicated to their students. In specific, the project's 5 main objectives were:</p>\n<p>1. To recruit a diverse, talented, high school teacher population from Central Florida counties.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. To actively engage the recruited teachers in research within the field of SIP, an area that has been in the frontier of research areas in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering for decades.</p>\n<p>3. To develop and disseminate to a large audience a series of innovative and replicable secondary science teaching lesson plans (LPs), that would enable teachers to successfully transfer the new knowledge that they have attained during their summer experiences into their classrooms during the following academic year.</p>\n<p>4. To disseminate the results of this RET effort to other interested stakeholders around the nation.</p>\n<p>5. To establish a lasting partnership between faculty and teachers in the participating Central Florida school districts.</p>\n<p>In the years 2012 through 2016, the Program offered five 6-week long summer experiences, during which high school teachers were immersed in SIP research. These teachers were first trained in MATLAB/GNU Octave, were provided a background in SIP and were introduced to their research projects. Subsequently, they started developing LPs around their projects to convey important mathematics and science concepts that were connected to (i) Florida and Common Core educational standards and (ii) real-world, SIP-related applications. In their efforts, they were aided, by faculty mentors, graduate students and teacher mentors. Past summer, the teachers delivered their LPs in their classrooms and reported back their classroom experiences and findings. Their refined LPs were published on the project's webpage for broader dissemination. In 2017 and 2018, the Program offered two SIP Workshops to enable additional teachers to use these LPs in their classrooms.</p>\n<p>During its lifetime, the Program hosted 35 high-school mathematics and physics/science teachers through its summer research experiences. Furthermore, it involved 16 additional teachers in its 2017, 2018 SIP workshops. Overall, it involved 51 teachers from 27 high schools located in 8 Central Florida public school districts. These teachers, individually or in teams, developed 25 LPs, of which 22 were delivered in classrooms. Given that Florida high school classroom size averages range from 10 to 22 students per class, the estimated number of students that have benefited from these LPs is 220 to 484. However, these numbers are conservative, since teacher participants delivered these LPs in class more than once. Furthermore, high schools, from which teacher participants originated, installed GNU Octave in their computer labs. This allowed teachers to use GNU Octave to demonstrate the results of their AEGIS RET experience, as well as for other purposes. From their students' perspective, this created the opportunity for them to experiment with the developed demonstrations and, for some of them, to significantly increase their interest in computing.</p>\n<p>Over the project's course, a series of presentations were given and several grant-supported publications were produced. In specific, the Program supported 10 presentations, of which 8 were at state-level conferences (Annual Conference of the Florida Council of Teachers of Mathematics (by FCTM)) and 2 were at the national level (Annual Meeting &amp; Exposition of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (by NCTM) and National Conference on Science Education (by NSTA)). During these presentations, the AEGIS teachers showcased the educational materials the Program produced and the associated outcomes stemming from the in-class delivery of these LPs. Additionally, the Program directly or indirectly supported a number of technical publications. In particular, the graduate students and faculty involved in the Program produced 2 Master's thesis, 5 doctoral dissertations, 10 peer-reviewed conference papers and 7 peer-reviewed journal publications. Lastly, the AEGIS RET Program inspired and aided the spawning of two additional RET programs at UCF.</p>\n<p>The AEGIS RET Program contributed to (1) educator development: AEGIS teachers received training in MATLAB/GNU Octave and SIP to increase their technological competences, learned how to conduct research, how to work in teams, how to present their results to a variety of audiences, and how to incorporate research results in their curriculum, (2) improving STEM education towards the development of a globally-competitive STEM workforce: teaching key mathematics and science concepts via real-world applications has proven to be an effective way of communicating the value of pursuing a STEM career, which is a matter of national importance, and (3) forming and nurturing long lasting partnerships between FIT/UCF and their surrounding public school districts.<br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/22/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;Georgiopoulos</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1200566/1200566_10181269_1545397133370_Photo1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1200566/1200566_10181269_1545397133370_Photo1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Geometry students learning with GNU Octave\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1200566/1200566_10181269_1545397133370_Photo1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Geometry students learning with GNU Octave\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Central Florida high school students in 2016 using GNU Octave to discover the effects of geometric transformations applied to digital images.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ana Gonzalez de Enriquez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;Georgiopoulos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Geometry students learning with GNU Octave</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1200566/1200566_10181269_1545397183526_Photo2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1200566/1200566_10181269_1545397183526_Photo2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2015 AEGIS RET Participants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1200566/1200566_10181269_1545397183526_Photo2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2015 AEGIS RET Participants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2015 teacher participants and some of the Program's staff outside FIT's Engineering building.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bonnie Sawn</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;Georgiopoulos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2015 AEGIS RET Participants</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
