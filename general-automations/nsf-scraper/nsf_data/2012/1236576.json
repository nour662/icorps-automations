 "awd_abstract_narration": "1236576\r\nVenerus\r\n\r\nFlows of complex fluids are ubiquitous and can be found both in nature and in modern manufacturing technologies.  Synthetic polymers, biological fluids and foods are common examples of complex fluids that display rheological, or flow, behavior that is difficult to both measure experimentally and predict theoretically.  A novel rheological technique called Continuous Lubricated Squeezing Flow (CLSF) is used to investigate the rheological behavior of polymeric liquids in equibiaxial elongation flows, which involves the stretching of a fluid in two directions.  This study allows heretofore unavailable structure-property relations to be established that will be invaluable to polymer chemists and process engineers, as well as to theoreticians in their efforts to develop molecular models for polymer dynamics.  An improved understanding of polymer flow behavior will result in more efficient energy and materials utilization and to the development of advanced processing methodologies.  An outreach component is integrated with the scientific investigation that involves the development of instructional modules on complex fluids by faculty and students in the Department of Math and Science Education (MSE) at Illinois Institute of Technology.  The MSE Department has well-established education and training programs for high-school teachers in the Chicago Public Schools.",
