 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in biodiversity research have led to progress in two separate directions that focus first on how organisms change over time, and second on spatial patterns of biodiversity at a given time. The proposed research brings together these two approaches to understand biodiversity in a dynamic context. Fundamental research questions are: (1) how are the rate and order of diversification in different groups of organisms determined by the community in which they live, and (2) how does the sequence of diversification dictate the resulting community composition?  The research focuses on insects and spiders and uses the known dynamic geology of the young islands of the Hawaiian archipelago, where different contemporary sites represent stages in a geological sequence, as a system for examining feedbacks between adaptation, population divergence, and associated community succession. Methods include: (1) genomic and other molecular tools to measure active diversification of interacting groups of species that are recent arrivals to these novel habitats, and (2) ecological and computational approaches to measure changes in species composition over time.\r\n\r\nThe research will determine the importance of changing roles of species within communities as populations diverge over time and assemble in space, and the role of that dynamic community in fostering diversification. The work also informs applied areas of invasion and conservation biology, and restoration ecology, by testing the importance of priority, sequence, and associated interaction strengths. The project will train multiple undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdocs in research at the intersection between evolutionary biology and ecology.",

These efforts are proceeding in two largely distinct directions: (1) ecological, where complex communities are dissected and compared for clues of their assembly and emergent properties; and (2) evolutionary, using population genetics and phylogenetic tools to understand the dynamic behavior of lineages over space and time. In this project, we merged these two approaches to better understand the ecological and evolutionary processes underlying the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. The synergy between the two approaches was actuated through the study of spiders and insects of the Hawaiian Islands, which together represent a time series of community &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; over millions of years, provided by the dynamic volcanism of the young islands. A combination of community ecological approaches alongside genomics of select evolutionary lineages allowed an investigation of the importance of changing functional roles of taxa within communities as they differentiate and assemble, and the role of that dynamic community in fostering diversification of the Hawaiian arthropod fauna. In other words, we asked, how do complex and diverse arthropod communities develop over geological time? Does diversity beget more diversity through adaptation, differentiation, and specialization, or is this process dependent on repeated colonization events? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>To investigate how biodiversity and community metrics change over evolutionary time, we developed a network of sites on four of the main Hawaiian Islands representing a chronosequence of island ages (Hawaii 0-500kyrs; Maui and Molokai 1-1.5Myrs; Kauai ~5Myrs). Focal sites were selected to have similar native forest composition (dominated by Metrosideros polymorpha [Myrtaceae]), elevation (1100&ndash;1400 m) and rainfall (mean annual precipitation 2000&ndash;3000 mm), but with distinct geological age. We then selected up to six replicate 15m radius plots using a randomization algorithm and LiDAR forest structural data provided by the Carnegie Airborne Observatory. We sampled arthropod communities and vegetation characteristics from more than 90 plots at 17 sites over 2+ years. Arthropods were sorted and identified, with subsets pulled out to test metagenomics sequencing techniques as an alternative to community quantification. Alongside the ecological sampling, collaborators from Cornell, UC Berkeley, and the University of Hawaii - Hilo sampled lineages of spiders, flies, beetles, and crickets for phylogenetic analysis of species-rich focal lineages.</p>\n<p>Overall, the project developed a template for studying the assembly of communities based on network theory, the theory of island biogeography and coevolutionary models focusing on how age and the temporal turnover of community composition affect the structure of interactions. We show that in mature communities with low species turnover, selection will favor interaction niche partitioning leading to modular patterns of interactions. In contrast, in young communities with high species turnover, selection will favor interaction niche overlap, leading to generalized or nested interaction patterns. The study holds tremendous potential for providing insights into patterns of community stability and invasibility.</p>\n<p>The study improves the scientific basis for making management decisions, for example for designing reserve systems or managing biodiversity under threats of biological invasions and pathogens. The investigators have disseminated their findings through scientific publications, newsletter articles, and frequent correspondence with land managers, with whom the investigators sustain close partnerships. In addition, this project has enabled training of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows through their participation and collaboration in research. The undergraduate students were recruited through summer internship programs at the University of Hawaii, Hilo, which has a successful record of training under-represented and Native Hawaiian students in environmental sciences. Finally, this collaborative research has contributed to enhancing partnerships between three universities and the USDA Forest Service Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry nd four major research
