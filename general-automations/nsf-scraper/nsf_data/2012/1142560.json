 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research project proposes to develop and commercialize an active driving\r\naid to enable semi-autonomous, cooperative navigation of an electric power wheelchair (EPW) both\r\nindoors and in dynamic, outdoor environments. The device is called CoPilot and is intended to be used\r\nby EPW users who suffer from deteriorating cognitive, perceptive, or motor function. CoPilot is an intelligent\r\nsensor and semi-autonomous drive control system that works in cooperation with the driver to aid\r\nin negotiating changing terrain, avoiding obstacles/collisions, and maintaining a straight path. The goal is\r\nto prolong independent living and safety for seniors in their homes. The basis for the innovation is that as\r\nan elder person begins to lose perceptive or motor function, CoPilot can augment that loss because it can\r\ninterpret the user?s intent and it can see out into the environment on their behalf. This project will leverage\r\nthe latest in 3D LIDAR technology for robust perception, exploit the team?s experience in commercializing\r\nthe smart wheelchair of the Automated Transport and Retrieval System (including acquiring FDA approval),\r\nand will apply the knowledge the team has gained in developing autonomous driving solutions through their\r\nparticipation in the DARPA Urban Challenge.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable prolonged independent living and safety\r\nfor seniors in their homes while also providing significant economic relief to the U.S. healthcare system. The\r\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that the number of people over the age of 65 will\r\nincrease from 38.9 million people in 2008 to over 70 million by 2030. This rapid growth in the U.S. elder\r\npopulation will also increase the number of people with age-related symptoms that hamper their mobility.\r\nSuch common symptoms include visual impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer?s disease. A second, more\r\nserious side effect of this aging population is that it will place unprecedented strains on the U.S. healthcare\r\nsystem. This impact can be moderated in part by enabling individuals to maintain their independence and\r\nsafety while living at home longer. It is estimated that adding a single month of independence and health to\r\nAmerica?s elder population would save $5 billion, while decreasing hospitalization and institutionalization\r\n10% would save $50 billion annually. As a result, technology for home-centered approaches to healthcare,\r\nsuch as CoPilot, are necessary.",
