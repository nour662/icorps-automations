 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award supports our continuing research program at Jefferson Lab using electromagnetic probes to study hadronic matter at the fundamental level.  Our group focuses on four experimental efforts that test the basic nature of particle interactions at the quark gluon level.  Five particle tracking drift chambers are currently being constructed at ISU to support Jefferson Lab's Hall B 12 GeV program.  One of our experiments extracts polarization observables from meson photoproduction with linearly-polarized photons on the proton and deuteron and will result in two ISU PhD theses during this funding period.  Another experiment will investigate quark distributions at extreme kinematics where the quarks carry most of the nucleon's momentum.  A high-precision measurement of the pion lifetime is being undertaken in Jefferson Lab's Hall B.  This experimental effort seeks to probe the mechanism through which a neutral charged pion can decay into two photons to stringently test confinement-scale quantum chromodynamics.  Another high-precision experiment in Hall A, MOLLER, uses the parity-violating property of the weak interaction to measure a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model known as the Weinberg (or mixing) angle to within a relative uncertainty of 0.1%.  When combined with other experiments, this measurement will place strong constraints on proposed extensions to our present version of the Standard Model.  \r\n\r\nThese research programs at JLab, the accelerator facilities at ISU, and continuous detector construction projects in the group's Laboratory for Detector Science, combine in an active program to provide a breadth of experiences for four graduate students and to train the next generation of scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding the forces at play within the nucleus of an atom is an essential mission of the nuclear physicist.  These forces dictate the internal structure of protons and neutrons as well as how they are arranged within nuclei.  One of the experimental techniques used by physicists to probe or explore this internal structure involves passing a beam of electrons or photons through specific target materials and detecting the outgoing subatomic particles involved or created in the induced nuclear reactions.  One of the main outcomes from the research supported by this award was the construction and delivery of one such particle detector system: The Jefferson Lab CLAS12 Region I Drift Chambers (see figure 1).  These devices make-up the first of a three region detector package designed to provide the trajectories of the nuclear reaction participants.  These trajectories allow scientists to determine the participants' charge and momentum--information vital to the reconstruction and understanding of the specific nuclear reaction under investigation.  The completion of these detectors was a critical prerequisite for the start of future experiments in the upgraded-energy (12 GeV) era of Jefferson Lab's physics program.  These detectors will serve over 100 physicists (including principle investigators of this award) as they pursue experimental endeavors designed to elucidate the nature of nuclear forces and test the underlying theories describing the dynamics of nuclear constituents.\n\nWhile the research supported by this award has produced tangible outcomes, including constructed detector hardware, analysis results, and publications, it has also produced other, less tangible outcomes such as contributing to the training of the next generation of nuclear physicists and scientists. This award supported the work of three PhD students, two of which graduated during this award period.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dustin E Mcnulty"
