 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to renew the existing successful CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site at Virginia Tech University.  The REU Site will provide undergraduate students with immersive, high-quality learning and interdisciplinary research experience in cognitive communications, an emerging wireless communications technology. The students will implement their projects on the Virginia Tech Cognitive Radio Network testbed (VT-CORNET).   The students will participate in professional development activities that make them more aware of graduate school and professional aspects of a computing career. \r\n  \r\nThe students will join a variety of funded research projects ongoing at the Wireless@VT center and work with a faculty team with outstanding experience and expertise to direct the intellectual component of each project.  Cognitive communications is an emerging and exciting field that promises to transform the wireless communications industry.  The focus will be on topics such as spectrum management for wireless networks, public safety interoperable radios, rural broadband access, usability and human factors principles for cognitive engines and interface design that are important and timely. Thus the project has the potential to contribute to the advancement of research and discovery in an important and timely area of computing.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups and from institutions with limited research environments. Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.",

The 32 students (9 women and 23 men, 10-12 participants each summer) came to Virginia Tech from Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Puerto Rico, and Texas as well as less distant locations, and worked with faculty and graduate student researchers on a variety of research projects related to combining traditional radio or wireless communication technology with newer technologies such as digital signal processing, machine learning, and graphical human-machine interfaces.\n\nContent of the REU\n\nThe technologies that were the focus of the REU are expected to help enable a new era of wireless communications, in which the radio spectrum, the range of frequencies used for wireless communication, radar, and other applications such as radio astronomy and microwave cooking, is shared more efficiently among government and commercial, licensed and unlicensed users.  Following recommendations such as those in a 2012 report by the President\u00c6s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) that projected a trillion dollars in societal benefits and enhanced U.S. technological leadership could be achieved by early adoption of this spectrum-sharing approach, the FCC has already begun to change regulations in selected frequency bands.  Access to the radio spectrum will be prioritized, and radios and wireless networks are expected to have the ability to sense and use vacant frequencies and / or reserve frequencies from a central clearing house for a given time and location, and then move from these frequencies to others as needed to make room for radios and networks that have higher priority.\n\nEach summer, a group of REU participants went through an intensive two-week, hands-on introduction to wireless and cognitive communication, and spent the next eight weeks working with faculty and graduate student researchers on research projects.  As an example, the summer 2014 project topics included:\n\nCognitive Radio Characterization to enable Malware Detection\nAn Experimental Demonstration of Dynamic Spectrum Access System\nWaveform Development using REDHAWK IDE\" [integrated development environment\nSampling Mixer for Software Defined Radio Applications in 0.18um CMOS Technology\n\n\nParticipants were encouraged to present results to other researchers at conferences, including IEEE SoutheastCon, a national meeting of the American Geophysical Union, and the State of North Carolina Undergraduate Research &amp; Creativity Symposium (SNCURCS). \n\nStudents who took part in the REU attended or participated in special events such as:\n  \n\nA final examination in which a Master of Science student presented and defended his thesis research on a topic related to the REU, and a question and answer session with the student after his successful defense, to provide a preview for prospective graduate students\nLive video meetings with Dr. Joseph Mitola, who coined the term \"Cognitive Radio\" in the late 1990s and set an agenda for research in this area and Dr. John Bard, a major expert in software defined radio (SDR)\nA day trip to attend the 2013 EAI International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications (CROWNCOM) in Washington, DC, where REU participants met and attended presentations by several internationally known researchers and NSF program directors\nA question and answer session about the REU experience and graduate school with a past cognitive communications REU participant who had completed a Master\u00c6s degree and begun a Ph.D. program\nField measurements in which students observed radio spectrum occupancy using both low-cost radios and portable laboratory test equipment\n\n \n\nParticipation\n\nThe participants were diverse in terms of demographics and also the type of institutions attended.
