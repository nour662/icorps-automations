 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project partners Austin Peay State University (APSU) with Columbia State Community College, Volunteer State Community College, Nashville State Community College, and the APSU Center located on the Fort Campbell Military Base (in Fort Campbell, KY) in order to increase the number and graduation rates of students transferring from regional community colleges and from military service to four-year STEM degrees at APSU.  The scholarship program offers 15-30 scholarships per year, with students receiving support for one to three years.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the scholarship program are to:\r\n     -  improve the graduation rate of students that transfer to APSU after completing an Associate of Science degree at a community college;\r\n     -  increase the number of community college students seeking a B.S. in a STEM discipline;\r\n     -  increase the number of Active Duty Military Personnel, Veterans and Dependents enrolling and completing a B.S. in a STEM Discipline; and\r\n     -  work with students to identify career paths early and help them successfully transition to either a job or graduate school immediately upon completing their B.S.\r\n\r\nThe project explores the effect that providing financial, academic, career and social support to community college and military students has on the number of students entering four-year STEM programs and their success rate in these programs.  Core support structures used to increase success for transfer students and students with military backgrounds include: a Summer Bridge Program; S-STEM students living together in a wing of a new dormitory: monthly meetings with an assigned faculty mentor; encouragement of scholarship students to become peer mentors; including partner community colleges in APSU STEM events; and seminars by individuals in STEM disciplines/industry/careers.\r\n\r\nIn the geographic area served by APSU and the partner institutions, there are insufficient college students in STEM disciplines to meet the projected needs of the region.  A particular need is due to the recent opening by Hemlock Semiconductor of a $1.2 billion facility in Clarksville TN (the home of APSU).  It is anticipated that the opening of this large polysilicon producing facility will attract other high tech industry to the region that will require additional STEM graduates in the future.",
