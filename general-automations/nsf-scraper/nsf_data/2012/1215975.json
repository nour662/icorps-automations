This annual conference is organized by The Minerals Metals & Materials Society (TMS), to bring the Metals and Materials community together to present, learn about, and discuss recent developments in the field. Technical Sessions will be held on Dislocation Organization, Plastic Flow, Screw Dislocations, Lattice Friction, Intermetallic Alloys, Nanograined Materials and Deformation Mechanisms. The aim of this symposium is to bring together scientists from these different communities to communicate about interrelationships between experiment and simulations in these topics. NSF funding will be used to defray the costs of registration fees for 7 students and 4 selected speakers or attendees who will be identified by the organizing committee. The organizing committee may invite qualified candidates by contacting university departments and/or laboratories that are known to have strong programs in areas related to the symposium topic. Every effort will be made to encourage candidates from underrepresented groups to apply for these registration fee waivers.",
