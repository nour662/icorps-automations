 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to (1) leverage collaborative measurements of biomass burning (BB) emissions and chemistry to better understand the essential compounds and processes contributing to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in smoke plumes, and (2) develop an SOA model framework to improve predictions of organic aerosol formation and transport in fire-influenced regions. In this study, detailed chemical analyses of SOA precursors in fire emissions and their reaction products will be conducted at the US Forest Service Fire Science Laboratory using two-dimensional gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC/TOFMS) during the fourth Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment (FLAME-IV). GCxGC analyses, augmented by complementary gas- and particle-phase measurements from the FLAME-IV campaign, will be used to develop a process-level model describing SOA formation, including the contribution of components evaporating from primary particles during plume dilution. The SOA module will be subsequently integrated into a comprehensive smoke plume model that includes calculations of aerosol water uptake and optical properties, thereby allowing improved assessments of fire-induced radiative forcing, as well as predictions of BB pollutant formation and transport for assessment of air quality downwind of fires. The work will be conducted under the mentorship of Prof. Kelley Barsanti at Portland State University (PSU).\r\n\r\nPotential broader impacts of several kinds are associated with this research. The FLAME-IV campaign will bring together researchers and their associated instrumentation from ten other institutions, creating new partnerships and datasets that are complementary to the PSU analyses. The smoke plume SOA model framework can be adapted and integrated into publically-available models (e.g., EPA's Community Multiscale Air Quality model, CMAQ) for access by the broader scientific community and policymakers nationwide. For example, such enhancements of CMAQ for predictions of BB-SOA formation and transport may be used by municipalities throughout the U.S. to inform scheduling of prescribed burns to maintain compliance with national particulate matter standards or to provide air quality alerts during wildfire activity. The project will provide the principal investigator with career development training in addition to enhanced opportunities for networking and outreach (e.g., mentoring underrepresented high-school students as part of the Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering program at PSU). Under the Center for Climate and Aerosol Research (CCAR) at PSU, additional opportunities exist for direct involvement in community engagement by assisting in the coordination of climate-related seminars accessible to the public and participating in K-12 classroom visits. These various outreach activities will provide important avenues for enhancing atmospheric science education and facilitating integration of research and education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBiomass burning (BB) emissions strongly influence global tropospheric chemistry and climate.  BB is the second largest source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) worldwide.  These gas-phase species emitted during fires may undergo photochemical processes and/or react with gas-phase oxidants, ultimately leading to lower volatility compounds that may condense into existing particles, thereby forming secondary organic aerosol (SOA).  Thus the objectives of this work were two-fold: (1) to better characterize the VOCs (SOA precursors) emitted from biomass burning; and (2) to construct and apply a detailed chemical model describing SOA formation from BB emissions.\n\nIn this project, VOCs emitted from BB were measured by two-dimensional gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC/TOFMS) for the first time as part of the fourth Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment (FLAME-4).  Smoke samples were analyzed from burns of six different globally relevant plant fuels.  In these samples, a total of 674 compounds were identified, with significant variation in the number of compounds detected from each smoke sample, ranging from 129 to 474. These measurements have also provided the first comprehensive characterization of intermediate volatility alkanes/alkenes in BB, with compounds up to C15 present in most smoke samples and as high as C18 in the case of an Indonesian peat fire.  Overall, the distribution of emissions among different compound classes was found to vary considerably from fuel to fuel, indicating that the dominant reaction pathways in aging smoke plumes will be highly dependent on the burned fuel types.  These data underscore the complexity of BB emissions and represent the most comprehensive emission measurements to date.\n\nThe GCxGC/TOFMS measurements have elucidated a large number of potential SOA precursors in BB emissions, including abundant isomers of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, phenol derivatives, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. The observed compounds have been screened to assess likely SOA formation potential, and the potential contribution of major compound classes to SOA have been determined for each measured fuel type.  Given the high complexity of VOCs emitted by BB, as observed by GCxGC/TOFMS, we are pursuing multiple avenues for mechanistic modeling studies of BB plume chemistry/SOA formation.\n\nRegarding broader impacts, the GCxGC/TOFMS measurements will help improve BB emissions inventories that are utilized by many regional- and global-scale atmospheric models.  In particular, our measured emission factors will be included in the next major update to the Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINN) for use by fire and air quality managers.  The PI has also volunteered with Girls Inc. as a Girl\u00c6s Guide throughout the summer of 2014.  During this program, 4th and 5th- grade girls of predominantly under-represented groups built and programmed Lego robots.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lindsay Hatch"
