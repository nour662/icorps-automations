 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neodymium isotope ratios (143Nd/144Nd) are increasingly used as tracers of past ocean circulation patterns. However, our understanding of marine Nd dynamics, and thus the reliability of Nd as an oceanic tracer, is currently complicated by an apparent disconnect between the isotopic compositions of Nd (which are distinctive between ocean basins) and the distribution of elemental Nd (which appears to be driven by water column cycling). It is important to resolve this \"Nd paradox\" in order to refine tracer studies of past ocean behavior. \r\n\r\nPrior research suggests that the decoupling of isotopic and elemental Nd may occur near the interface between marine sediments and bottom waters. This study, conducted by researchers at Oregon State University, investigates exchange reactions between dissolved and particulate Nd occurring at and around this interface, with a focus on the influence of diagenetic sedimentary processes on Nd isotope ratios. Porewater, sediment, and water column samples will be collected along the Oregon continental margin and analyzed for Nd isotopes and other relevant tracers (including rare earth elements, carbon, and nitrogen). The resulting dataset will not only help to resolve the Nd paradox, but will also be applied to future conceptual and chemical modeling efforts, which in turn will inform the development of paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic models.\r\n\r\nThis project will be incorporated into the COSEE (Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence) Pacific Partnerships ocean literacy effort. A PRIME (Promoting Research Investigations in the Marine Environment) intern, as well as two OSU students (PhD and undergraduate), will be involved in this research. The project includes international collaboration with a geochemist from the University of Bristol, which will strengthen Oregon State University's analytical capabilities. Funding will also help support an early-career researcher at Oregon State University.",

Not surprisingly either: neodymium and its sister elements, the 14 rare earth elements, are all found at trace levels in the environment.  However, these elements and the isotopes of neodymium are actually very powerful tracers of the ubiquitous processes that occur in the environment: everything from elemental exchanges between water and clay particles to global circulation of the oceans.

Specifically, we attempted to reconcile inconsistent distributions of elemental and isotopic neodymium seen in the water column (the \"neodymium paradox\").  These data - never before collected due to the challenging nature of sample collection - would help constrain the marine geochemical cycle of these chemical species, and provide a more thorough mechanistic understanding of their use for interpreting molecular to global level processes in the oceans. \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThis project successfully made the very first measurements of both neodymium isotopes and rare earth element concentrations from the pore water of marine sediments.  The data, while internally consistent, were almost entirely unexpected, and compelled us to develop an alternative model for understanding the marine geochemical cycle of neodymium isotopes and rare earth elements in the oceans.  Detailed in three scientific publications, our conceptual model poses three transformative ideas:\n\n1. Early diagenetic reactions in upper sea floor sediments represent the largest source of rare earth elements to the oceans, far greater than riverine or dust fluxes.\n\n2. Amorphous authigenic phases in the sediments act as a \"geochemical capacitor\" of rare earth elements: behaving as both a source and sink of these chemical species.\n\n3.  The benthic flux drives non-conservative distributions in the overlying water column, conceptualized by the \"exposure time\" of bottom water to the benthic flux.\n\nThese ideas represent a departure from the prevalent model of the marine geochemistry of rare earth elements and neodymium isotopes.  While nascent, the ideas developed from this work can reconcile the \"neodymium paradox\" and offers a direction to move forward for interpreting data that to date has been considered anomalous.  One particular case is that our model will have great bearing on interpretations of ancient records of neodymium isotopes as a tracer of deep ocean circulation over the past.

Moreover, the mechanistic model we have developed may be far more broadly applicable to many other chemical species such as iron and copper.\n\nOutside academia, our model may remain somewhat esoteric.  However, if found to be accurate, these ideas can go beyond marine geoscience to impact many aspects of society.  Simple examples may be seen in the exploration of the rare earth elements as a mineral resource.  More convoluted impacts are seen in interpretations of neodymium isotopes as a tracer of deep ocean circulation over time, which pertains to the distribution of heat and dissolved carbon dioxide or oxygen: all very important components of climate.\n\nBroader impacts\n\nThis work represents the singular efforts of April Abbott's doctoral dissertation, which was successfully completed in 2016.  As a young female researcher in earth science, April represents advancement in the field towards broader inclusivity.  April is currently in a tenure-track position at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, and continues to develop these ideas.  Several undergraduate students (two female, one male) were involved in this work, each for a minimum of 3 months (summer).  These students were highly involved in all the sampling and analyses done; \"experiential learning\" in this case is an understatement.  Their efforts were very important in moving this project forward.  \n\nThis project also reflects continuing support for the marine science infrastructure - human and physical - at Oregon State University. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian A Haley"
