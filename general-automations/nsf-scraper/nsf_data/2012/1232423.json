 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research is to advance the state of the art of Structural Health Monitoring\r\n(SHM) systems by creating novel Frequency Selective Structures (FSS) and an FSS-based\r\nImpediographic monitoring technique. The proposed approach is based on the concept of concurrent\r\ndesign where the SHM system is no longer retrofitted to an existing structure but, instead, it is designed\r\nconcurrently with the structure itself. The system is achieved by implementing the idea of Frequency\r\nSelective Structure. FSS exploit the concept of mistuned periodic structures as a general framework to\r\nsynthesize dynamically tailored components with self-focusing vibration energy capabilities. The new\r\nstructural design approach will allow delivering targeted excitation to the damaged areas even in complex,\r\nnon homogeneous components. The integration of FSS with the impediographic approach will then enable\r\nadvanced damage identification capabilities characterized by high sensitivity, high resolution and a\r\nminimized transducer and sensory network.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will create a transformative intellectual pathway in synthesizing novel and\r\nrealistic structural damage identification methods of the next generation for complex mechanical systems.\r\nThe technology will have general applicability and could be implemented across the aerospace,\r\nmechanical and civil engineering fields leading to the next generation of transportation and infrastructure\r\nsystems having advanced health monitoring capabilities. The proposed technology will also eliminate the\r\nbarriers that have prevented, to date, the experimental implementation and validation of the\r\nimpediographic approach. Experimental findings will allow an unprecedented insight into impediography\r\nand provide critical inputs to foster its application to diverse fields, such as medical imaging, where\r\nremote non-invasive monitoring techniques are of primary importance. The results will be disseminated\r\nthrough classroom teaching, undergraduate and graduate student mentoring, community outreach, and\r\ncollaboration with potential users.",
