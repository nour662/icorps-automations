 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Raymond Seekell of the University Of Notre Dame to conduct a research project, entitled \"Innovation of a novel lubricant through biological capture,\" during the summer of 2012 at Soochow University in Suzhou, China.  The host scientist is Dr. Zexin Zhang.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to examine and understand the glassy dynamics of confined hydrogel-biopolymer thin films. From these studies, functional lubricious polymeric coatings and lubricants are being developed through biomimetic design. The research involves assessing how a biopolymer affects the dynamics of suspensions hydrogel particles under confinement. Previous studies have looked at the effect of confinement on homogeneous systems, where colloids are only interacting with like colloids. While these are ideal systems, they are not representative of natural systems, which could have extensive applications from bio-lubrication, drug delivery to novel material synthesis for energy storage and conversion. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
