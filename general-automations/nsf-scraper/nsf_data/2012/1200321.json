 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this award is to develop computationally tractable methods for designing and controlling systems that experience impact.  Impacts introduce discontinuities into the equations of motion, making traditional techniques in control theory difficult to employ.  However, if a system can specify its configuration during impact a form of feedback control may be utilized.  The work will use a combination of variational analysis for mechanical systems, shape optimization, and control theory to synthesize embedded controllers for a class of impacting systems with guarantees on stability, optimality, and computational complexity.  The work will start with a simple example of a two-legged robot walking on terrain; later examples will include numerical models of high degree-of-freedom robots walking on uneven terrain and a biomechanical model of a human hand interacting with objects.  Deliverables include mathematical proofs of algorithm properties, a software implementation of the feedback synthesis techniques in a variety of documented examples, articles describing the techniques, and training for students in control engineering and biomedical engineering.\r\n\r\nImpacts are present in applications ranging from robotic locomotion and grasping to manufacturing and even human prosthetics.  Computer control of these systems depends on incorporating impacts into algorithms that stabilize motion.  If successful, the proposed techniques will make practical regulation of many impacting systems as straightforward as regulation of non-impacting systems.  Moreover, the techniques will provide an improved understanding of the role that contact plays in human neuromuscular control.  The project will leverage international collaboration through NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) Global Venture Fund (GVF) co-funding to develop long-term collaboration with researchers in Germany.  Software developed as part of this work will be incorporated into an ongoing clinical study of hand rehabilitation at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago and will be freely available to the public.  In addition to enabling important technologies, the work will be highlighted in a museum, and student will participate in outreach with an urban high school in Chicago.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project \"Physical Design and Feedback Control of Hybrid Mechanical Systems\" (Award 1200321) focused on the development of automatic control algorithms for systems experiencing impact.   Examples of such systems include robotics used in manufacturing, human walking and running models, and other locomotion models of animals.  Moreover, the mathematics describing such systems tend to be the same as those governing large-scale systems such as power networks.  The key insight that initiated the work was that impacting systems could be rewritten in a way that made them similar to problems engineers already know how to solve. \n\nThe work initially determined that indeed many systems, and all typical mechanical systems, can exploit mathematical structure to enable control synthesis using similar methods as those used for nonimpacting systems.  We applied the resulting methods to simple models of locomotion and even used them for a simulation of a power network (modeling a portion of the U.S. power grid).  These numerical methods are both robust and and fast; the methods were additionally implemented on a laboratory experiment for purpose of validation.\n\nIn the midst of this development, an unexpected result was encountered.  The results to this point assumed that the goal was to make impacting systems more like nonimpacting systems.  However, based on insights gleaned from analysis of impacting systems, treating control of a system as a sequence of discrete changes in control decisions led to a closed-form solution for quite general systems.  This problem formulation and corresponding solution, called Sequential Action Control, is very fast to compute.  For example, it can sometimes facilitate real-time computation on a mobile phone for problems that would otherwise take hours or days of computing time on a standard computer.  The Sequential Action Control method was applied to a wide variety of benchmark problems from the academic literature, in all cases providing better solutions with orders of magnitude reduction in computation.  Moreover, the method extends to high dimensional, complex problems previously intractable. \n\nThe importance of this work, particularly Sequential Action Control method, is primarily that it enables automation (e.g., manufacturing systems, robotic exploration, exoskeletons, et cetera) to reactively respond to environmental changes rather than relying on a fixed computational plan.  The scalability of the method means that even sophisticated systems (e.g., exoskeletons) can directly implement the method in software with relative ease.  The techniques are currently being applied to biomedical assistive devices at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\nDuring the period of the award, several important broader impact goals were achieved.  First, a massive open online course (MOOC) was developed for introductory systems theory (Everything Is The Same: Modeling Engineered Systems, available on Coursera), including elements of the research as part of the course.  Second, outreach at the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago was accomplished in each year of the award (2013-2016).  Classes at Northwestern (at the freshman level and at the senior level) incorporated some of the results and problem statements in homework and projects.    Lastly, the application of the developed numerical methods to biomedical devices is a translational accomplishment of the work.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Todd D Murphey"
