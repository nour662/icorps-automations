 "awd_abstract_narration": "Published reports on software-development costs and our interactions with many companies reveal that testing and debugging consume too much of the development costs. Furthermore, the ubiquitous nature of software requires that it be high quality. Thus, there is an urgent need for technology that companies can use to improve the process to reduce the cost of these activities and improve the quality of the software. The technology that this team will explore for commercialization consists of rigorous techniques that are highly automated, and have the potential to improve reliability and adaptability of today's large, complex software systems at a reduced cost. These techniques have provided the foundations in testing and debugging on which many additional techniques have been developed. The techniques have been implemented in prototype tools that have been used for experimentation that shows their effectiveness and efficiency in improving the quality of the software and reducing the cost of achieving it. However, no commercial tools or systems currently provide this advanced technology. The team's project has the potential to provide such tools and systems. \r\n\r\nThe technology the team plans to commercialize will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of software development by addressing the process of testing and debugging. Not only will the technology result in higher-quality software for those companies who use it, but it will provide savings in the costs of the software development. Because the technology can be used for testing and debugging at all levels of development (e.g., individual, team, and system), on systems written in different programming languages and on non-code components (e.g., databases), by companies that develop software for their own use or to sell, and by companies of all sizes, the commercialization of the technology can have a significant impact on industry. If successful in commercializing the technology, the tools and systems being built will ultimately improve software quality and, thus, has the potential to have a significant societal benefit. The project will prepare students and faculty who participate in the important area of entrepreneurship, which will help them transition the technology developed to industry.",
