 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal was submitted to the ship operations program requesting funds to carry out 163 operational days in 2012 aboard the R/V Thomas G. Thompson in support of NSF peer-reviewed sea-going programs. The projected 2012 total number of funded days from all agencies is 277 days, of which 267 days will be days at sea. R/V Thompson will be operating in the Western Pacific off the Mariana\r\nTrench and Forearc for two consecutive MG & G programs, one utilizing the deep-towed sonar system (IMI-120) and a second operating in conjunction with R/V Marcus Langseth for an OBS active and passive source seismic project. Since submission of this proposal, R/V Thompson was able to divert their transit between Apra, Guam and San Diego into Honolulu in order to accommodate two stranded NSF\r\nprojects. These cruises had previously been scheduled on R/V Kilo Moana but following a significant hull compromise a rapid response was required in order to support the cruises within the original project scope. The first cruise for Julian Sachs will\r\nconduct a marine diatom experiment. The second cruise for Zackary Johnson, represents a two day add-on to the transit where he plans to collect biological sampling ahead of his 2013 cruises. R/V Thompson will work south of San Diego in the Oxygen\r\nDeficient Waters off the Eastern Tropical North Pacific for Allan Devol. This cruise has a UW student component, where the University has contributed 12 days of institutional funds to augment the cruise. The second half of 2012, R/V Thompson will be operating\r\nin the Pacific Northwest, in and out of home port supporting NSF work for Cascadia, ODP hydrogeology of Juan De Fuca using borehole network and Jason, CORKS and development of a high speed optical communication system.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nOceanographic vessels, operated by the UNOLS academic institutions and funded by NSF, and \r\nother agencies, have been the traditional multi-use facilities required to expand human \r\nknowledge of the ocean environment. These ships working from the ocean's surface \r\ncomplemented by human-occupied, robotic and more recently -- autonomous undersea vehicles \r\nand sensors, along with aircraft and satellites, continue to provide vital tools in our understanding \r\nof the role of the oceans in determining our climate and in studying and accessing the living and \r\nnon-living resources of the world?s seas and sea-beds. \r\nProper stewardship over ocean resources and their wise use, and decision making for future \r\nocean- and coastal- related issues are inconceivable without an interested and engaged citizenry: \r\nIn addition to technology, our national ocean endeavor requires technical support in the form of \r\nexpert human resources, with sound science, mathematics and technical education:  a critical \r\nmass of individuals who will collect and analyze tomorrow's data, and design the tools, models \r\nand applications we will require.  Provision of these sea-going research and educational facilities \r\nenables marine scientists and students from the University of Washington and other institutions \r\nnationwide to study natural phenomena  and to instruct the future scientists and stewards of our \r\nmarine ecosystems  on board state-of-the-art oceanographic research vessels complete with \r\nlaboratories, sensors, analytical equipment, communications to shore-side investigators and \r\neducators, and full life support for extended missions.  Essential to our mission is the provision \r\nof educational opportunities both to students of the marine sciences, and, through educational \r\noutreach programs such as REVEL, Teacher at Sea, to K through 12th grade students, \r\nnationwide.  Periodically, The University held open houses and outreach events to provide a \r\nlearning experience for local students including tours through the ship facilities and hands-on \r\ndemonstrations of marine science research guided by faculty, students and ships? crewmembers.  \r\nIn 2011, the School of Oceanography hosted the International Research Ship Operators \r\nconference at UW.  During the conference, participants enjoyed the opportunity to tour and ride \r\nonboard for a lunch cruise from the Seattle waterfront, through the Ballard Locks, to the \r\nOceanography Dock.  The University of Washington, with the support of the National Science \r\nFoundation and with coordination by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, \r\nremains dedicated to, and focused upon, furthering mankind's understanding of the world ocean, \r\nthe living and non-living resources therein, and their interactions with the approximately fifty \r\npercent of our citizens who live within fifty miles of the shoreline.",
