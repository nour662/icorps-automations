 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is to explore and create a distributed corrosion monitoring system with multiplexed long period fiber grating sensors that will be packaged with nano ferrous particles filled polymers. The change in wavelength of the fiber gratings is related to the degree of corrosion in the ferrous particles through effective refractive index of the packaged optical fiber. The approach is to develop rugged sensors and deploy them in parallel with corrosion susceptible components (for example, steel beams and reinforcing bars), accurately quantify the corrosion rate and mass loss of ferrous particles in the well-controlled sensor structure, causatively relate the corrosion data from the sensors to their nearby steel components, and cost-effectively assess both pit and uniform corrosion induced deteriorations of the steel components and then the load capacity of their structural system.\r\n\r\nOnce validated and implemented in bridge applications, the proposed corrosion sensors could impact the maintenance and safety of transportation infrastructures. They have the potential to save up to $8 per square foot of bridge decks in the case that the bridge decks are monitored and determined to have an extra year of service. Their outcomes (corrosion rate and mass loss) can be directly used in bridge design and management, thus realizing both short- and long-term benefits. The research findings will be disseminated through technical publications, international workshops, and exchange visits with other peer institutions. Two lecture modules on \"corrosion phenomenon\" and \"assessment tool\" will be developed and used in all education and outreach activities. Underrepresented students will directly participate in this project and get trained with such a highly interdisciplinary research topic.",
