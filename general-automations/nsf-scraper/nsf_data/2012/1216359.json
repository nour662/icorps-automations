 "awd_abstract_narration": "A cost effective and highly-durable wavelength-selective photovoltaic (PV) panel is being developed that simultaneously facilitates plant growth, reduces cooling requirements and generates power at less than $1/watt incremental cost.  The greenhouse uses a luminescent sheet laminated to the glass panels with narrow Si photovoltaic strips to selectively absorb the green portion of the solar spectrum that is not used by plants.  Green light is then selectively downshifted to red light to match to the photosynthetically active region for plants and the efficiency maximum of Silicon-based photovoltaic cells.  The color tuning associated with the conversion of green to red light has been shown to facilitate fruit production in tomatoes and increase flower production.  A prototype greenhouse will be built with suitable control to test the technology under 6-months of California aging conditions and which can respond to customer needs.  This proposal will create a greenhouse that can be remotely monitored via the web to provide results on both plant growth and the energy production. \r\n\r\nCreating energy-neutral greenhouses that can pay for themselves in a few years of operation will open up the ability to grow healthy food in locations where it is currently not economically viable due to the local climate of available resources.  This product will target the rapidly growing-local food industry that saves natural resources by growing food close to where it is consumed.  Natural resources are saved by avoiding food transportation costs, by using the same land to provide both food and electrical energy, and by more efficiently utilizing water resources.  The commercialization of this power-generating greenhouse will open up a new avenue for PV deployment and potentially create U.S. based manufacturing jobs by utilizing our existing window production lines and knowledge.",

Typical customer of the proposed innovation\n\nThe customer was identified as being the greenhouse grower rather than a greenhouse manufacturer or supplier. The size of grower we are most interested to engage with is large with 10-100 acres of technologically advanced glass greenhouses. Engaging directly with the greenhouse owner is the most efficient way to make a sale.\n\nb. Customer need that will be met by the technology\n\nGreenhouse growers will be able to realize much higher profit margins per unit area of greenhouse through significant reduction in energy costs and increased crop yields. We estimate a return on investment of less than 5-years, which was confirmed as reasonable. Greenhouse customers would be able to profit from selling renewable electrical power back to the grid after this 5 year period.\n\nc. How customers currently meets those needs\n\nCustomers currently meet their electrical needs through purchasing power from the electric company, or through installing traditionally mounted PV panels which have an ROI of much longer than 5 years and also take additional land resources to install.\n\nd. Our approach\n\nOur PV technology allows growers to mount PV cells directly over their crops with power production enhanced by a low cost luminescent absorber that additionally tunes the light spectrum to be more favorable for plant growth. This technology is integrated directly into the greenhouse structure, eliminating additional structural costs, with the ability to generate all the electricity that a grower consumes while enhancing crop production while reducing habitat destruction that result from large land installations of photovoltaics.\n\ne.

Depending on the location of the installation (i.e. electricity prices, incentives, and quantity of sunlight), this comes out to ~$100/m2.\n\nProject Outcome and proof of technology\n\nBy the end of I-Corps, Soliculture finished an electricity-generating greenhouse prototype with live electricity-generation monitoring capability and plant trials in session. The response from growers was that they\u00c6d be willing to invest in our technology by buying a system sized to reduce their electricity costs to zero with a payback time of 5-6 years.

One specific result from these connections was our first commercial trial of our product being a 6,000 ft2 installation of our red panels into the greenhouse for one year with continuous monitoring of crop yield and power generation. This grower was interviewed during the I-Corps experience and has been a valuable partner and is now a potential customer of..."
