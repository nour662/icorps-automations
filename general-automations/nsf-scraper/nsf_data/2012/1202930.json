 "awd_abstract_narration": "For decades, ecologists have focused on antagonistic interactions such as competition and predation in studies of ecosystems and food webs.  But in recent years it has become apparent that cooperative interactions among species, i.e., mutualisms, can be equally important to ecosystem structure and function.  One widespread mutualism is that between pollinators and plants, which is of major economic importance to agricultural systems.   However, other types of mutualisms are prevalent in nature, but poorly understood.  This project will study a model system involving a cleaning mutualism, a species interaction in which one organism feeds by cleaning another.  The mutualism involves crayfish and small annelid worms, which live on the gills of crayfish.  The worms clean the crayfish gills by feeding on organisms that attach to the gills; this benefits both the worms and the crayfish.  However, if the worms become too abundant relative to their food, they can switch to act as parasites, feeding directly on the crayfish's gills.  This shift from mutualism to parasitism is not unique to the crayfish-worm system.  It has been hypothesized that such shifts may be widespread in nature in response to certain environmental changes.  This project will test that general hypothesis using both field and laboratory experiments to study the crayfish-worm model system.  The project will examine the importance of species behaviors and other traits in maintaining the interaction at mutually beneficial levels, and explore how the mutualism is shaped by environmental context.  The project will also explore the broader consequences of a shift from mutualism to parasitism to the rest of the food web and stream ecosystem. \r\n\r\nThis project has substantial broader impacts; it is a collaboration among faculty at three universities, one of which is a predominantly undergraduate institution.  Many undergraduate students will be training in aquatic ecology, and will participate in team-structured, multi-year research projects.  A number of graduate students will also be supported by this project, and will lead outreach efforts through partnerships with local watershed associations and university extension programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit.  Symbiotic interactions are close associations between two species.  Symbioses include mutualism, commensalism and parasitism, and nearly every organism on the planet is involved in some symbiosis.  In fact, life on Earth relies on several common symbiotic interactions including plant-pollinator interactions, associations between plants and mycorrhizal fungi, and symbioses between corals and their internal symbionts.  In recent years, even human associations with our own microbial symbionts have proven to be much more important to human health than expected.  However, several outstanding questions exist regarding symbioses. \n\nNot all symbioses are static in their costs and benefits to symbiotic partners.  Several well-described symbioses shift from mutually-beneficial for both partners to parasitism that only benefits one partner.  It is thought that this context dependence is common, though few such systems have been rigorously described. Research on these systems centers around three related questions:  1) How do partners in context dependent symbioses regulate these interactions?  2) How does environmental context affect regulation? and 3) How do these symbioses affect the ecosystems in which they are embedded?  We addressed these questions using a symbiotic interaction between crayfish and a group of worms called branchiobdellidans (aka crayfish worms) that we have studied for about 15 years.  Specifically, we wanted to understand context dependence in the symbiosis and how much of an impact this symbiosis has on freshwater communities. The following are the major findings of our research.\n\n1)  Regulation in context dependent symbioses.  We conducted multiple field experiments demonstrating that the crayfish-branchiobdellidan symbiosis is context dependent and shifts from mutualism to parasitism.  In this interaction, worms often act as cleaners of the gills of host crayfish. This cleaning can improve the ability of crayfish to excrete ammonia which can improve crayfish survival and growth, but an overabundance of worms can lead to parasitism. \n\nBoth partners can regulate the symbiosis.  Crayfish do so by removing worms with their small walking legs. We also found that this behavior changes with crayfish size and species.  Some species of crayfish are completely intolerant of the worms while others are very tolerant.  However, on tolerant hosts, only larger hosts are tolerant, a result that makes sense because the need for crayfish to be cleaned increases with age when molting frequency decreases.  Worms are also able to regulate the symbiosis through host choice and movement behavior.  Worms discriminate between hosts and readily transfer to large or more favorable hosts. \n\nThe combined result of these behaviors is that the worms present on some crayfish species undergo succession in the same fashion that plots of land may undergo succession in plant species from grasses to shrubs to trees. These succession-like patterns are affected by both the crayfish and the worms themselves.  Some worm species are specially adapted to avoid host grooming and persist on smaller host species, while larger worms only exist on larger crayfish and voraciously prey on the smaller worms once they are able to colonize. \n\n2) Environmental context.  We experimentally demonstrated that environmental context&mdash;cleanliness of water&mdash;affects both the host crayfish\u00c6s grooming behavior and the population dynamics of the symbiotic worms. \n\n3)  Effects on stream ecosystem.  In perhaps our most striking result, we detected an effect of branchiobdellid worms on a stream ecosystem.  Crayfish hosting worms reduced the abundance of other invertebrate species in streams more than crayfish without worms. Crayfish with worms also reduced fine sediment levels more than crayfish without worms. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate this type of indirect effect.\n\n4) Unexpected benefits.  Several extensions of our w..."
