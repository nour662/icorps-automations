This award funds a series of research-oriented conferences and workshops combined with informal research activities and learning opportunities for scholars new to game theory.\r\n\r\nThe summer conference and workshops bring together a large and international group of researchers including many junior faculty and graduate students.  Their interests represent a diverse array of theoretical and applied game theory.  Specific topics include Predictive and Descriptive Game Theory, Auctions, Innovations, Adaptive Learning, Game Theoretic Approaches to Electoral Laws, Large Games,  Game Theory for Counterterrorism, Cooperative Game Theory, Macroeconomic Applications of Game Theory, Reputations, Correlated Equilibrium, and Game Theory in Computer Science.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include training graduate students in state-of-the-art approaches to game theory and facilitating the development of game theory concepts that are useful for a wide range of disciplines.",
