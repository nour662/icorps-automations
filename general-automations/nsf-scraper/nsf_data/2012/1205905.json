 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of the project are to calculate corrections in support of experiments such as parity violating electron scattering that are searching for signals of physics beyond the standard model; to calculate accurately electromagnetic corrections to nucleon masses accounting for all we have learned about nucleon structure in recent times; to study potential nuclear physics applications of twisted photon states, which are photon states that carry very high angular momentum;  to continue obtaining hadron theory results from the remarkable correspondence between the gauge theories that describe nuclear interaction in our world and theoretical models of gravity in higher dimensions; and to use nuclear physics knowledge to accurately obtain important nuclear size corrections to atomic energy splittings.\r\n\r\nThese projects will help bridge the gap between the theory of hadrons (particles that interact via the strong, or nuclear, force) and observed phenomena, and lead to greater understanding of the mechanisms of hadronic reactions.  One project will also connect to another field, the field of atomic physics.  They will also train new students, including undergraduates.  The PI has had  two successful women Ph. D. students, and the present project may extend opportunities for women entering the field.  The PI is regularly at the Jefferson Laboratory and bridging the gap between university and national lab as well as between data and theory.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMuch of the work supported by this grant is centered on the proton radius puzzle, the observation that measurements of the proton radius using electrons as a tool gives a different result than measurements using muons.  The most exciting idea here is that the difference may be due to a hitherto undiscovered beyond the standard model (BSM) force that affect muons differently than electrons.  This  possibility is still open, and aspects of it have been studied by the PI in collaboration with two different graduate students, showing how the possibility could be confirmed or definitely falsified in high statistics K-decay experiments, and showing how a fuller view of the BSM interactions within a renormalizable theory would necessarily ameliorate some problems that had been pointed out by others.   \n      Also pursuing a different and not BSM possibility, the PI working with an undergraduate and another faculty colleague has shown how a more targeted analysis of the results of bouncing electrons off a proton target would lead to a smaller, and in line with the muon based value, proton radius and offered some comments on how an excessively complicated albeit more global fit to broadest available swath of data could give a less reliable result for the item of most interest.  Additionally, at a more basic level, some of the standard model theory corrections used in the analysis of the muonic experiments are based on the PI's work, with collaborators.  \n      The PI, with collaboration from a graduate student, also worked on corrections to the QWeak experiment, an experiment which measures electron polarization dependence of the electron proton scattering rate, motivated by searching for BSM effects.  The early theory underlying this experiment neglected some corrections that have since proved to be twice the size of the anticipated uncertainty limits of the experiment.  The PI and the graduate student were important among those that worked to verify the existence of these corrections and ensure that they were known to the accuracy needed.\n      There has also been work on twisted or vortex photons, which are photons that carry angular momenta that can be very high even when projected in the direction of motion.  These can be used to selectively and exclusively excite final states that have high angular momenta, and we have studied reaction rates for such processes, both when the target nuclei or atoms are exactly on the axis of the vortex and when the targets are off axis. \n      One aspect of the broader impact is the cross disciplinary nature of much of the work.  The studies of the proton radius puzzle involves experiments and, for the PI, calculations that involve and are relevant for both atomic and hadronic nuclear physics.  Work by the PI on proton structure corrections to the  ordinary hydrogen and muonic ground state hyperfine splitting is of renewed interest as results from the JLab experiment on the second proton spin-dependent structure function become available soon.  The work involving twisted photons began because of anticipated applications, also involving twisted electrons, at Jefferson Lab and has tested some of the ideas with applications in the direction of optical and atomic phenomena.  \n      Further, the broader impact is felt in the training of both undergraduate and graduate students to do research, and to teach the subject of physics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/10/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carl E Carlson"
