 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to increase student participation at Symposium J ?Organic and Hybrid Organic Electronics? to be held at the 2012 MRS Spring Meeting. Funds will be used to enable young American scientists in training to attend an international conference by means of financial assistance to travel and registrations fees.  \r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed Symposium consists in the development of a detailed understanding of correlations between chemical structure and associated molecular properties (such as electronic and spectroscopic properties, solubility, miscibility or chemical reactivity) and characteristics of devices in which the investigated compounds are used. Examples include the selection of pairs of specific fullerene derivatives and polymers and the characteristics of resulting solar cells and photodetectors while developing scalable device fabrication methodology or the use of bulk quantities of exclusively semi-conducting carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) in thin-film transistors. The proposed symposium is expected to lead to transformative design approaches allowing for the systematic engineering of new materials best suitable to be used in specific devices, improved predictive capabilities of computational techniques and better materials as well as device metrology.  \r\nThe broader impact includes the significantly accelerated commercial development of organic and hybrid electronics. Communication between scientists with different backgrounds, critical for the industrial success of newly developed devices will be facilitated. Manufacturing of electronic devices with yet unmet characteristics, for instance on flexible substrates, will be enabled. Participation of women and representatives from underrepresented minorities will be particularly encouraged.",
