 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Charles B. Harris of the University of California, Berkeley and his research group will use ultrafast one- and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopies to study the dynamics of electronic states in organometallic systems.  This work builds upon the group's extensive experience and will explore the ways in which electronic transitions and transfers, both photochemically-induced and at thermal equilibrium, dictate the reactivity of organometallic complexes for catalytically-relevant systems. These experiments will improve the current understanding of intramolecular electron transfer in the context of molecular-scale devices, clarify the role of spin state changes and external heavy atom effects on reaction dynamics, and elucidate the dynamics of novel CO2 reduction catalysts. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy provides the perfect tool for developing a deep understanding of these important classes of reactions.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this research will benefit from a multi-faceted approach involving not only experimental molecular spectroscopy, but also synthesis and theory. This environment is supplemented by collaborations with faculty at other institutions. Students (both graduate and undergraduate) will benefit from this multi-disciplinary research setting. Finally, the Harris group is engaged in a variety of community outreach and education activities that promote a broader public understanding and appreciation for chemistry and science in general.",
