 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in July 2013 at the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile in Santiago, Chile.  Organized by Dr. Alice E. Smith, Professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering and Dr. Jorge  F. Valenzuela, Professor and Chair of Industrial and Systems Engineering, both at Auburn University, the institute will focus on the transport and distribution of manufactured goods to customers, known as physical distribution systems.  Managing distribution systems in globalized business environments is challenging due to the increasing complexity of production systems and supply networks, traditional efficiency concerns, quality, storage and transport aspects, and holistic approaches involving sustainability, security, and human factors.  Thus, the modeling and design of physical distribution systems require a mastery of cutting edge technical tools and understanding of new approaches to design and operation.  The PASI will provide participants with educational modules on various aspects of physical distribution systems, with an emphasis on multinational distribution systems at both the micro and macro levels.  The micro level addresses such topics as warehousing, material handling, and facility layout while the macro level refers to facility location, supply networks, routing optimization, and collaborative logistics.\r\n\r\nThis PASI brings together outstanding scholars and students from throughout the Americas to learn about many technical facets involved with complex distribution systems.  It encompasses traditional small classroom experiences, hands-on group projects taken from actual distribution systems, and intensive field experiences.  Knowledge will be disseminated widely through first hand contacts and through an open access web page of all educational materials and project outcomes.  As such, it will benefit many other students and early career researchers in the fields of industrial engineering, systems engineering, operations research, operations management, applied mathematics and logistics.  Additionally, the PASI will promote sustainable international collaborations among senior and junior researchers of different countries and regions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n    \n\n \nThis project funded a two week study institute on physical distribution systems for researchers and educators across the Americas.  The goals were to further the technical and professional development of young researchers and educators, stimulate interaction and collaboration amongst universities in the Americas and across senior and junior academics, and to result in new international collaborations and creative lines of research.  \nThere were educational modules on specific topics led by the top experts in the field complemented by two intense field experiences unique to Chile.  One field experience was visiting the largest wine company in Chile and the other took place at the active Port of Valparaiso.  The educational modules were : Trends in Supply Chain Strategies Meet Material Handling Realities, Advances in Distribution Center Design, Collaborative Logistics for Increased Efficiency, Reduced Distribution Costs, and Increased Sustainability, Designing Order Fulfillment Systems, Unit Load Warehouses Management, Configuration, and Design, Modeling and Analysis of Picking Systems Using Simio, The Application of Six-Sigma DMAIC to Distribution Systems, Exploiting Network Structures on Transportation and Logistics Problems, On the Transformative Impact of the Physical Internet on Distribution Systems, A Collaborative Supply Chain Management System for a Maritime Port Logistics Chain, Designing Sustainable Pallet Handling Operations, Integrated Consolidation Facility Location and Inventory Routing for Supply Networks, Self-Organizing Logistics Systems, Distribution Systems for the Textile Industry, Engineering Design of Warehouses and Logistics Networks, A Strategic Empty Container Logistics Optimization in a Major Shipping Company, Chilean Foreign Trade Logistics Development Agenda and Initiating and Sustaining International Collaborations.\nIn total, 39 people attended the study institute representing seven countries.  In the nine months since the PASI in August 2013, 39 post-workshop collaborations between participants have resulted representing 21 academic institutions.

I would have never met this group of people in any other fashion or form. My future boss, collaborators, colleagues, coworkers, and friends are from this event. The educational sessions alone have helped my research exceed past my previous expectations.\"\n\"This workshop certainly achieved or exceeded its aims. The selection of participants and lecturers was world class. I have already invited or will invite several participants to make guest lectures at my home university.
