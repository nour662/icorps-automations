 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAlternating copolymers of functional stilbene monomers with maleic anhydride or maleimides are new sterically crowded, chain stiffened, and precisely functionalized macromolecules.  The recently established semi-flexible nature of these backbones, arising from the steric crowding of the 1,2-diphenyl  groups from the stilbene monomers and the stiffening effect of five-member cyclic anhydride or imide units is the origin of interesting optical, surface area, and block copolymer solution complexation behavior exhibited by these materials.  One thrust of the research in this project will focus on the solution properties, including rheology and self-assembly characteristics, of these semi-flexible polymers in organic solvents (non-ionic copolymers) and in aqueous media (ionic copolymers).  The properties of interpolyelectrolyte complexes (IPECs) of small libraries of new all anionic and all cationic semi-flexible macromolecules under various external stimuli such as salt concentration and pH will be studied and the effect of charge density, placement, and chain stiffness on the IPECs elucidated using dynamic light scattering and other techniques.   In addition, the effect of charge density and charge type on the aqueous solution behavior of self assembled complexes of new double hydrophilic block copolymers, containing a semi-flexible alternating copolymer block, will be investigated.   A second thrust will involve studies of the effect of the semi-flexible contorted alternating copolymer structures on polymer properties such as surface area, gas permeability, and adsorbent properties in the solid state.  New hybrid block copolymers based on poly(arylene ether sulfone) middle blocks will be synthesized with alternating copolymer end blocks and will be cast into films and the mechanical, morphological, and gas permeability properties studied.  The nanoporous properties of hypercrosslinked polymer particles, containing semi-flexible alternating structures with selected types of functional groups, will be studied using a nitrogen adsorption method.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nMany technologies that are critical for the health, sustainability, and security of our society are dependent on the discovery and development of new polymeric materials that enable various types of devices in the optical and electronic areas to function or that can deliver payloads of therapeutics across biological membranes.   The new polymeric materials resulting from the fundamental studies of this grant have potential for applications in a number of areas where enabling polymeric materials are indispensable components in successful innovations to products.  Potential applications range from high surface area polymers for adsorbents for gases such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide, new water soluble polymers with tailored stimuli responsiveness for biomedical processes, and new hybrid polymer membranes for gas separations.  Results from this research will be presented at major conferences and published in leading journals.  Graduate students involved in this project will master the fundamentals of polymer science and engineering and will learn to work in a fast-paced interdisciplinary environment.  These graduate students will have the opportunity to mentor undergraduate students in an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates program at Virginia Tech and interact with industrial researchers in numerous outreach programs from the Virginia Tech polymer community.  Participation in this research will provide students with a well-rounded education platform for preparation for successful careers in the science and technology based enterprise of our nation",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe properties of polymer chains with a methylene backbone are dependent on the chemical nature and size of the pendant groups on the chain.  For example, the polymer chain with an unsubstituted methylene backbone is polyethylene (I) (see images for structures), a low glass transition temperature semicrystalline polymer which is the highest volume commercial polymer produced today.  Polyethylene is ubiquitous in flexible packaging and other applications.  Substituting two of the hydrogen atoms on one of the the methylene backbone carbon atoms with a methyl group and a methy ester group yields poly(methyl methacrylate) (II) which is a high glass transition temperature amorphous plastic primarily used as a transparent plastic replacement for glass.\n\nThe fundamental understandings developed since the 1930's of the relationship of macromolecular structure and properties enabled the introduction of new polymeric materials into commercethat have revolutionized modern technologies ranging from aerospace, telecommunications, and food packaging to biomedical and drug delivery.  Our NSF sponsored research seeks to expand our knowledge of structure/property relationships in polymer chains by studying the effect of systematic chain stiffening of an all-carbon polymer chain by inserting sterically congested groups appended to the backbone with the goal of understanding the basic solution and solid state properties of these modifications of the chain.  Our investigations have revealed that significant property changes occur, when we incorporate sterically bulky adjacent groups from 1,2-disubstituted stilbene monomers copolymerized with maleic anhydride or a substituted maleimide into the backbone.  These chain stiffening alternating comonomer sequences lead to new materials with potentially useful applications such as for gas sorbent particles, optical films, novel salt responsive solution properties, and highly active antimicrobial materials.  In this reporting period, we have studied the incorporation of chain stiffening alternating sequences based on protected dicarboxylic acid stilbene monomer and maleic anhydride into divinyl benzene crosslinked hydrogel particles.  After deprotection, these polymer particles have highly carboxylic acid functionalized chain stiffened units in the backbone (III).  We have incorporated these chain stiffened carboxylic acid functional groups into microgel particles using a miniemulsion polymerization technique that yields hydrogel nanoparticles in the size range of 140-160 nm.  Since this is a polymer particle with a high level of carboxylic acid groups, the size of the hydrogel nanoparticles is pH dependent--contracts at low pH and expands at high pH where the backbone has charged carboxylic acid salts. We are currently studying the absorption of heavy metal ions such as lead and copper onto examples of these new microgel nanoparticles.
