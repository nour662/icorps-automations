 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project considers using a variety of sensors to monitor an unknown signal field over a spatial domain with unknown geometry, which may bear elevational variations. The main objective of this project is to develop mathematical algorithms that can integrate sensor readings from a large number of distributed devices and reconstruct both the signal field and the terrain. Specifically, the sensors involved in the project include the Light Detection And Ranging technology (LIDAR) and networked wireless sensors, for their complementary capabilities. LIDAR uses a constant number of powerful sensors, each takes an image  from a distance. On the other hand, distributed wireless sensors use a large number of inexpensive sensors (possibly piggybacking on cellular phones), each takes a density reading at its position. The approach in this project is to use  conformal and hyperbolic geometry, discrete curvature flows, topology and numerical analysis to develop novel algorithms to generate accurate density map. From the networking perspective, this project addresses the problems of LIDAR image fusion, network localization, sensor deployment, and integration of LIDAR and sensor data. \r\n \r\nThe project is motivated by the potentially devastating chemical terror attacks. Biological and chemical agents, used by adversaries, could potentially spread to a large region in a short time. This project focuses on development of algorithmic tools and techniques for gathering timely, accurate and useful information about the chemical or biological spread in case of such an attack. By exploiting the geometric properties of LIDAR data and sensor network data, the project provides critical observations on fundamental questions of how to organize such a large scale network; how to manage sensor data; and how to use the network for acting on the environment and the users.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project is collaborative with two computer scientists Jie Gao and David Gu.  The PI?s work is on the mathematical foundation of the proposal.  One of the main mathematical problems is to develop algorithmic tools for computing the uniformization maps.   About one hundred years ago, Henri Poincare and Paul Koebe independently proved the uniformization theorem for surfaces.  This is one of the most important results in surface geometry.  The uniformization theorem implies, for instance, each human face can be flattened to the round unit disk such that flattening process preserves angles (mathematically called conformal). However, over the years, no one has seen the actual picture of a flattened human face.  This is the mathematical task that the PI?s proposed to solve.  The outcome of the proposal produces an algorithm which computes, among other things, the flattened surfaces.   A flattened human face is shown the report.  Poincare-Koebe theorem holds for all surfaces in the 3-dimensional space without holes (mathematically called simply connected).  For instance,  surfaces of  human brains are simply connected and can be uniformized by Poincare-Koebe theorem. \n\nThe mathematics that PI?s developed is based on the polyhedral surfaces. These are the surfaces which are gluing of triangles.  A notion of discrete conformal equivalence between polyhedral surfaces is introduced.  It is showed that within each discrete conformal class of a polyhedral surface there exists a unique (up to scaling) representative of constant discrete curvature.  This is a discrete version of the Poincare-Koebe theorem.  The recent work of PI also shows that the discrete conformality approximates the smooth conformality if one takes fine subdivision meshes.  This theoretically guarantees that PI?s algorithm converges and the pictures shown are real approximation to the Poincare-Koebe uniformization maps. \n\nPotential applications of PI?s algorithm include medical imaging  (e.g., colon flattening) and biological sciences.  Other potential applications include classification of 3-D scanned figures according to their discrete conformal properties.\n\nWith the generous support of the NSF grant,  four graduate students at Rutgers under the supervision of the PI have defended their Ph.D. thesis and have successfully landed their first positions in academic. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Feng Luo"
