 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project comprises the first large-scale airborne experiment focused on mercury over North America. The project has two primary objectives: 1) Constrain emissions of mercury from major source regions in the eastern United States, 2) Quantify the distribution and chemical transformations of mercury in the lower troposphere. To address these goals the NSF/National Center for Atmsopheric Research C-130 aircraft will be equipped with a suite of state-of-the-art instrumentation to measure gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), particle-bound Hg (pHg) and a suite of other compounds for air mass characterization. Flight plans will be designed to study industrial mercury sources over the Ohio River Valley, outflow of North American mercury to the Atlantic, and the impact of convective precipitation on surface wet deposition of mercury over the Southeast U.S. Operational planning will utilize regional and global forecast models to optimize the use of flight time. The C-130 observations will be integrated and analyzed after the mission with several chemical transport and Lagrangian models. These models will be used to examine the consistency between observations and emission inventories, allow the integration of ground-based observations with aircraft observations in a unified framework, constrain source-receptor relationships, and test different hypotheses about the chemical transformations and global cycling of mercury.\r\n\r\nHuman exposure to mercury is a significant health risk and a problem of national and global significance. Project results will reduce the uncertainties concerning source-receptor relationships and the relative contributions of domestic, foreign and natural sources to the inventory of atmospheric mercury over the eastern U.S. The research will involve a number of graduate and undergraduate students from several different U.S. institutions and thus will expose these students to working on high-level scientific problems of great national significance. In addition to a core group of scientists from the U.S., mercury scientists from Canada, Italy, Germany and Russia will also collaborate in the work, thus strengthening international scientific cooperation on global environmental problems.",

Mercury and Aerosol Distributions, Sources and Sinks) scientific study in the summer of 2013. &nbsp;The instrument used to make these measuremements was a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) that was staged on the NSF/NCAR C-130 research aircraft. &nbsp;A CIMS instrument is used to measure atmospheric components by producing ions (molecules with a negative or positive charge) whose abundance is related to the atmospheric amount of the molecules or free radicals of interest. &nbsp;We measured OH (hydroxyl radicsl), HO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(hydroperoxy radicsl), HO<sub>2+</sub>RO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(sum of HO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and organic peroxy radicsl), H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;(sulfuric acid)<sub>,</sub>SCI (stablized Criegee intermediates), and MSA (methane sulfonic acid) during NOMADSS at time periods of 30 to 60 seconds.</p>\n<p>The data have been used for a variety of scientific purposes. &nbsp;For example, hydroxyl radicals are important in the oxidation of many species including oxidized (reactive) mercury and isoprene. &nbsp;Peroxy radicals are key in understanding the budget of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) which is produced in polluted environments from the interaction of sunlight with oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds. &nbsp;Hydroxyl radicals also oxidize sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) to produce&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. &nbsp;SCI is the sum of reactive compounds produced when O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;reacts with alkenes (organic compounds with one or more double bonds). &nbsp;SCI species also react with SO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and other molecules, but its importance depends on its concentration that is affected by other reactions including reaction with water vapor, decomposition, and photolysis by sunlight.. &nbsp;Data from NOMADSS indicate that SCI can be very important in the removal of various atmospheric components.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;One of the goals of NOMADSS was to better understand the emission of isoprene and other biogenic organic compounds emitted from trees and plants. &nbsp;These studies were conducted with racetrack patterns (Figure 1) at different altitudes with high speed (1 per second or faster) measurements of isoprene concentration, and vertical wind speed and direction. &nbsp;Since other measurements were made during these racetracks, studies of the evolution of various gases (e.g. isoprene, NO<sub>x</sub>) can be evaluated as air masses move downwind. &nbsp;Figure 2 shows the evolutionn of a number of species during measurements on Flight #17. &nbsp;Notice that some species (e.g. isoprene) build up with time (i.e. the flux from the surface is faster than the removal in the atmosphere), while others decay with time (e..g carbon monoxide (CO), NO<sub>x</sub>) because the the loss in the atmosphere is greater than the flux from the surface. &nbsp;Due to interaction with atmospheric composition, free radical species also change as the air moves downwind. &nbsp;An analysis of isoprene during this racetrack indicates that the observations agree with a calculation constrained by concentrations of OH, and with the surface flux as an adjustable parameter. &nbsp;This calculation (Figure 3) yields a flux of 7 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/hr which is significantly higher than the 2-4&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/hr that was measured. &nbsp;Calculations are to be done with several other racetrack patterns in different locations to verify this result.</p>\n<p>In another apsect of NOMADSS, nitrous acid (HONO) was measured over the Atlantic Ocean to the east of the North Carolina coast. &nbsp;The budget of HONO involves concentrations of OH (formation from OH+NO, and loss from OH+HONO). &nbsp;This analysis showed that one or more additional sources are needed to balance the budget. &nbsp;Using our measurements of OH and other observations, the NOMADSS team concluded that photolysis of nitrate within particles was an important HONO source. &nbsp;If verifiied, this result demonstrates the significant importance of HONO as an OH precusor, since photolysis of HONO by sunlight produces OH and NO.</p>\n<p>In summary, we measured several species that are important in the atmospheric chemistry of the southeast United States. &nbsp;These observations have been used to verify various aspects of atmospheric chemistry, including the importance of alternate HONO sources, quantifying the abundance of SCI, quantifying the role of OH as a reactant in the budgets of mercury and isoprene, and testing known aspects of atmopsheric chemistry as air moves downwind in the racetrack studies. &nbsp;We have modeled the concentrations of several species that were measured (and some that were not), that allows us to understand the details of, for example, free radical production and loss. &nbsp;Analysis of these data continues, and will lead to additional scienfic publications of important findings.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t
