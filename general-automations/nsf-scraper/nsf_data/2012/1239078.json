 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to test the hypothesis that micro- and meso-scale structures of solid carriers enhance attachment of algae.  Such structures (for example, dimples or channels) will be fabricated on the surface of solid carriers -- the major equipment proposed for manufacturing algae biofuels in the ocean.  The approach includes an experimental study of cell attachment to structured carriers, physics-based modeling of cell-carrier interactions, and prediction of the effect of carrier structures on algae attachment using the surface element integration technique.  The educational objective of this proposal is to impart a system-level integration of a manufacturing-education-enhancement based theme at high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels.  This will be accomplished through exposure of undergraduate and graduate students to interdisciplinary research projects, K-12 outreach through existing outreach programs, course and curriculum development in energy manufacturing, and involvement of women and minorities through mentoring programs at Kansas State University.\r\n\r\nKnowledge obtained from this research will foster design and manufacturing of solid carriers to help realize the vision of affordable bio-based energy manufacturing.  Economically viable manufacturing of algae biofuels will greatly benefit the economy and energy security, as well as society and the environment of the United States.  Success of the proposed activities will help expand the role of the manufacturing research community to create a new, trillion dollar energy manufacturing industry in the United States.  The interdisciplinary research will benefit engineering education at Kansas State University.  Students will be exposed to two very distinct research fields -- algae molecular biology and manufacturing processes.  Research results will be disseminated through journal articles, conferences, workshops, and summer programs.",
