 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cryptography provides a means of securing communications and authentication, e.g., between you and a bank, which has great utility in everyday life in both the physical and virtual world. An important underlying principle in cryptography is that an attacker must perform disproportionately more work than a legitimate user to achieve access to a resource. However, the threat of online fraud and the insecurity of weak passwords have grown to become a serious problem. This project will study methods for building secure, physical token-based systems from self-assembled nanostructures that are physically unclonable, yet practical for use in protecting digital communications channels. The goal of this research is to understand the fundamental science behind the operation of these devices and how to engineer more secure cyber-physical systems.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project includes three aspects: (1) the development of system-level modeling tools, (2) exploration of various approaches for informal science education based on the theme of self-assembly and cryptography, and (3) several supplemental lecture modules at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate level on this subject enhanced by recent research results.",

This shift is primarily driven by the ability to derive a unique, unforgeable signature from a physical key. The sole demonstration of an unforgeable key, thus far, has been through quantum key distribution, which suffers from limited communication distances and expensive infrastructure requirements. This project has shown a method for creating unclonable keys by molecular self-assembly of resonance energy transfer (RET) devices. It is infeasible to clone the RET-key due to the inability to characterize the key using current technology, the large number of input-output combinations per key, and the variation of the key&rsquo;s response with time. However, the manufacturer can produce multiple identical devices, which enables inexpensive, secure authentication and communication over classical channels, and thus any distance. Through a detailed experimental survey of the nanoscale keys, we demonstrated that legitimate users are successfully authenticated 99.48% of the time and the false-positives are only 0.39%, over two attempts. We estimate that a legitimate user would have a computational advantage of more than 10<sup>340</sup> years over an attacker. Our method enables the discovery of a new class of physical key based multi-party authentication and communication schemes that are both practical and possess unprecedented security.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/28/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Chris&nbsp;L&nbsp;Dwyer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1217866/1217866_10179842_1443455223920_fig2_lowres--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1217866/1217866_10179842_1443455223920_fig2_lowres--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"System overview\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1217866/1217866_10179842_1443455223920_fig2_lowres--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"System overview\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A typical use case for a physical RET key for sending secure information over an open channel.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nellore</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chris&nbsp;L&nbsp;Dwyer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">System overview</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1217866/1217866_10179842_1443455070288_storage_cell_zoom_v1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1217866/1217866_10179842_1443455070288_storage_cell_zoom_v1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Self-assembled RET-keys\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1217866/1217866_10179842_1443455070288_storage_cell_zoom_v1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Self-assembled RET-keys\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic representation of a collection of self-assembled RET keys</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dwyer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chris&nbsp;L&nbsp;Dwyer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Self-assembled RET-keys</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
