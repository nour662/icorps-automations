 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a three year standard award for a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site Program at the University of South Florida (USF) entitled, RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site-Water Awareness Research and Education (RET-WARE), under the direction of Dr. Maya Trotz. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this three year RET is to provide a proactive and well structured research, education and professional development experience for at least 44 middle and high school science and math teachers from the Hillsborough County Public Schools and pre-service teachers from USF's College of Education.  The research theme is framed around three of the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges (i.e. management of the nitrogen cycle, provision of clean water, and urban infrastructure improvement) and the role of formal and informal science education in integrating marginalized, coastal community participants in developing solutions to these grand challenges while broadening participation in STEM fields. RET participants will interact with faculty mentors and their research group in the Colleges of Engineering and Arts and Sciences at USF through individual summer research projects, research seminars, social and community activities, professional training sessions, and online media linked to the RET website.  The RET program will be integrated with 1) two USF courses (Development of Technology-Based Instruction and Engineering Engagement: Beyond the lab and the Drawing Board), 2) an ongoing project of the USF Engineers for a Sustainable World student chapter (WARE in East Tampa, an Environmental Protection Agency People Prosperity Planet Phase II award winner in 2009), and 3) ongoing faculty research and graduate training to ensure year long teacher support in local area schools and communities, especially those marginalized by high percentages of poverty and English as a second language barriers. \r\n\r\nThe target audience includes teachers from historically underrepresented groups in the STEM disciplines and those who teach in schools characterized by a high level of poverty and a high percentage of minority and English language learners. Therefore, the project is likely to increase the exposure to and engagement in STEM research by underserved students. The program will benefit from a strong infrastructure of K-12 education and outreach programs already in place at USF (e.g., Engineering EXPO, Tampa Interdisciplinary Environmental Research REU). A unique feature of this proposed RET site is the emphasis on community engagement, as well as partnerships with companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies which provides an opportunity for participating teachers and their students to learn how STEM is applied to solving important problems within societal, political and economic contexts.",
