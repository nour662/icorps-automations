 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-baseline arrays of radio telescopes operating as interferometers can produce images of remarkably high spatial resolution and dynamic range, but it is in general a computationally demanding task.  One step in particular, the formation of cross-correlations between each pair of telescopes in the array to give visibilities, has an imposing scaling behavior with number of telescopes N, increasing as the square of that number.  Other steps in the signal processing chain scale only in proportion to the number of telescopes, and so tend to be computationally much cheaper.   The correlation step therefore dominates as arrays grow in number of telescopes, which is precisely the trend for many current and planned instruments.  Despite vast increases in the power of modern computers, the correlator electronics for very large interferometer arrays are projected to be very expensive and consume vast amounts of electrical power.\r\n\r\nA potential breakthrough in computational efficiency for interferometer data processing is being investigated by Dr. M. Morales of the University of Washington and coworkers.  The approach replaces the classic correlation step by a spatial Fourier transform, and precedes this with a gridding operation that puts the data on regular spacings, thereby allowing the use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  As is well known, the FFT computational speed scales as N ln(N), and therefore represents a substantial computational savings over N-squared when the number of telescopes is large.  Gridding and other computational operations introduced to precondition the problem are only linear in N, so the overall imaging computation for an interferometer with many elements should be reduced, perhaps dramatically.\r\n\r\nThe new, faster correlator architecture will be explored with laboratory prototypes that build on FPGA (Floating Point Gate Array) firmware running on standard radio-astronomy computational hardware.  The culmination of this effort is intended to be a fully parallelized end-to-end demonstration unit operating on actual sky data from the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) and the Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of Re-ionization (PAPER) radio astronomical arrays.

This paradigm shift places enormous pressure on a radio telescope's computational subsystems and motivates a fundamentally new approach to the digital processing performed by its correlator.   A correlator is a radio telescope's equivalent of a camera.  It is used to produce images from the telescope's raw data.\n\nThis project developed and validated the foundational algorithms for a new correlator architecture that is able to more efficiently scale to very large radio telescopes.  There were three major results from this project: \n\n1.  We completed a software implementation of our algorithm in the Python programming package.  Our software code is called the E-field Parallel Imaging Correlator (EPIC).   We have released our EPIC code as open source software at: https://github.com/nithyanandan/EPIC.  One scientific journal article describing our EPIC software code has been submitted for journal review as of the end-date of the project (http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08318).  We also completed a reference implementation of our algorithm on an FPGA. \n\n2. We successfully used EPIC to demonstration end-to-end imaging using our alogirthm applied to real radio telescope data from the Long Wavelength Array (LWA).  \n\n3.
