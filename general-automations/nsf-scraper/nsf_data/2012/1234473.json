 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nThe Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES)  is designed to evaluate the role of isopycnal (mostly horizontal) mixing along the steeply tilted density surfaces of the Southern Ocean, and at the same time to determine the magnitude of diapycnal (mostly vertical) mixing processes that have the potential to transform water properties at mid-depth. Together these two processes are key contributors to the global meridional overturning circulation. DIMES carried out an extensive sampling program including acoustically-tracked sub-surface floats, a mid-depth tracer release, a mooring array and water property surveys. Now that the bulk of DIMES data collection has taken place, the objective of this project is to make optimal use of the DIMES observations by employing them as constraints for an ocean general circulation model, the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE), which is run using a 4-dimendional variational data assimilation technique. SOSE will provide best estimates of the background conditions in the DIMES research domain, which is vital for the DIMES float and tracer analysis. SOSE fields will be closely compared with DIMES and other independent observations to provide an assessment of uncertainties in SOSE, as well as uncertainties in the DIMES observations and in its derived estimates of Lagrangian mixing. SOSE fields will reveal the details of isopycnal mixing and oceanic heat transport in the DIMES domain and throughout the Southern Ocean. Lessons learned in the DIMES domain about isopycnal mixing will be extended to the entire Southern Ocean to evaluate spatial variations in isopycnal mixing and its sensitivity to local bathymetry, wind, and buoyancy forcing. SOSE fields will also be analyzed to evaluate the strength of meridional overturning circulation, and to assess poleward heat transport across the ACC and towards the climatically sensitive ice shelves surrounding Antarctica.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nResearch conducted for this project using SOSE will contribute to the broader multi-institution, multi-PI efforts to interpret data collected as part of DIMES, with the ultimate goal of developing a better understanding of along-isopycnal and diapycnal mixing processes in the ocean. Output from SOSE will to be made publicly available to be used for analysis by DIMES-affiliated research groups and by other interested researchers. The state estimate setup (forward and adjoint model) will be at the DIMES research groups' disposal for additional runs in support of their science goals. Results from DIMES will ultimately lead to better physical understanding of these mixing processes and suggest improvements in the mixing parameterizations of numerical models used for future climate projections. In addition, the project will contribute to the training of one graduate student who currently holds a NASA Earth System Science graduate fellowship and will provide support for a post-doctoral researcher, who will develop his skills in assimilation and model analysis.\r\n\r\nThis project is a contribution to the U.S. CLIVAR (Climate Variability and Predictability) Program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the ocean, water preferentially mixes along surfaces of constant density, which are referred to as isopycnals.  The processes that govern the structure and vigor of along-isopycnal mixing have been difficult to quantify, though results from the early 1990s demonstrated that ocean circulation is sensitive to the exact details of this mixing.  The Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES) was conceived to evaluate the physical processes governing along-isopycnal mixing as well as their counterpart, mixing between isopycnals, known as diapycnal mixing.  The DIMES effort included extensive observations, as well as numerical simulations to model mixing processes.  This research project, which was part of the analysis phase of DIMES, combined observations and numerical simulations to produce an ocean state estimate. Constraining the model with data helps ensure that the simulation provides the best possible match to the true ocean circulation.\n\nA major feature of the Southern Ocean is the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), which is defined by multiple narrow jets, each coinciding with steeply tilted isopycnal surfaces.  Since water preferentially moves along isopycnal surfaces, the ACC can serve as a barrier to exchange between the subtropical and subpolar oceans.  Water that moves poleward within the ACC is expected to move upward along isopycnals toward the ocean surface, and thus could be blocked from crossing the ACC.  A major goal of our effort was to analyze the mixing processes that occur in the Southern Ocean that allow water to move along and across the steeply tilted density surfaces that define the ACC.  By simulating numerical dye and particle releases in our model, we tracked the motions of water across the ACC.\n\nResults showed that much of the southward transport is concentrated in a few specific hot spots, and that the circulation itself is strongly influenced by the presence of bathymetry.  Numerical simulations have been able to emulate the behavior of a dye-like tracer that was released in the Southern Ocean as part of the DIMES field work, and results suggest that the dispersion of tracer is also strongly influenced by topography.\n\nWe extended our work in a number of ways, for example, by examining processes analogous to the cross-ACC mixing in other large current systems. We also explored mechanisms driving transport across the Antarctic continental shelf toward the Antarctic ice shelf.  Extensive analysis of particles released in the model informed property pathways and history, as well as the behavior of instruments deployed in the ocean and drifting with ocean currents.\n\nThis work has increased understanding of pathways of the Southern Ocean circulation and the mechanisms governing this transport. The evolution of water properties along these pathways has also been made mode clear. This knowledge informs how we should observe and model the ocean.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sarah T Gille"
