 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computational Thinking-Enabled STEM Professionals' Workshop (CTSTEM-PW) is a collaboration between Education Development Center (EDC), the New Mexico Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (NM-EPSCoR),  Intel Corporation, Los Alamos National Laboratory, the University of New Mexico, and Navajo Technical College.  It is a six-month project with two phases: (1) a workshop-planning phase, in which the project team will collaborate with key stakeholders in industry, government and academia, to adapt and apply workforce-development tools for identifying computational-thinking needs in the workplace and for assessing the alignment between those needs and available educational offerings; and (2) a workshop to share the findings from phase 1 with a group of undergraduate students from Tribal Colleges and Hispanic Serving Institutions, and to assist those students in planning for careers as CT-enabled STEM (CTSTEM) professionals.  During the workshop, undergraduate students will become familiar with the major job responsibilities and work activities of CTSTEM professionals. They will also identify the courses and work-based learning opportunities available to prepare for those careers, and will develop a career plan laying out CT learning goals, necessary educational activities, and a timeline for achieving targeted objectives.\r\n\r\nIn short, the CTSTEM-PW project will refine and test an innovative workshop format for helping undergraduate students from disadvantaged backgrounds to launch professional careers in the emerging field of computation-enabled science and engineering.  The CTSTEM-PW project will engage key stakeholders from academia, government and industry in determining CTSTEM workforce needs, in mapping those needs onto available educational opportunities, and in translating the resulting workforce-development vision into practical career advice for a concrete group of undergraduate students.  By situating the pilot workshop in New Mexico, and by partnering simultaneously both with world-class technology leaders and with local Tribal Colleges and Hispanic Serving Institutions, the CTSTEM-PW team hopes to develop a broadly-replicable template for deepening and diversifying the pool of CTSTEM professionals in economically and socially disadvantaged communities across the nation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEDC and the Santa Fe Institute held the Student Research and Practice Symposium on Computational Thinking (CT) Saturday, December 7th, 2013 at the Santa Fe Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico (https://sites.google.com/site/ctsymposium/home).  The project had two major aims. The first was to test whether a symposium was a useful way to ignite interest and action among regional institutions of higher education and their industry partners to support pathways to careers enhanced through CT. The second was to determine if such an event was replicable.\n\nThe Symposium brought together fifty-two students, college faculty, and industry representatives to discuss current research, practices and projects involving CT, and their relationship to opportunities for internships and jobs. A highlight of the symposium was a competitive student poster session. \n\nKey Learnings:\n\nThere is a sizable gap between NM industry needs for      CT-enabled STEM professionals and NM university offerings that prepare      students for the CT-enabled STEM workforce.\nThe NM industries representatives were very interested      in knowing what students have been able to learn and do on their own (outside      of their classes).\nHosting an annual CT Symposium can serve as a      comfortable and effective way to assemble education and industry      partners to discuss key issues and to develop internships, while at the      same time promoting and celebrating student project work in CT.\n\n\nUnanticipated Outcomes: \n\nThere emerged a surge in interest in collaboration and      learning from one another amongst the parties involved.  \nFruitful interactions took place between the      Supercomputing Challenge and local industries around developing internship      opportunities for Supercomputing Challenge students and alumni. \n\n\nConclusions of the Final Evaluation Report:  \n\nThe Computational Thinking-Enabled STEM Professionals\u00c6 Workshop (CTSTEM) project has successfully built upon previously existing partnerships between computational science, industry, and education communities and provided opportunities for additional partnerships to form.  Overall, the participants\u00c6 responses indicate that the \"Computational Thinking Symposium\" was successful in accomplishing all four of the project goals.\n\n \n\nGoals and Analysis of Survey Responses:\n\n Goal 1) Establishing communication between colleges/universities and business/industry about what skills, tools, and techniques CTSTEM professionals use through the building of partnerships that attempt to understand and forge alignments between industry needs and educational opportunities available to undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM and Computing.\n\n        All members of both groups, business/industry representatives and university/college representatives, indicated they connected with others within both groups that they would like to form partnerships with.  It is expected that representatives willing to give their Saturday for this student symposium would be people that are willing to go beyond and create better learning opportunities for undergraduate/graduate students that would encourage them to be CT-enabled.\n\n Goal 2) Identifying existing opportunities within partner institutions that offer courses or training for students interested in the CTSTEM profession, as well as identify new opportunities that are needed based on the use of the gap analysis tool. \n\n        All three groups, business/industry representatives, university/college representatives, and students indicated that they learned about existing opportunities within partner institutions that offer courses or training for students interested in the CTSTEM profession.  It seemed that this was new information for many of the students as well as the university/college representatives. \n\n Goal 3) Increasing the number of students who are aware of the preparation needed to become CT-enabled professionals and encouraging a greater num..."
