 "awd_abstract_narration": "For approximately nine months of each year, the waters of arctic lakes are under ice. The PI proposes to carry out time series studies: \r\n1) to quantify physical controls on under ice thermal structure and circulation, mixing of snow melt waters, mixing during spring and fall, \r\n2) to quantify respiration rates in arctic lakes of differing morphology and on different geological substrates, and \r\n3) to illustrate the linkages and feedbacks between these physical and biogeochemical processes. \r\n\r\nMeasurements will include temperature and conductivity, meteorology, sediment temperatures, ice thickness, snow cover, and respiration with newly developed oxygen and pCO2 sensors.\r\n\r\nLakes cover nearly half the land surface area in some parts of the Arctic.  As such, they are expected to have a significant impact on the atmospheric bottom boundary layer and air-land gas exchange regionally.  This project will begin to provide the process understanding necessary to parameterize Arctic system models on regional scales.",

With this project, we took advantage of new high resolution sensors to characterize the temperatures, solute concentrations, and distributions of oxygen so critical for persistence of organisms such as fish and zooplankton.  Not surprisingly, temperatures are cold, generally between 0oC and 4oC, with the warmest temperatures near the bottom since 4oC is the temperature of maximum density of freshwater.

Similarly, the bacteria in the sediments respire organic matter, that is, material such as decaying phytoplankton or sedimented leaves that flowed in from the streams in spring and summer.  Respiration generates salts which also increase density causing downslope flow. These downward flowing currents are depleted in oxygen and enriched in CO2 such that the warmest water, highest concentrations of CO2, and water with lowest concentration of oxygen pools at depth in the lakes.   \n\nWhether the lower water column becomes depleted in oxygen, that is, anoxic, and unsuitable for fish, depends on whether any processes cause upward flows under the ice. If anoxia forms under the ice, we found that methane, a climate forcing trace gas eight times more potent than CO2, accumulates and can be mixed to the surface in the ice free period and evade to the atmosphere.\n\nOn a worldwide basis, lakes contribute significant quantities of climate forcing trace gases to the atmosphere.

To determine the extent of fish habitat, the presence of thermals under the ice which can keep phytoplankton in suspension such that they become productive with increased light and food for recently hatched zooplankton or larval fish, and the contributions of lakes to regional carbon cycles requires deciphering the mechanisms that enable upwards flow in winter, assessing how basin morphometry and wind moderate mixing in spring and fall, and quantifying controls on retention of incoming snowmelt enriched in dissolved organic carbon. It also requires quantifying turbulence, which allows oxygen to flow into lakes and climate forcing trace gases to evade.\n\nOur project has focused on these goals with analysis of existing data and by modeling using three dimensional hydrodynamic models.
