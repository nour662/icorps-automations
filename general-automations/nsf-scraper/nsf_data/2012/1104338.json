 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the magnetic conjugacy and non-conjugacy of the auroral electrojet system.  Instances of non-conjugate behavior may arise from one or more of four different reasons.  The possible reasons for non-conjugate behavior are: (1) inter-hemispherical differences in Earth's internal magnetic field, (2) differences in ionospheric conductivity due to differences in solar illumination, (3) external electric currents driven by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and (4) field-aligned currents flowing from one hemisphere to the other.  Statistical analyses of a large number of events will be used to determine under what conditions each of the possible reasons for non-conjugate behavior are operative.  The project will characterize differences and similarities in the auroral electrojet systems in the two hemispheres and will determine the dependence on season, location and IMF conditions. \r\n\r\nMost of our knowledge of the behavior of auroral phenomena comes from observations in the northern hemisphere and the common assumption is that the southern hemisphere is simply a mirror of what happens in the northern hemisphere.  Two locations, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern hemisphere are referred to a conjugate if they are connected by a magnetic field line.  Optical observations done simultaneously in both hemispheres has shown many instances of non-conjugate behavior.  This project will use magnetic field measurements taken in both hemispheres from a large number of magnetometers to examine the conditions that produce non-conjugate behavior.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAurora, the northern light, is caused by precipitation of energetic electrons along magnetic field lines in the polar region.  In general, the magnetic field lines in the auroral zone have their one footprint in the northern hemisphere and the other one in the southern hemisphere, and therefore it is widely expected that auroral phenomena are conjugate between the two hemispheres, and their sources are located near the magnetic equator in the magnetosphere, usually outside of geosynchronous orbit, which is at ~6.6 Earth radii from the center of Earth.  In this project we investigated the conjugacy of electric currents and waves between the two hemispheres and between the ionosphere and magnetosphere using ground auroral images, ground magnetic field data, and particle and electric and magnetic fields measurements made by spacecraft.\n\n1.  INTELLECTUAL MERITS\n\nThe primary scientific results of this project can be summarized as follows:\n\nAuroral beads, i.e., azimuthally arrayed bright spots resembling a pearl necklace, appeared simultaneously at conjugate ground stations in Ireland and Antarctica, suggesting that they are not driven by a process in the ionosphere, but their source is located in the magnetosphere.\nIrregular magnetic pulsations (Pi1 and Pi2) are observed as auroral beads form.  In general, conjugate ground stations observe similar Pi1 and Pi2 signatures, but we found that the timing of evolution can be slightly (~ 1min) different, which apparently reflects a similar time difference in the evolution of auroral beads.  It is therefore suggested that even though the local ionospheric condition affects the temporal development of auroral beads.\nThe comparison between ground auroral images and variations of magnetic  field and particle flux measured by one of the THEMIS spacecraft at a  conjugate point in the magnetosphere showed one-to-one correspondence  between longitudinally-propagating arc wave (LPAW) in the ionosphere and  ULF pulsations with a period of ~2 min in the plasma sheet.  This  finding suggests that the LPAW is caused by diffuse precipitation of  hard plasma sheet electrons (&gt; ~1 keV) as a consequence of  wave-particle interaction.\n\n\nWe published all these results in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\n2. OUTREACH/EDUCATION EFFORTS\n\nOur project team has a close tie with Univ. Bergen (Norway) and routinely hosted graduate students at the PI institution JHU/APL.  In addition, every summer we hosted local high-school teachers and one or two students of their science class.  Usually they worked as a team on data processing and analysis.  Some achievements were presented at annual Fall meetings of American Geophysical Union.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shin-Ichi Ohtani"
