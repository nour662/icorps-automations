 "awd_abstract_narration": "The college is continuing its 10-year commitment to encouraging students to pursue and succeed in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) academic programs. This project is serving as a catalyst to assist 58 academically talented, financially needy students each academic year in their effort to earn an associate degree either to be prepared for the workplace or to further their education at a four-year institution. In addition to the direct financial aid through scholarships, the students benefit though numerous opportunities such as collaborative learning, mentoring, tutoring, and recognition as a recipient of this prestigious designation.\r\n\r\nThe project objectives are to:\r\nA) Identify and recruit current and prospective students into STEM disciplines and the STEM Scholars Program,\r\nB) Select qualified students for the STEM Scholars Program,\r\nC) Engage STEM Scholars Program recipients in a learning community that improves the motivation and persistence of STEM scholars, and\r\nD) Evaluate the effectiveness of the STEM Scholars Program.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: College recruitment resources (e.g., printed documents, online information, and face-to-face visitations) are continually updated regarding STEM opportunities. The selection process and a scoring rubric have been refined based on lessons learned. Students are supported through diverse Student Support Services and collaboration with area employers and other supportive partners. The STEM Scholars Program recipients are responsible for ensuring they successfully complete all components of the STEM Scholar program; however, they have significant support from college faculty, staff, and administrators to stay on-track with rigorous requirements, including through STEM mentors and Student Support Services personnel. As college staff becomes more familiar with STEM programs, they become more aware of student needs and successful recruitment techniques. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The STEM Scholars Program is allowing the college to strengthen academic collaboration among students, faculty, and staff and to continue to expand and develop STEM initiatives at additional levels throughout the college. The program entails direct involvement of diverse staff in various departments, from Admissions to Student Support Services to Scholarships and Alumni. This integrated approach spreads the message about STEM careers and opportunities, now and into the future. To further their knowledge of the career fields and the knowledge of employers about STEM programs, scholarship recipients are encouraged to participate with professional societies at meetings or through activities. As a result of the advancement of the program throughout each of the five years of award, members of the team are sharing results with their respective formal academic associations. The long-term goal is to ensure the United States remains well-prepared with adequately trained STEM professionals to continue to provide the ever-changing workforce with qualified STEM candidates.",
