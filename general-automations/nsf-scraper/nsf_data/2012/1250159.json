An important goal of NABGG is to encourage students of color to pursue baccalaureate and advanced (MS and PhD) degrees in STEM fields in order to help provide a competent and diverse workforce in these economically critical areas for the 21st Century and the conference will provide an opportunity for mentoring underrepresented students in the Earth and environmental sciences. The planned conference will have wide-ranging technical programs, career success workshops for students, and interactive exhibits with appeal to professionals, students, and science educators in the Washington DC are. The theme of the conference will be Focus on Environmental Change, emphasizing innovations in geosciences that facilitate the understanding environmental change. Faculty from the University of Arkansas and University of California Museum of Paleontology will facilitate student participation at the conference.",

These professionals serve as exceptional role models and mentors for students from all academic levels, undergraduate through MS and PhD.  Students gain valuable experience networking with these professionals; a number of students each year are extended offers for summer internships and permanent employment.  The NABG recognizes the Annual Technical Conference as an ideal setting to conduct talent searches and NSF support for student participation is a critical aspect of development for the 21st Century geoscience workforce.\n\nThe Annual Technical Conference of NABG is also an important opportunity to engage the academic community involved in direct education and training of students to interact with geoscience professionals to better understand the technical skills and knowledge base required for successful employment in the 21st Century geoscience workforce.
