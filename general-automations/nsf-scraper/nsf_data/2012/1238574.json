 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of the targeted infusion project at Elizabeth City State University is to address the high rate of attrition of students from introductory biology courses.  This effort will be achieved by utilizing a holistic approach to student retention that relies on several strategies including evaluation of best practices that enhance African American student success, implementation of best practices, implementation of a pre-college initiative with targeted mentoring, a summer bridge program with a critical thinking component and online experiences as a prelude for e-learning.  All of these strategies are reinforced through a strategically developed partnership with Rutgers University that meaningfully includes learning and education program evaluation expertise, particularly as it relates to African American students.  It is envisaged that the outcomes of this project will be analyzed in terms of the ease of transferability to a research intensive institution.  In this regard, the targeted infusion project at Elizabeth City State University will not only impact the institution, but also impact non-HBCU campuses and, therefore, a broader cadre of underrepresented minority students.",
