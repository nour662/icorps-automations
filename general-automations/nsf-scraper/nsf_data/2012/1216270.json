 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Lisa Randall at Harvard University. \r\n\r\nThe next few years hold the promise of the discovery of new phenomena and particles:  at the Large Hadron Collider, in dark-matter experiments, and in precision tests of flavor and the electroweak sector.  Professor Randall's research will focus on LHC and dark-matter model building. Professor Randall will also continue to address theoretical issues related to predictions from various theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. \r\n\r\nThe high-energy physics community has also been seeing that the new physics effects or new exotic phenomena might be at the edge of what is kinematically accessible.  This poses challenges to both theorists and experimenters, requiring that both communities stretch ingenuity to the limits in order to uncover as much as possible.  Accordingly, Professor Randall will continue to pursue research whose aim is to find the fullest potential of LHC experiments and to formulate consistent scenarios that will allow the most comprehensive tests of theoretical proposals.  The broader impact of this research is its strong interaction with the experimental community, as well as the training of junior scientists who will be involved in this project.  Professor Randall will also continue her involvement in the public communication of science.",
