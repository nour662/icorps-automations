Participants address opportunities and challenges for the mathematical sciences (including computational and statistical sciences) communities to engage in and to strengthen their participation in STEM educational reform efforts, in general, and modeling across the curriculum, in particular. Through the engagement of the various mathematical sciences components, the workshop contributes to the development of an effective model for engaging not only collaboration within NSF but also with SIAM and its community (including business and industry), allowing all to collaborate in the realm of education with those who have experience in teacher professional development.   This workshop clarifies the details for developing, advancing and implementing an agenda focused on mathematical modeling across the curriculum, contributes to the ongoing effort to promote broader participation of the mathematical sciences communities, and  facilitates the exchange of best practices and strategies between NSF program officers and workshop participants.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnder this grant, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics ( SIAM) convened the SIAM -NSF Workshop, Modeling across the Curriculum, on August 30-31, 2012. The goal of the project was to develop a set of recommendations for the STEM education community, broadly interpreted, on the design and incorporation of mathematical and computational modeling in STEM curricula.\n\nThe workshop participants developed three key recommendations\n\nExpand modeling in K-12,\n\nDevelop model-based undergraduate curricula\n\nDevelop a repository of materials for all aspects and levels of math modeling instruction, learning and understanding.\n\nThe report has implications for  several other activities. PIC Math (Preparation for Careers in Industry), a joint MAA/SIAM program, helps make faculty and their students more aware of non-academic careers in applied mathematics. TPSE Math (Transforming Post-Secondary Education in Mathematics), founded by some of the contributors to Math 2025,   emphasizes the importance of modeling and applications to a relevant undergraduate experience.\n\nThe final version of the report was published by SIAM both in print and as a downloadable PDF at www.siam.org/reports/modeling_12.pdf\n\nIn addition to the project report,  participants in the workshop developed a  handbook for mathematical modeling intended for  high school teachers and junior and senior students.\n\nMath Modeling:  Getting Started &amp; Getting Solutions\n\n  Bliss K M, Fowler K R, Galluzzo B J\n\n  Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia, PA\n\n  2014\n\nPDFs of the book are available for free download at http://m3challenge.siam.org/about/mm/.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/10/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James M Crowley"
