 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed work is to advance our understanding of the ways in which thinking in the mathematics domain is related to the emergence of other cognitive building blocks in the early years. The project will examine whether children are better at reasoning about fractions when questions are framed in the context of social, rather than physical relationships, thereby avoiding the whole number bias that hinders understanding. The work is a collaboration between a cognitive scientist and a mathematics educator at the University of Southern Mississippi and the work will largely take place in preschools and daycare center in the Southern Mississippi Gulf Coast. \r\n\r\nThe researchers will study about 180 preschoolers in a series of randomized, controlled experiments. They will present children with simple fraction and fair sharing problems in which they will be required to reason about how one should (a) share items among friends or (b) distribute items into containers. Each problem will also be presented to the children along with prompts that are either metacognitive or not metacognitive in order to determine whether prompting children to reflect on their own thoughts and feelings facilitates their ability to solve such tasks. By systematically manipulating these strategies and contexts, the researchers hope to determine whether social cognition facilitates problem solving outside of the social domain. By examining the relationships among children?s developing fundamental cognitive capacities and their rational number concepts, the researchers hope to determine whether they develop independently or scaffold up one another. The results could have significant implications for mathematics curriculum development.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLittle research has investigated the spontaneous strategies used by children under the age of five years to solve fraction or fair sharing problems.  We presented 180 children between the ages of three and five a series of cognitive tasks.  Each child participated in a total of five 30-60 minute sessions over two years of data collection, providing over 1,000 hours of video data.  Children's responses were analyzed to examine theory of mind, prosociality, and fraction task strategies.  The fraction tasks were presented and counter-balanced in a social or physical setting to understand the impact of the mathematical context.\n\nA repeated measures ANOVA comparing performance on socially and physically framed tasks as a function of age and sex revealed a significant effect of age.  Children performed progressively better on both types of tasks with age.  We examined the children's performance on the social and physical problems separately with regard to several predictor variables in a series of linear regressions.  When the total score for physically framed problems was regressed on age, verbal and performance IQ, prosocial behavior score and theory of mind total score, verbal IQ had a significant effect on socially framed problems but not on physically framed problems.  This finding corroborates a hypothesized relationship between language and social reasoning specifically, rather than fraction fair sharing problems generally.  Performance on the sequencing task, which includes a test of theory of mind, also predicted performance on the socially framed tasks, as well as the physically framed tasks.  Age also predicted better performance on both social and physical problems.\n\nIn addition to examining relationships between the predictor variables and fraction performance, we analyzed children's performance on the prosocial task independently.  Although Chris Moore (2009) conducted a similar study with young children's, the children in his study were slightly older (4.5 to 6 years of age) and he did not include a control condition in which there was no recipient.  We extended Moore's findings by showing intriguing age related differences and potential connections to prosocial behaviors as well.  In our coding of the types of mathematical strategies employed to solve fair sharing problems, we documented significant age related differences with children not able to partition accurately until the age of five.  Overall, we documented that prosocial behavior and theory of mind may not predict performance on fair sharing problems, regardless of context, whereas verbal reasoning may differentially impact performance on socially framed fair sharing problems.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/16/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lynne U Chronister"
