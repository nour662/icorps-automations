 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of US scientists in an international planning workshop devoted to discussions of how to best facilitate and coordinate international efforts for terrestrial system studies at the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. To date, various aspects of the different Dry Valley landscape features (lakes, soils, glaciers, streams) and their biota have been studied most intensively by US and New Zealand scientists, but these efforts could significantly improve their explanatory power if they were coordinated so as to reduce redundancy, decrease environmental degradation and, most importantly, produce comparable datasets. Additionally, many of the present environmental management programs are based on the past baseline composition and location of biotic communities. As these communities become rearranged across the valleys in the future there is interest in assessing whether today's management plans are adequate. To efficiently move these research programs forward for the McMurdo Dry Valleys requires a coordinated, interdisciplinary, long-term data monitoring and observation network. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate objectives of the workshop are to: i) identify the optimal, complementary suites of measurements required to assess and address key processes associated with environmental change in Dry Valley ecosystems; ii) develop standards and protocols for gathering the most critical biotic and abiotic measurements associated with the key processes driving environmental change; iii) generate a draft data coordination and development plan that will maximize the utility of these data; iv) assess the effectiveness of current McMurdo Dry Valley ASMA (Antarctic Special Management Area) environmental protection guidelines.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBackground &ndash; The McMurdo Dry Valleys\n\nThe McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, are a series of valleys bordering the Ross Sea that constitute the largest ice-free region of the continent.  Sheltered by the Transantarctic Mountains, the valleys receive very little annual precipitation, yet they contain several lakes and the longest river in Antarctica, all fed by melting glaciers in the mountains above.\n\n \n\nWhy are the McMurdo Dry Valley Ecosystems Important?\n\nThe McMurdo Dry Valleys provide one of the best places on Earth to figure out how ecosystems respond to climate change &ndash; now, and in the future.  Life here, in the form of bacteria, algae, lichens, and tiny invertebrates show amplified responses to even the smallest changes in sunlight or temperature. .  As a sentinel for regional change, the McMurdo Dry Valleys provide an outstanding terrestrial model for understanding ecosystem structure and functioning because they are relatively simple (in terms of biodiversity, community structure, and biotic interactions), they are geophysically well-defined (much is known about their geological and biological history).  But most importantly they are undergoing rapid and dramatic changes involving sunlight, water, and temperature, and these are having dramatic effects on the organisms and ecosystems that live here.\n\n \n\nWhat\u00c6s the problem?\n\nOver the last 20+ years the United States, New Zealand, Italy, Korea and Australia have sent scientists to the McMurdo Dry Valleys to study its lake, stream, soil and glacial ecosystems to try to figure out how these ecosystems are responding to in response to changes in their environment.  Although their research to date is widely regarded as some of the best in the world, on this topic, it has not been a coordinated international effort using standardized measures  It is thus difficult to answer both urgent as well as more fundamental questions because scientists are unable to compare their results across larger spatial or temporal scales.  Therefore, although the scientific measurements are extremely valuable, our interpretations of these data are often limited to the specific area and time period in which they were taken.\n\n \n\nHow we solved the problem:\n\n We gathered together a large group of McMurdo Dry Valley scientists, information managers and leaders of environmental management programs from the US, New Zealand, Korea, and Australia.  Through our workshop activities and much subsequent collaborative effort, we developed a framework for a multinational, coordinated, interdisciplinary, long-term data monitoring and observation network.  We are confident that if the network is put into place it will improve the explanatory power of existing data, improve cost efficiency, reduce redundancy, and decrease environmental degradation.  Most importantly, the observation network we designed provides for comparable datasets that are easy to access and use, and allow for more powerful and accurate inferences about how ecosystems respond to climate change.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nOur project benefited tremendously by our successful targeting of women, early career scientists, underrepresented groups, and members of the international community who have a stake in McMurdo Dry Valleys ecological research.  We feel strongly that these efforts will go a long way towards capacity building in environmental, geological and ecological sciences.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/08/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Byron J Adams"
