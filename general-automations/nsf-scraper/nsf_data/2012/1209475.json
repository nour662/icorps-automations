 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Colleen Carlston of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to conduct a research project, entitled \"Regulatory changes in flatworm gene expression during learning,\" during the summer of 2012 at Kyoto University.  The host scientist is Dr. Kiyokazu Agata.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is the study of habituation to light in the model organim, Planaria, a flat worm.  Using genetic tools, the pathway that leads to habituation to light is being investigated in both nervous and non-nervous tissues to determine how protein synthesis may play a role in this learning.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
