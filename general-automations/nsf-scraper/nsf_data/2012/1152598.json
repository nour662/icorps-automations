 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Research at Undergraduate Institutions project funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Geneive Henry, from Susquehanna University, will investigate the chemical diversity of Hypericum species growing in the state of Pennsylvania. The Hypericum genus (Clusiaceae plant family) consists of over 450 species distributed worldwide. The genus is known as a prolific source of structurally diverse natural products, possessing a wide range of biological properties including anti-HIV, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. The complex molecular frameworks and biological activities associated with some Hypericum natural products have made the genus an attractive source of scaffolds for the development of new synthetic methodologies, and lead structures for the development of combinatorial libraries. Approximately forty percent of the known Hypericum species have been investigated, leaving a rich source of chemical and biological diversity largely untapped. There are sixteen native and previously uninvestigated species of the Hypericum genus growing in the state of Pennsylvania. The objective of the research project will be two-fold: (1) to isolate and chemically characterize prenylated acylphloroglucinol derivatives, xanthones, benzophenone glucosides and flavonoids present in Pennsylvania Hypericum plants, and (2) to establish whether any chemotaxonomic relationships exist among these species. \r\n\r\nThe project will have fundamental impact on the chemical sciences, and could potentially impact the pharmaceutical sector, as it would provide complex bioactive natural products of interest to the synthetic chemistry community. The research activities will impact undergraduate student training and education in the following ways. Students will: (1) gain expertise in experimental design through hands-on research activities that will develop independence and confidence; (2) analyze data to determine the structures of complex organic molecules, thus developing problem-solving skills; (3) present data at scientific meetings and help with manuscript preparation, enhancing written and oral presentation skills. The acquisition of these skills will prepare students for careers in the chemical discipline. The research activities will also impact a wider audience through workshops designed to enrich the educational experience of high school students, and enhance the professional development of grades 6-12 teachers in the Central Susquehanna Valley.",

The students were able to learn the application of column chromatographic technique to the separation of components in an extract of Hypericum perforatum (St. John\u00c6s wort), obtained from a local pharmacy.\n\nOne important area of broader impact is the number of women who participated in the project. Nine of the fifteen students who participated in this project were females. This group of females included one African American and two Asian Americans.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/14/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Geneive E Henry"
