 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Winston Anderson is the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Professor at Howard University (HU).  He has devoted the last 44 years of his academic life to the intellectual enhancement and mentoring of African Americans and other underrepresented groups from K-12 to postdoctoral levels of education.  To that end, he has leveraged his HHMI Professor Award to provide research opportunities for HU students.  His 12-point mentoring program focuses on K-12 education, early identification of gifted students and their recruitment into the Howard Hughes Medical Research Scholars program at HU.  As the Principal Investigator of Rockefeller and PEW Foundation awards for ten years, he established Howard University-Rockefeller (HUROC) centers for the summer biomedical sciences training of high school students at 26 sites throughout the U.S.  More than 1,200 high school students participated in summer research, and more than 70% of the HUROC and PEW Pre-College Science and Mathematics trainees pursued university careers.  Approximately 200 undergraduate science and mathematics students received exposure to state-of-the-art research in the sciences under his Research Careers for Minority Scholars grant from the National Science Foundation and his Minority Biomedical Research Scholars grant from the National Institutes of Health.",
