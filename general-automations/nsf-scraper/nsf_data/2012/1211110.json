 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) is the main conduit for transporting surface and upper thermocline water from the western equatorial Pacific into the Indian Ocean. The volume and temperature of the ITF varies seasonally due to the seasonal influx of low salinity surface water from the South China and Java Seas into the Makassar Strait during the northern winter monsoon.  This low salinity \"plug\" generates a northward pressure gradient in the Makassar Strait that seasonally inhibits the flow of warm surface water in the far western Pacific Ocean from freely flowing southward into the Indian Ocean. The net result is a cooling and freshening of the Indian Ocean thermocline. Despite the oceanographic significance of this seasonal freshening of the Makassar Strait on the ITF, little is known about century to decadal-scale variability of salinity in the Makassar Strait. Previous low-resolution studies based on sediment cores in the Makassar Strait indicate that during the Little Ice Age (~1600-1850 AD), salinity and sea surface temperature in the strait were both reduced.  This research utilizes Porites sp. coral cores from Kapoposang in the southern Makassar Strait near S.W. Sulawesi and from Gili Meno in the Lombok Strait near Bali to develop partially replicated, near-monthly resolution, trace element (Sr/Ca) and stable isotope (d18Osw) records spanning the last 250 years. Results show that coral Sr/Ca variability accurately tracks the annual bi-modal sea surface temperature cycle. The research will enhance understanding of salinity and SST variability in this critical strait in order to constrain ITF variability over the last 250 years.  Changes in the freshwater budget of the southern Makassar Strait are expected to alter the intensity of the  \"freshwater plug\", with lower salinity in the Makassar Strait surface layer leading to a cooler ITF. Funding supports a postdoctoral associate and research experiences for undergraduates.",

The primary goal was to reconstruct surface salinity and temperature variability in the Makassar strait over the last ~170 years and to evaluate the effects on the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) which annually transports surface and thermocline depth water from the Pacific Ocean north of the equator to 12&deg;S in the Indian Ocean. Today, the net result of the ITF is a cooling and freshening of the Indian Ocean thermocline. One mechanism to explain this relatively cool ITF comes from limited instrumental data suggesting that the seasonal influx of low salinity surface water from the South China and Java Seas into the southern Makassar Strait lowers surface salinity by 2 to 3 SP (salinity units) and generates a northward pressure gradient during the winter monsoon (Dec-Mar). The low salinity \"plug\" seasonally inhibits the flow of warm surface water in the far western Pacific Ocean from freely flowing southward into the Indian Ocean. However, little is known about interannual and lower frequency salinity changes in the Makassar Strait due to a lack of instrumental and detailed paleoceanographic data.\n\nStudy Sites and Methods\n\nStudy Sites:  We analyzed previously collected corals that were loaned to us by Dr. Tim Rixen (University of Bremen, Germany) and Dr. Chris Charles (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, California).\n\n(1). At Kapoposong, in the central Makassar Strait, we analyzed Sr/Ca at 1mm intervals along a Porites coral core loaned to us by Dr. Tim Rixen (University of Bremen) back to 0.85m (~1938 AD) (n=871).  On the same core we also analyzed d18O and d13C back to the core bottom at a resolution of 1mm back to 400mm then at every-other 1mm resolution to the bottom of the core at 871mm (total isotope samples analyzed =644, back to 1938 AD). We used the presence of distinct fluorescent bands to verify and refine our chronology based on density banding and annual d18O cycles.  The final chronology extends from 2004 to 1938 AD.\n\n(2).

Annual &delta;18O variations of 1-1.5 &permil; and thin but distinct fluorescent banding coincident with &delta;18O minima were used to develop the chronology. Sub-seasonal &delta;18O is highly correlated to \"pseudocoral\" &delta;18O calculated from monthly salinity and water temperature data (r2 = 0.65, 1980-2004). The coral &delta;18O record demonstrates that the annual 2-3 SP salinity reduction during the winter monsoon (Dec- Mar) is a consistent pattern.  During El Ni&ntilde;o conditions the freshening in the strait is reduced by ~50% for moderate events, and by up to 90% for \"very strong\" El Ni&ntilde;o\u00c6s such as the 1982/83 and 1997/98 events. Interannual coral &delta;18O variability closely tracks the Ni&ntilde;o3.4 SST, the Southern Oscillation Index, and additional equatorial Pacific coral &delta;18O records. The fact that interannual Sr/Ca variability..."
