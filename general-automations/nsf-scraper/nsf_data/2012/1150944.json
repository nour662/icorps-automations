A multidisciplinary course on engineering and economics of electric energy systems will be offered to students at Texas A&M and Prairie View A&M. The PI will mentor undergraduate students, in particular under-represented groups, to develop a smart phone-based application to raise students? interest in electric energy. As the founding advisor, the PI will actively participate in community outreach activities organized by Texas A&M Energy Club.",
