 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project in the Department of Chemistry is developing a junior-level, studio-style laboratory to replace traditional labs associated with Physical Chemistry I and II, Instrumental Analysis, and Inorganic Chemistry.  The collaborative, in-depth experience being provided by this guided inquiry approach is bridging the gap, in a deliberate continuous chain-of-engagement method, for students as they transition from a multi-week synthesis project at the end of their sophomore year to the year-long original research project conducted in their fourth and final year of study.  \r\n\r\nThe project is increasing student learning opportunities by adding isothermal titration calorimetry and zeta-potential measurements to both the Chemistry and Biochemstry curricula.  The instruments being purchased through this grant and the experimental measurements they allow, are providing students with cutting edge experiences in nanotechnology and in biochemistry, and are equipping students with advanced technological understanding and enhanced scientific skills.  The project is a part of a deliberate and systematic plan that is preparing students to perform research independently.  The three semester long projects being added to the studio lab are:  (1) examining the formation reaction dynamics, stability and properties of colloidal zinc sulfide and suspended polypyrrole; (2) using vibrational spectroscopy, particularly Raman, to analyze the different parameters related to the synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles; and (3) an examination of the kinetics, thermodynamics, and non-covalent interactions for an enzyme-substrate pair.\r\n\r\nThe studio laboratory approach is addressing a need for enhanced mentor-mentee relationship and is bolstering team working skills by enabling peer interactions in a more-open lab environment.  The project is an intentional effort in sustaining and growing curricular choices that have proven effective in not only recruiting and retaining minority and/or women students, but also in encouraging students to consider further education and, ultimately, working in the STEM disciplines.  The project is providing valuable insight into the conversion of advanced labs into studio-labs that will aid those in the broader community as they seek to implement similar conversions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOVERVIEW:\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to increase student learning opportunities through the addition of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and zeta-potential measurements to the Chemistry and Biochemistry curricula.  The incorporation of these measurements will provide the capability to facilitate cutting edge inquiry in nanotechnology and biochemistry, equip students with needed technological understanding, and build critical scientific skills.  This proposal describes a collaborative in-depth exploratory junior level laboratory plan that will be run as guided inquiries that will further prepare students to perform research independently.  Students in this lab course will be given springboard research/lab ideas with some background information.  As the projects proceed, student groups will ask their own questions, and the mentor will facilitate the ways in which they might answer their questions.  We propose to take this exploratory laboratory course and incorporate one in-depth project per project mentor, allowing the students to go further in their exploration, cultivating a confident research-independent student at the end of the process.  Moving in this direction will facilitate the following goals:\n\nGoal 1:  Going further with new content&mdash;colloid/surface science, nanotechnology, and biochemistry.\n\nGoal 2: Going further with integrated (covering multiple chemistry sub-disciplines) labs&mdash;extended investigative experiences with selected chemical systems.\n\nGoal 3: Going further by increasing our students\u00c6 exposure to certain methods&mdash;multiple exposures through applications to organic, inorganic, and biochemical systems in several laboratory courses.\n\nGoal 4: Going further by incorporation of isothermal titration calorimetry and zeta potential measurement into the undergraduate teaching laboratories.\n\nTherefore, the emphasis of the proposed collaborative in-depth exploratory junior level laboratory acts as our junior-level link in our chain of engagement for recruitment and retention of students.  The project's secondary emphasis is the opportunity to facilitate mentor-mentee interactions at other primarily undergraduate institutions through the use of studio-style laboratories.  \n\nPROBLEMS IN CHEMISTRY SEQUENCE (CHM 371-372): REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nGAINS\n\nA. Writing skill\n\nThe Problems in Chemistry team has been using a five-week writing intensive kick-off connected to a mini-project.

CHM 371: (1) Writing intensive kick off; (2) Extended research-related project 1. CHM 372: (1) Extended research-related project 2; (2) Extended research-related project 3. Recommendation: The team recommends continuing this model for CHM 371-372, including a curricular change proposal to include this model in the course descriptions in the Catalog. We also recommend that all faculty members assigned to CHM 371-372 meet at the end of the previous academic year to make decisions about the writing requirements for the Problems students and ..."
