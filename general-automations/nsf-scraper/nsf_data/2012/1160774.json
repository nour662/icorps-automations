 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this proposal we respectfully request NSF funding to support the organization of a workshop entitled ?Collaborative Research Opportunities in Telecommunications Technologies,? to be held Nv.1-2, 2011, in Dublin, Ireland. The objective of the workshop is to stimulate discussion, encourage interactions, and help establish research ties between leading researchers in the US and Ireland. Research focus will be on various areas of telecommunications in both the optical fibers and the wireless technologies. It is expected that through detailed presentations by researchers from both countries that the group will be able to share knowledge on emerging technologies, identify bottlenecks, and discuss collaborative avenues for collaborations. It is hoped that as a result of the workshop several joint proposals will be submitted by not only the participating group but also by their colleagues at their institutions.\r\nThe workshop will be for two days, with the first day focused on presentations by researchers from both side, while the second day will focus on interactive sessions and panel discussions to help enhance the cooperation and initiate more activities to capitalize on the presence of US scientists in Dublin.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nBased on the proposed workshop presentations that will be made by leading researchers from both countries, and through discussions on potential future research opportunities during panel sessions, significant progress will be made towards identifying innovative research ideas in the telecommunications area and hopefully avenues for enabling next generation of this technology will be jointly pursued by the participating groups and their institutions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nThe workshop will lead to establishing ties between researchers in both countries. It is hoped that this will lead to joint proposals and collaborative interactions between telecommunication researchers both in Ireland and the US.",
