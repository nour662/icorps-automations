 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development of numerical tools and nanomanufacturing processes for characterizing the structure-process-performance relationships of nanosphere coatings on silicon thin films. These coatings have the potential to not only enhance solar efficiencies without introducing additional surface recombination, but also reduce manufacturing processes and costs. The developed numerical tools will determine optimal structures for enhanced efficiencies while considering both ordered and disordered structures. Detailed simulations will be performed on optimal structures to determine the role of scattering and whispering gallery modes as well as to determine the angular performance of coated solar cells and evaluate transport characteristics. Scalable, inexpensive spin coating methods will be used to understand how nanosphere coatings may be assembled onto silicon thin film photovoltaics.  Manufactured samples will be characterized structurally, optically, and electronically to validate simulations.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will lead to improvements in the design of next-generation solar cells. This could also have a profound impact on other nanophotonic applications that make use of whispering gallery modes such as optical filters and biosensors. A broad impact is envisioned in the areas of solar cells, topology optimization, and nanomanufacturing.  This project will also educate and outreach to next-generation engineers through open source software development, the introduction of various education modules, and involvement with the Pitt Office of Diversity's INVESTING NOW summer program.",

The LiBH<sub>4 </sub>+ MgH<sub>2</sub> system has attracted worldwide attention in the last several years because of its potential to store and release hydrogen at relatively low temperatures with a theoretical capacity of 11.6 wt.% H<sub>2. </sub>Thermodynamically, hydrogen release of the 2LiBH<sub>4 </sub>+ MgH<sub>2</sub> mixture at temperature below 200 <sup>o</sup>C would be possible.

In this process, aerosol droplets of LiBH<sub>4</sub> solution are sprayed into the air-tight canister of an attritor, while ball milling of MgH<sub>2</sub> powder is taking place. Aerosol liquid droplets will become solid nanoparticles when the droplets impinge on the surface of MgH<sub>2</sub> particles and balls where the local temperature can be high (~200 <sup>o</sup>C) due to the high speed collision of balls. As a result, LiBH<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles will coat on the surface of MgH<sub>2</sub> particles and be occluded into MgH<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles later as ball milling continues because of repeated fracture and cold-welding of MgH<sub>2</sub> particles during ball milling. We have shown that nanoscale LiBH<sub>4</sub> and MgH<sub>2</sub> can react to form MgB<sub>2</sub> and LiH with release of H<sub>2</sub> if ball milling is performed without water cooling. This is the first time that nanoscale LiBH<sub>4</sub> and MgH<sub>2 </sub>are proven to react near room temperature to release hydrogen gas &ndash; a goal long pursued by many investigators but not able to accomplish it. The hydrogen release from the LiBH<sub>4</sub>+MgH<sub>2</sub> mixture near the ambient temperature becomes possible because nanoparticles have low kinetic barriers. In fact, a new reaction pathway, as predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, has been taken by the BMAS-processed nanoscale LiBH<sub>4</sub>+MgH<sub>2</sub> mixture. In contrast, micrometer-sized LiBH<sub>4</sub>+MgH<sub>2</sub> mixtures cannot take this reaction pathway because of their significant kinetic barriers.

Such an important result has never been achieved before by any other means unless the tactics leading to irreversible reactions is used.
