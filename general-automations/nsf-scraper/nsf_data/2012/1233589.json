 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although proteins represent the primary source of new organic nitrogen in the ocean, the identification of individual proteins and mechanisms modulating their preservation has faced analytical and computational challenges in deciphering the vast suite of possible sequences and degradation by-products.  Recent efforts to link geochemical cycling, biomedical proteomics and bioinformatics has demonstrated that only a small subset of the suite of proteins produced by marine diatoms appear to survive the degradation process, and those that do are largely protected by physical and enthalpic barriers to microbial attack. Although these discoveries help to explain the survival of individual proteins, they also generate multiple questions regarding bacteria as the dominant recyclers of organic nitrogen and carbon and needs for specific approaches to characterize modified protein products. Bacteria dominate the water column and sedimentary systems in both numbers and diversity, yet their relative contribution to the preserved proteomic pool appears low. \r\n\r\nIn this project, researchers at Old Dominion Universityand the University of Washington will join forces to decipher the bacterial role in protein recycling and their potential contribution. By integrating high mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics with stable isotope-based geochemical analysis, they hope to identify those bacterial proteins initially synthesized during organic matter recycling. Three research objectives drive this investigation:  (1) to determine the potential contribution of bacteria proteins to marine organic matter; (2) to identify those protein(s) synthesized by heterotrophic marine bacteria during initial stages of organic matter degradation; (3) to determine if glycan (carbohydrate) modifications represent an important component of preserved, yet unidentified, peptides seen in our analysis of oceanic particles and sediments.\r\n\r\n Broader Impacts:  This project will provide multiple opportunities for interdisciplinary student training in marine chemistry and proteomics as well as address the goal of disseminating results and tools to a broad audience. In the more traditional role, this project will expand the career for a female principal investigator in marine proteomics, support both graduate and undergraduate students at ODU which include opportunities for minority enrichment and provide training for a postdoctoral fellow at UW. On the broader level, the ODU PI participates in high school outreach programs for high achieving students in the local school which provides for summer internships and enrichment programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProteins accounts for a major portion of the material in most living cells and its synthesis and expression is a fundamental property of all living things.  As such its response during growth and to the environment has many implications for multiple fields of science especially the cycling of proteins in the ocean.   A full understanding of the actual extent of protein  cycling in marine systems faces at least three major impediments: 1) the potential number of proteins is vast, yet often unknown, 2) exposure to biological and chemical catalysts during organic recycling reactions can alter or modify the original protein structure, obscuring its identification and 3)  bacteria are the major agents  for changes in proteins but are very dynamic in their work on protein hydrolysis, resynthesize, and modification.  In order to quantitatively or (even) qualitatively follow proteins and their potential for preservation under environmentally realistic conditions, we must be able to determine protein or peptide sequences over a broad continuum of complex structures and conditions in the environment.   This study linked two fields which do not often overlap to better understanding of the cycling of proteins in the ocean.  The first was marine organic geochemistry which seeks to understand the chemistry of organic materials produced and recycled the ocean.   The focus is often on individual molecules and what insight they can provide into the cycling of elements.  The second field is proteomics, the study of proteins which is based on biomedical analysis of thousands of proteins in a single sample.  By linking marine organic geochemistry and environmental proteomics, this project provided a case study of an approach which combines two diverse fields to address essential questions for the cycling of a major component of the living ocean that needed intense analytical work and statistical analysis.  By better defining the proteins in ocean systems,  we can asked questions about major element cycling and the response of specific groups of organisms to their environment.\n\nThe findings for this work showed that among the thousands of possible proteins, a select few are not rapidly recycled in the surface ocean waters, but eventually are preserved in the surface sediments.  These protein are protected from recycling by both physical measures as well as chemical cross links which slow their losses.  Bacterial are very active in the process and contribute their own distinctive distribution proteins which appear over time.  A major part of this work was to develop analytical tools for analysis and the statistical interpretation of the thousands of proteins identified in marine systems and laboratory experiments using marine bacteria, training both graduate students and undergradutes along the way. These results made important progress in our ability to identify the proteins in the environment and trace their origins with confidence.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/09/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: H.
