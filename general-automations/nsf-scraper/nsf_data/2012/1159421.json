 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamics Days is an annual interdisciplinary conference designed to stimulate interactions among researchers in nonlinear science.  Dynamics Days 2012 will cover a broad range of topics, including pattern forming systems, characterization and control of nonlinear systems, synchronization of nonlinear systems, and complex biological systems. The meeting will be hosted by the Department of Physics, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Institute for Physical Science and Technology and the Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied Physics of the University of Maryland, College Park. This year's schedule is designed to provide a broad overview of nonlinear dynamics and will include tutorial talks which will be geared toward introducing opportunities in nonlinear dynamics.\r\n\r\nDynamics Days has been very successful at providing a forum for bringing young scientists, especially graduate students and postdoctoral students, together with experts from a variety of fields.   Although the regular attendees are primarily in the fields of mathematics and physics, the interdisciplinary field of nonlinear dynamics has continued to grow rapidly in recent years, expanding to other disciplines.    Researchers from physics, mathematics, chemistry, engineering, biology, and the social sciences are expected to attend Dynamics Days 2012.",
