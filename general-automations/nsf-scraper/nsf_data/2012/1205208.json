The goals of the project are to educate technicians to work in the advanced biofuels production industry and agriculture biomass production; develop instructional materials about advanced biofuels production; and establish a biofuels education pathway from area high schools to South Florida Community College to Florida universities.\r\n\r\nTo achieve its goals, the Bioenergy Education project is creating (1) Associate of Science degree programs in Biofuels Technology and in Biomass Cultivation, (2) industry-recognized certificate education programs in biofuels technology and biomass production, (3) transfer agreements with Florida universities, (4) continuing education workshops and seminars for biofuel industry professionals, and (5) dual-enrollment biofuels education courses for area high school students interested in biofuels. The evaluation plan is collecting quantitative data on participant enrollment, retention, graduation, transfer, and employment, and qualitative data on participant and employer satisfaction.",

In addition, SFSC delivered bioenergy-related education materials to aspiring high schools through a week long summer STEM program called AgDiscovery in June 2016. The AgDiscovery program focused on exploring educational and career opportunities in the bioenergy and agriculture industries and provided students with hands-on laboratory experiments related to bioprocessing, biofuel production, pollution control, wastewater and solid waste management, and environmental biotechnology, Non-credit seeking individuals also benefited from SFSC's Bioenergy Education Program through participation at the Biomass Feedstock Production in Florida's Heartland Conference in April 2016. The conference included presentations from academic researchers and industry professionals on how to cultivate a wide range of feedstocks (e.g., industrial sugar crops, oilseeds, algae, and woody biomass) and how to produce a wide range of biogas and liquid biofuels. At the completion of the grant, a total of 81 individuals received training through the A.S. and C.C.C. degree programs, summer STEM AgDiscovery program, and Biomass Feedstock Production in Florida's Heartland Conference of SFSC's Bioenergy Education Program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/21/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Erik&nbsp;Christensen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1205208/1205208_10215026_1479754203271_SFSCBiofuels-scope--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1205208/1205208_10215026_1479754203271_SFSCBiofuels-scope--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Biofuels Program microscope\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1205208/1205208_10215026_1479754203271_SFSCBiofuels-scope--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Biofuels Program microscope\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SFSC Biofuels Program student using microscope in the lab</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">n/a</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erik&nbsp;Christensen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Biofuels Program microscope</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
