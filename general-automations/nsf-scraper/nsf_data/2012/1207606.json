 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Colorado at Boulder is cofunded by the Networks and Regulations Cluster (BIO/MCB). This research is motivated by our recent discovery of a variety of liquid crystal phases of nanoscale nucleic acids (nDNA and nRNA), i.e. of liquid crystals of duplex nucleic acids as short as 6 base pairs, an exciting, unexplored class of liquid crystal forming molecules. Key to this project is the finding that in a mixture of complementary and noncomplementary nDNA, the complementary DNA is found only in the LC domains. Thus in the nDNA liquid crystal phases, the coupled steps of duplexing, end-to-end stacking of duplexes, and liquid crystal phase ordering and separation create a structural gatekeeper that enables only duplexable DNA to enter. Molecules that do enter are then organized into a structure that if stabilized by covalent links should enhance their complementarity and the liquid crystal phase stability. Thus, whether is it possible for a liquid crystal phase to autocatalytically select, template, and replicate its constituent molecules, will be a principal topic of the proposed research, with the long-term goal of starting with multicomponent mixtures of polycyclic aromatics and developing processes that lead to LC formation by a self-selected subset of molecules. If this can be shown then it is a strong argument that the linear structure of DNA is itself a result of liquid crystal templating in early life. This project will enable the training of a group of graduate and undergraduate students in an exciting new area of nucleic acid biophysics. As part of the outreach activities, the researcher will collaborate with industry in the area of liquid crystal science applications in bioscience, renewable energy and related areas.\r\n\r\nIt is widely believed by researchers studying the origin of life on Earth that life's first vestiges were systems of short self-replicating DNA-like molecules, that got up to about 30 bases long, emerging out of the so-called \"primordial soup\" of small prebiotic organic molecules in solution. Such an emergence is an \"explosion\" of complementarity, in which small molecules that are complementary, i.e., that can selectively stick together in pairs, seek each other out, collect together, and then react chemically into larger complementary units. In this project, the researcher has proposed the idea that condensation into liquid crystal droplets is a basic mechanism for selecting complementary molecules in such a process. With the addition of chemistry that couples up the short DNA into longer chains, condensation would strongly favor the lengthening of the already complementary DNA in the liquid crystal droplets. That is, complementarity would breed complementarity, in a process that selects for rod-shaped molecular assemblies, in order to promote liquid crystal order and phase separation. If this conjecture is correct, then we will have shown that the very linear polymer shape of DNA would have been templated by liquid crystal ordering in early life. The selection and reaction mechanisms explored are expected to open avenues to new kinds of hierarchically organized self assembled materials. The proposed educational activities included graduate curriculum development in soft condensed matter physics, and summer research activities such as Research Experience for Teachers, and Research Experience for Undergraduate students. Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities, Science Mathematics And Research for Transformation, and McNair programs providing undergraduate research opportunities for minorities and underrepresented groups are planned activities with this award.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe scientific knowledge of evolution is extensive, but limited by some notable, even embarrassing, gaps.  Among the most prominent of these is the lack of a coherent picture of the molecular participants and organizational themes that produced the earliest stages of life.  Currently envisioned scenarios have early life passing through the era of an \"RNA World\", in which simultaneously catalytic and information-carrying polymers formed chemically-active prebiotic systems.  However the availability of RNA and the origin of its design (a linear homopolymer having a small set of weakly polymorphic side groups capable of pairing) are yet to be understood. \n\nBased on the results of the research supported by this project on the collective behavior of nanometer length nucleic acid oligomers, we have been led to propose that a \"Liquid Crystal World\" preceded and gave rise to the RNA World, providing its basic molecular design and feedstock.  This proposal is completely unique because it views early life as a problem in materials research, introducing the life-essential themes of molecular selection, chemical templating, and catalysis at the earliest possible  stage, establishing autocatalytic molecular assembly based on the materials concept of liquid crystal (LC) soft-matter ordering rather than typical chemical catalysis.\n\nWe found that nucleic acid (NA) oligomers as short as 4 base pairs can carry out the self-assembly steps of duplexing, end-to-end aggregation of duplexes, and condensation of aggregates to form columnar liquid crystal phases.  We also found that in such phases the molecules, self-selected because of their complementarity, create a fluid structural and chemical environment in which oligomer ligation into longer polymers is strongly promoted.  This ligation represents an autocatalytic step in a positive feedback loop in which the liquid crystal structure selects, organizes and polymerizes molecules, thereby enhancing its own stability.  We proposed such a scenario as a mechanism for the appearance of sequence-directed assembly in early life, and for providing polymer feedstock to the RNA world.   \n\nThe Liquid Crystal World concept - We proposed that the combination of selection, catalysis, and physical organization is a feature of the Liquid Crystal World, a more primitive stage of life that preceded the RNA World, as sketched in the Figure.  The origin of LC phases of nano-length nucleic acids (nNAs) is molecular structure that puts them at the boundary of marginal solubility, where they must form collective mesoscale self-assemblies in order to stay in solution.  The project team discovered the resulting remarkable staged self-assembly of nNAs, wherein a hierarchy of base pairing, linear aggregation of nNA duplexes into stacks, LC ordering of the stacks, and phase separation of LC domains incorporates nNAs into a soft, yet highly structured, low entropy environment.  This process separates duplexing from non-duplexing nNAs even for random sequences,  holding duplex-forming oligomers in end-to-end contact to form chemically discontinuous but physically continuous double strands in the LC phase, columnar stacks very similar in structure to those in covalently linked (long) complementary NAs.\n\nThe core concept of the LC World is that this hierarchical self-assembly leading to LC ordering was instrumental in selecting pools of like molecular species and providing a structural template to guide their polymerization. According to this notion, nucleic acids emerged as the molecules most suited to the formation of linear polymers thanks to their propensity for LC ordering. Indeed, a number of features makes this phenomenon appealing:  &bull;hierarchical self-assembly provides an intrinsic molecular selection, concentrating duplexable molecules and segregating out others;  &bull;LC ordering provides a fluid, permeable and reversible matrix that holds the chain terminals in continuous close contact, enormously enhancing their chance for chemically ligating into chains and catalytically promotes their chemical ligation, wherein longer chains stabilize the LC phase and vice-versa;  &bull;as ligation and chain lengthening occurs, an autocatalytic feedback loop is generated in which longer complementary sequences stabilize the LC ordering, favoring their further elongation.  In a critical test of these notions, we measured the efficiency of an abiotic ligation agent in polymerizing DNA dodecamers: the LC ordering was found to dramatically increase nNA ligation yield, generating polymerized nNAs with lengths up to one hundred times those present at the start.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/09/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Noel A Clark"
