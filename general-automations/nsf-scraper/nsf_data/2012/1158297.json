 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nFlowering plants contain clusters of repeated genes, many of which are involved in recognition of pathogens.  The structures of these genes are often highly variable and a combination of forces drives the diversification among repeated pathogen recognition genes.  This project investigates a unique situation in the model flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress), where the divergence between duplicated copies of a pathogen recognition gene called SNC1 is extremely rapid.   The project focuses on this particular model to define the molecular mechanisms responsible for the frequent birth-and-death of pathogen resistance genes in plants.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe project contains three different elements that broaden its impact.  First, the research addresses fundamental questions regarding the ways that genetic change and rapid evolutionary processes occur.  The results of the research will also provide insight into the forces that diversify a plant's arsenal of genes devoted to protection against agricultural pests.  The second broader impact of the project will be the training and mentoring of scientists at the postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate levels.  Finally, the project directly engages high school students in the central New York region in an authentic collaborative research project, connecting these students, as well as their teachers, with scientists at the Boyce Thompson Institute.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLarge and complex genomes from plants and animals contain large numbers of duplicated genes.  Why multiple copies of similar genes exist in a single genome is not fully understood.  One explanation is that multiple genes might be needed to produce a high enough level of the ultimate gene products, typically proteins, to carry out their necessary cellular functions.  Alternatively, gene duplications are thought to be the initial step on an evolutionary path to generate new gene functions.  In most cases, gene duplications do not have a negative effect on the organism.  We are studying an exceptional case in the flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, where an excess copy of a gene leads to defects - in this case, small plant size and reduced fertility due to duplication of a disease resistance gene called SNC1.\n\nOur previous findings indicated that duplication of SNC1, in a mutant we call bal, leads to genetic instability and a high rate of recovery of normal looking plants in the progeny after treatment with a mutagen.  The overarching objective of the project was to understand the cause of this genetic instability.  The more specific objective of this project was to distinguish between two working models explaining the high rate of mutation of the SNC1 disease resistance gene in  bal variant.  The first model explains SNC1 genetic variation as a consequence of locus-specific mutagenesis induced by DNA damage.  The alternative model holds that the high-frequency recovery of SNC1 mutations is due to the selection of snc1 inactivating mutations in during vegetative growth.  Our results support the latter model and demonstrate a mechanism that can cause the rapid diversification of genes in flowering plants.  More broadly, our findings underscore the evolutionary importance of a unique feature of plant development: a delay in the separation of reproductive and somatic cell lineages.  In plants, reproductive tissues that give rise to flowers are derived directly from vegetative tissues.  In contrast, in many animals, the so-called 'germ line,' which will eventually produce sperm or egg cells, is set aside early in development from somatic cells.  The delay in this separation in plants allows new mutations that benefit cell survival to be enriched in vegetative tissues and, therefore, become preferentially incorporated into flowers to be passed along to the next generation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/23/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Richards"
