The participants will learn the current techniques in the most significant areas of probability theory, including growth models and exclusion process, last passage percolation, random maps and their scaling limits. It is expected that the participants will engage in active research on some topics covered by the main courses and related areas. PIMS Summer School 2012 will be a great opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers to learn some of the most significant modern probability theory from the top experts in the field. The junior participants are often current and future academic faculty, able to spread the knowledge of the modern techniques further in the research community.",
