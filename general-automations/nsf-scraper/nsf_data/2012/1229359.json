It is necessary to separate proteins from the E.coli expression system that are used for bioengineering proteins. The focus of The Spiller Lab is to engineer a small, bright red fluorescent protein tag for in vivo microscopy. Undergraduate, post baccalaureate and glide-year students at Mills College are engaged in the laboratory work.",
