SECON is a premier conference in the areas of sensor, ad\r\nhoc, and mesh networking, serving as a meeting point of researchers from academia and industry,\r\nas well as practitioners in diverse fields of wireless communications and networking. This project\r\nsupports travel to the conference for US based graduate students who might not otherwise be able\r\nto attend for financial reasons. Students will be exposed to the conference, a technical forum that\r\nis critical for their professional maturity and development. Students will also be involved in various\r\nactivities and work as volunteers to support these activities, increasing their level of involvement\r\nand connection to the conference and the research community.",
