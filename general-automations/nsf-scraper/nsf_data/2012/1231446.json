It will consist of one day of invited lectures. The talks will cover a variety of connections between computer science and biology, with emphasis on the uses of formal logic in modeling biomolecular interaction systems.\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\r\nThe LICS organizing committee believes that logic will have an important role in systems biology, and invited a proposal for a workshop to explore current and future applications of logic to system biology. Since systems biology is a new field of study which is still unfamiliar to most LICS attendees, the organizers decided to restrict the lectures to invitation only, with an open session for discussion of future research. The lectures are intended to be accessible to computer scientists who have some knowledge about the use of formal methods for analyzing software and hardware, but who may not have much experience with biology. The speakers will also be invited to submit more technical versions of their talks to a refereed proceedings.\r\nBROADER IMPACT\r\nThe lectures will explore connections between biology, computer science, and mathematics, with the goal of encouraging collaborations between researchers in the different groups, leading to new applications of logic and raising interesting theoretical questions. It is also expected that graduate students and recent Ph. D.s in computer science will attend the workshop. Since the talks will be partly expository, this will be an opportunity for them to broaden their perspective, with future benefits to their research and teaching.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Workshop on Logic and Systems Biology was affiliated with the Logic in Computer Science Conference (LICS) and took place in Dubrovnik, Croatia on June 29, 2012.  The conference organizers were aware that attendees of previous LICS Conferences were interested in learning more about systems biology and its connections with logic, in particular computer-aided verification and formal methods.  An outstanding group of speakers presented talks covering many aspects of systems biology and its relations to computer science and logic.  Audience interest was very high, as shown by the questions and discussions between talks and during the breaks.\n\nIn summary, it was a meeting of similar, but still a bit different, perspectives and there was genuine and interesting discussion -- which went on into the evening over dinner.  One suggestion was the possibility of organizing a new instance of Logic and Systems Biology at the Federated Logic Conference 2014 in Vienna.  This will be a much larger meeting which will include LICS and other major computer science conferences.  Vienna is also developing into an international center of research in the field, with several new academic departments and research institutes of systems biology.  It would be an opportunity to encourage futher collaborations between computer scientists and systems biologists.\n\nProgram\n 9:00 -- 9:45         Paul Ruet                                Dynamics and structure of Boolean asynchronous networks\n\n\n 9:45 -- 10:30        Maria Luisa Guerriero        Modelling prolactin signalling and its interactions with other cancer-related signalling pathways\n\n10:30 -- 11:00        Coffee break\n\n11:00 -- 11:45        Heinz Koeppl            Inference of stochastic kinetics in the presence of cell-to-cell variability\n\n11:45 -- 12:30        Glynn Winskel            Graph rewriting and causality - the semantics of Kappa\n\n12:30 -- 14:00        Lunch break\n\n14:00 -- 14:45        Jim Faeder            An exact hybrid particle/population approach for modeling biochemical systems\n\n14:45 -- 15:30        Vincent Danos            Equilibrium and Termination\n\n15:30 -- 16:00        Tea break\n\n16:00 -- 17:00        Group discussion \n\nFurther information about the workshop is available at its website:\nhttp://http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~russ/lsb4.html\nwhich has links to the abstracts of the lectures.
