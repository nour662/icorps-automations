The conference will be held January 18-20, 2012 at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, DC. Over 1,100 participants from higher education institutions, government, civil society organizations, research and policy organizations, business, international organizations and governments are expected to attend.\r\nHow we address national security in the 21st Century is expanding, reflecting global environment pressures that pose challenges to the well-being and resilience of both human society and the natural environment. The Environment and Security Conference will address how environmental factors impact both national and personal security with a focus on five interconnected themes: climate disruption and security, energy security, water security, environment and public health security and food security.\r\nThe conference program will feature six keynote presentations, six plenary roundtables, 23 symposia and 25 interactive breakout workshops. Over 200 distinguished thought leaders, scientists, federal agency officials, policy experts and international authorities will speak at the workshops.",
