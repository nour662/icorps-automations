 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development in humans and other higher organisms creates complex,\r\nprecisely defined multicellular structures and patterns. These\r\nstructures are the result of molecular programs that are stored in the\r\nsequences and concentrations of biomolecules and are executed when\r\nmolecules interact and change state through chemical reactions. The\r\ngoal of this proposal is to understand how biochemical systems can be\r\nreliably programmed to form asymmetric patterns with multiple layers\r\nof organization. This proposal is part of a general goal to understand\r\nhow to program global behavior and structure based on local rules,\r\nwhich a key intellectual challenge in many areas of computer science.\r\n  \r\nThe PIs propose that complex, hierarchical chemical patterns can be formed\r\nby systems in which the molecules collectively execute a molecular\r\nprogram for pattern formation.  The PIs will develop a\r\nchemical programming language in which information from simple input\r\npatterns is integrated by logical operations to form new pattern\r\nregions.  These logical operations are then systematically integrated\r\ninto larger programs, allowing the generation of patterns with\r\ncomplex, multiscale structure similar to that seen in\r\nbiology. Designed synthetic DNA molecules that together act as circuit\r\nelements will be used to implement this language. DNA molecules are\r\nideal substrates for a molecular programming approach because they\r\nhave complex sequences with predictable behaviors and interactions.\r\nThis research is tightly integrated with an outreach program that will \r\ndevelop an educational program dedicated to teaching the\r\ninterdisciplinary skills that are necessary to be successful in\r\nmolecular programming.\r\n",

Afundamental challenge in science and engineering is to understand howsuch structures can emerge and to create design principles forbuilding these structures.  One important question here is how basicorganizational principles can be scaled to produce structures ofincreasing complexity.  Computer science has developed many tools toask how to understand scaling and in this award we used thesetechniques, in combination with new ideas from molecular engineering,to understand how to build chemical \"programs\" for creating structurethat can scale.\nOur specific focus was on reaction-diffusion processes.  Within such aprocess, molecules may react with one another, changing their state oreliminating or creating species, and molecules may move according tothe laws of diffusion.  It is understood that these two processestogether could enable molecules which initially appeared well mix toeffectively differentiate into patterns such as stripes or spots,where stripes or spots had high concentrations of one type of moleculeand and other areas had relatively low concentrations.  But couldthese processes create patterns more complex than stripes or spots?\nDuring this award, we developed a theory to show that in principle,the answer is yes: *any* spatial pattern may be constructed give asingle, simple input pattern and the ability to design the reactionsbetween many molecules, the rates of these reactions and theirdiffusion rates. We also showed using the same model that suchpatterns could also change over time, much as the body plan of ananimal grows and changes.  These results suggest thatreaction-diffusion processes could be powerful agents of patterngeneration for structures and shapes of tissues or organs, not justsimple patterns like spots or stripes.  Further, our methods alsoshowed how we could build such patterns using a simple \"patternprogramming language\" and the ability to design molecules, reactionsand their diffusion rates.\nWe felt that this development was of new interest at the time of theproposal's award because recent developments showed how a greatvariety of reactions could be engineered using syntheticoligonucleotides, or short DNA molecules.
