 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Description\r\nThis project is researching the hypothesis that motivation and learning in an introductory continuous time signals and systems (CTSS) course will improve if the theoretical presentation of material is augmented with weekly, sensory-based, application-oriented experiences. Laboratory exercises are being developed that are based on a hardware platform designed for measuring and processing realistic continuous-time signals. Summative assessments including surveys, focus groups, and specific rubrics applied to final exams are being used to measure changes in motivation and learning, in conjunction with baseline data that has been collected over a three-year period. The project incorporates learning theory in the development of materials to support student learning of the difficult engineering content that is associated with signals and systems related courses. Open-source modules are being produced that have a high potential for broad adoption. The effort also involves a comprehensive evaluation plan that is producing the data needed to convince others that they should consider adopting the platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Significance\r\nThe process that is being utilized in creating signals and systems content is informing the development of other introductory engineering course modules. A workshop is being developed and will be held at national conferences in which the participants will get to perform some of the laboratory exercises and keep the platform that they use. Furthermore, dissemination of the assessment results and materials is also being distributed through national conferences and journal publications. The outreach activities of the project have further potential to positively impact K-12 students and interest them in pursuing careers in engineering. In addition to the focus on CTSS courses, the platform is being utilized in a K-12 outreach program called Explore Engineering (at Rose-Hulman). The materials developed for the program introduce middle/high-school students to the concept of frequencies in relation to music, sounds, and electrocardiograph (ECG) signals. These materials are available to the public and the experiences are informing the development of further outreach activities and collaborations.",
