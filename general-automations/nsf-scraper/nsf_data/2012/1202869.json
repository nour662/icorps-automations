 "awd_abstract_narration": "How can spatial heterogeneity buffer plant communities against climate change?\r\n\r\nSpatial heterogeneity in the physical environment plays a critical role in driving many ecological patterns and processes and has recently been implicated as an important factor responsible for buffering some communities against climate change.  However, the specific mechanism by which spatial heterogeneity confers temporal stability remains unclear.  Here, field experiments and empirical models will be used to test two classes of mechanisms for how spatial heterogeneity might buffer communities against climate change.  Some buffering mechanisms may operate independently of species interactions, such as when heterogeneity provides physical refugia for species.  Alternatively, in communities structured by competitive interactions, spatial heterogeneity might buffer communities via a class of mechanism involving species coexistence mechanisms.  This project will test the relative importance of these mechanisms using field experiments in annual serpentine grasslands and simulation models parameterized with data collected from the experiments.  \r\n\r\nThis NSF fellowship will support postdoctoral training in research and teaching.  Professional training will include extensive analyses using modern statistical programs, such as R, and current modeling approaches.  In addition to participating in teaching seminars and course to improve pedagogical skills, the Fellow will teach core courses and serve as a mentor to undergraduate and graduate students at the host institution, Utah State University.  Another promising avenue for community outreach is through participation in Distributed Graduate Seminars on climate change in the sagebrush steppe plant community.  Finally, the Fellow will continue to provide logistical and long-term planning support to the K-12 science education program, Kids into Discovering Science (KiDS).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n The impacts of climate change continue to mount and it has become imperative that ecologists generate accurate predictions of which species and communities are most vulnerable.  While some plant communities seem to respond dramatically to natural or experimentally imposed climate change, others seem to be relatively resistant.  My research focuses on identifying the mechanisms that promote resistance to climate change within these communities.  Specifically, I am using experimental and modeling approaches to understanding how variation in soil may reduce the effects of competition among species and lessen the impact of drought.  I have found that spatial variation in soil texture may alter soil moisture such that species have smaller differences in reproductive success than when there is no variation in soil texture.  While this is not evidence for a reduction in competition, a reduction in reproductive differences can allow species to co-exist over many generations.  Thus, this supports the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity as a buffer against climate change.  Modeling efforts also suggest this buffering effect may be enhanced through competitive mechanisms if species demonstrated soil specific germination patterns (i.e. species preferentially germinated on different soils).  Thus, while species may dominate patches of their preferred soil, coexistence is possible across patches of different soils.  These results provide important insights into which communities may be relatively resistant to changes in climate over many generations. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barbara M Going"
