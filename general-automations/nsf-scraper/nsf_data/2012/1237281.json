The workshop seeks to share the state-of-the-art in this area as well as identify opportunities for research advancement.  It will bring together leaders from academe and industry to identify: critical challenges in materials development, existing and emerging computational and experimental techniques that have the potential to facilitate rational materials design in new ways, and best working practices for collaborative research between industry and universities and understand how they may be exploited to facilitate materials design and the accelerated development of new materials.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop will also involve identifying approaches to storing, sharing, interrogating, and using the increasingly voluminous quantities of data generated by computational and experimental materials research.  The organizers will seek the participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering by leveraging activities with their existing support programs at Brown.",
