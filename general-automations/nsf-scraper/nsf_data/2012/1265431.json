 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: In this project, biochemical assays and yeast genetics will be employed to understand how DNA replication is initiated in eukaryotes.  This project will focus on two proteins that are required for the initiation of DNA replication, Sld2 and Sld3.  Sld2 and Sld3 are essential for DNA replication initiation, but these two proteins are not involved in replication once the process of duplicating DNA has begun.  Little is currently known about how Sld2 and Sld3 trigger the initiation of DNA replication.  The research project will capitalize on observations discovered in the PI's lab that Sld3 binds to the Mcm2-7 complex, a protein assembly that actively unwinds double-helical DNA during the process of DNA replication.  The research project will also capitalize on observations discovered in the PI's lab that Sld2 and Sld3 bind to single-stranded DNA that is found at the origin of DNA replication (i.e., where DNA replication starts).   This research project will help our understanding of how DNA replication is initiated in a eukaryotic organism.\r\nBroader Impacts:  The PI will work with the Vanderbilt University Center for Science Outreach to teach DNA replication to high school students, and this program will be for high school students from underrepresented backgrounds and ethnicities. The curriculum unit will focus on the PI's research on budding yeast proteins Sld2 and Sld3 and their relationship with initiation of DNA replication.  In the curriculum, basic concepts will be covered such as DNA structure, replication, and sequencing.  The curriculum will also include a laboratory with an in vitro selection of random ssDNA with Sld2, based upon preliminary data suggesting that Sld2 binds to thymine-rich ssDNA.  Vanderbilt's Outreach staff will help implement the performance of this teaching program, and the evaluation of this program will be conducted by an external evaluator.  The PI will also work with Vanderbilt's Outreach staff to adapt the high school student curriculum into a professional development curriculum for area teachers.  This work will raise the scientific literacy of high school students in the Nashville Metropolitan area.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n DNA replication is a fundamental process in all life forms, since a precise copy of DNA must be produced before a cell can divide.  DNA replication is divided into three steps: initiation, eloongation, and termination.  Of these three steps, the first one, initiaiton, is the most highly regulated.  We are using budding yeast as a model system to study DNA replication because the process of DNA replication is conserved from yeast to human, and yeast are easy to study with biochemical and genetic tools.  In budding yeast, three proteins are essential for initiation of DNA replication, referred to as Sld2, Sld3, and Dpb11.  We studied the role of Sld2, Sld3 and Dpb11 on DNA replication initiation with the money provided by this award.  We found that Sld2, Sld3, and Dpb11  regulate the assembly and activation of the replication fork helicase.  The replication fork helicase unwinds double-stranded DNA at a replication fork, providing single-stranded DNA tempates for the replication polymerases, which copy the DNA.  The replication fork helicase is the target of regulation by Sld2, Sld3, and Dpb11 because once the cell is committed to unwinding double-helical DNA, it is committed to copying that DNA.\n\n We found that Sld2, Sld3, and Dpb11 bind to single-stranded DNA during replicaiton initaition, and this interaction is required for DNA replication.  We also found that Sld2, Sld3, and Dpb11  bind to the motor of the replication fork helicase during initiation.  The function of Sld2, Sld3, and Dpb11 binding to the motor of the replication fork helicase (called Mcm2-7) is to block the premature association of the motor of the replication fork helicase with the replication fork helicase activator (called GINS).  Interestingly, when Sld2, Sld3, or Dpb11 binds single-stranded DNA, the interaction between Sld2, Sld3, or Dpb11 and the replication fork helicase motor is lost.  This sophisticated mechanism for helicase assembly ensures that once single-stranded DNA is formed, the Sld2, Sld3, and Dpb11 proteins release from the motor of the replication fork helicase, and the motor of the replication fork hellicase (Mcm2-7) can then bind to one of the activators of the replication fork helicase (GINS) by a passive, sequestration mechanism.\n\n We also found that Sld3 helps recruit Cdc45, a second activator of the replication fork helicase, to the motor of the replication fork helicase (Mcm2-7).  There are also two cell cycle kinases that trigger the initation of DNA replication, called the Dbf4-dependent kianse (Dbf4) and the S-phase cyclin dependent kinase (S-CDK).  Kinases are proteins that add phosphate groups to other proteins.  We found, surprisingly, that Sld3 also stimulates the Dbf4-dependent kinase phosphorylation of Mcm2, a subunit of the motor of the replication fork helicase.  Moreover, we found the function of Dbf4-dependent kinase phosphorylation of Mcm2 is to activate ring-opening of the replication fork helicase toroidal-shaped motor, Mcm2-7.  This process may be important for allowing for the extrusion of single-stranded DNA from the central channel of Mcm2-7 during replication initiation.   The replication fork helicase must remodel its arrangement with DNA during the initiation of DNA replication to prepare the replication fork helicase for active unwinding.  Thus, Sld3 is a master conductor of replication, coordinating the assembly of the replication fork helicase with the phosphorylation of the replication fork helicase.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel L Kaplan"
