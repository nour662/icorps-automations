The conference brings together leading experts from academia, industry, and national laboratories on the topic of defects in bulk and nanostructured semiconductor material systems. The meeting contributes to the further development and advancement of the fundamental understanding of defects and their roles in the structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of bulk, thin film, and nanoscale semiconductors and device structures. Point and extended defects are addressed in a broad range of electronic materials of current interest, including wide bandgap semiconductors, metal-oxides, carbon-based semiconductors (e.g., diamond, graphene), organic semiconductors, photovoltaic/solar cell materials, and others of similar interest. The NSF funds are used mainly to provide financial support for graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty members, especially from under-represented groups.",
