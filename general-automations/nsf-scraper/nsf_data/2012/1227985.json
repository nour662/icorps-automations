 "awd_abstract_narration": "Justice and rule-of-law measures have often been touted as a solution to prevent the resumption\r\nof violence following conflict; yet little work has been undertaken to understand the prevalence\r\nof these practices while conflict remains ongoing. These measures include trials, truth\r\ncommissions, reparations, as well as alternative accountability processes such as amnesties,\r\npurges, and exiles. While existing research has focused on the implementation of justice\r\nprocesses once conflict has ended, pilot data by the PIs suggests that these same practices are\r\noften implemented during violence. The current state of the literature provides little theoretical\r\nunderstanding as to when and why during-conflict justice processes are implemented and their\r\nlikely effect on the duration of conflict and durability of peace.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates the implementation of during-conflict justice to understand which\r\nprocesses, if any, a government implements during internal armed conflicts and in which\r\ncontexts such processes are pursued. Through the collection of a new cross-national dataset\r\ncovering the implementation of justice measures during all civil wars since the Second World\r\nWar, this research greatly improves our understanding of the presence of during-conflict justice\r\nand expands the current state of research on both the implementation of justice processes and the\r\ndynamics of conflict more broadly. This project provides an evidentiary basis to determine the\r\nconditions under which implementation is more likely, to facilitate the development of these\r\nconditions in countries that may benefit from justice measures and to prevent the development of\r\ncircumstances detracting from these goals. Furthermore, the results of this research will be used\r\nto understand the potential misuses of justice measures for goals not related to conflict resolution\r\nand promotion of the rule-of-law, leading to more effective conflict termination strategies and\r\nshortening the duration of civil conflict.",
