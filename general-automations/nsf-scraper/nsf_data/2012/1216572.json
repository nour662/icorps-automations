 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V Atlantic Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel operated by Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.\r\n\r\n The R/V Atlantic Explorer is a general-purpose research ship owned and operated by the\r\nBermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS). BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the island of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research. The RV Atlantic Explorer has 157 days funded in 2012 and 150 days in 2011. All 157 days are NSF science days. With this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation Equipment: \r\n\r\n1)\tFERRUPS UPCS system\t$17,000\r\n2)\tUpgrades for the shipboard IP/Data network\t$16,400\r\n3)\tBottom Finding Pinger\t$15,600\r\n                          TOTAL \t$49,000\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\tThe principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",
