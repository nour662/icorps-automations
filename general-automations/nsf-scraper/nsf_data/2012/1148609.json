 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rice University has a dynamic geometry group, with senior faculty in low- dimensional topology; quasi-crystals, spectral theory, and mathematical physics; geometric measure theory; algebraic and complex geometry; and Teichmueller theory and minimal surfaces.  This project will support a Research Training Group led by these faculty, involving undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.  Our main objective is to increase the number of students and postdocs pursuing independent research in geometry, as well as related areas of topology and analysis.\r\n\r\nGeometric problems stimulate progress across almost every subfield of mathematics.  The study of conic sections initiated by the ancient Greeks spurred the development of coordinate systems and polynomial algebra in the 17th century, leading to the modern field of algebraic geometry.  The desire to find curves and surfaces minimizing the energy of physical systems motivated the development of calculus.  More recently, geometric questions about knots and links have led to numerous advances in modern algebra.  Thus geometric examples offer common ground where specialists in different areas can exchange ideas and techniques.  The Geometry Group at Rice builds on this common ground to train students and postdoctoral fellows in the methods of mathematical research.\r\n\r\n",
