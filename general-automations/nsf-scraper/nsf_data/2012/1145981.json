 "awd_abstract_narration": "In some species of fish, males contract and relax muscles which surround the gas-filled swimbladder at 100 Hz and up to 250 Hz to produce a mating call. Calcium (Ca2+), the switch for muscle contraction, is released from and pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticuluum on each stimulus. The rapid contractions would seem to require a prodigious Ca2+ pumping rate. However the Ca2+ pumps are not very fast. Toadfish solve the Ca2+ problem in two ways: (1) Toadfish reduce the amount of Ca2+ released per stimulus and thus require less pumping. (2) Toadfish do not call continuously, they make 400 ms calls followed by a long 5-15 second intercall interval (i.e., 3-8% duty cycle calls). Toadfish possess a protein, parvalbumin (Parv), in very high concentrations which binds 70-80% of the Ca2+ released during a call. Parv then releases the Ca2+ slowly during the long intercall interval and it is pumped back at a modest rate. Another fish species, the midshipman, make a 100% duty cycle call and a single call can last 1 hour. Without the intercall interval to unload Ca2+, Parv cannot be useful. Accordingly, midshipman have only 1/7 of the Parv as toadfish. This leaves the problem: how can midshipman call?  This research project will examine how much Ca2+ is released per stimulus, how the Ca2+ level changes during calling, and whether midshipman possess a means of performing mechanical work with little release and reuptake of Ca2+-utilizing a mechanism (asynchronous contraction) observed in insects, but never before seen in vertebrate muscle. The work will utilize innovative energetic analyses, high speed intracellular Ca2+ and high speed mechanics/video techniques (20,000 frames/s) developed by the collaborators. Toadfish and midshipman share neural mechanisms with birds and mammals and thus this work will improve our understanding of how vocal communication evolved. Also, extreme function usually involves extreme modifications, and thus studies of these extreme muscles will reveal new mechanisms that are not visible in normal muscle.  This project will include mentoring underrepresented minority undergraduates through a REU program at the MBL in Woods Hole. In addition 1 or 2 undergraduate students from the PI's physiology and advanced muscle/biomechanics class will be given the opportunity to work on the project in Philadelphia and Woods Hole.",

Although one might anticipate marked structural and physiological differences underlying muscles abilities to perform these different tasks, to a first approximation, all vertebrate skeletal twitch fibers share the same basic structure and operate by the same contractile mechanism. There are, however, a number of important qualitative modifications as well as quantitative modifications within muscle fibers, which underlie many of these differences in performance.</p>\n<p>In this study, we focused on the superfast toadfish and midshipman swimbladder muscles which are the fastest of all vertebrate muscles. Unlike the mammalian sound production system, where air is blown over a vibrating structure (i.e. vocal cords), in fish, muscle surrounds the swimbladder (gas-filled organ) and there is a one for one sound pulse per muscle contraction. Hence a 200 Hz mating call by the toadfish requires the swimbladder muscle to contract and relax at 200 times per second. We focused on calcium movements in these muscles. Calcium turns the muscle on when its released from an internal store (Sarcoplasmic Reticulum-SR) and the muscle relaxes when the calcium is pumped back into the SR. Turning a muscle on and off at up to 200 times per second seems like an almost impossible feat.</p>\n<p>By measuring the calcium movements, we discovered that although a large amount of calcium is released during the first stimulus, the amount released on the subsequent 50-100 contractions that make up a call was greatly reduced (by 90%). Further, although the total calcium released during a call is significant (lasts 0.3 to 0.8 seconds), we found that the calcium released is temporarily stored by the large amount of Ca-binding protein, Parvalbumin. We further found that the Parvalbumin becomes nearly saturated during normal calls. However, the calcium unbinds from Parvalbumin and is pumped back into the SR in between calls (the 5-10 s inter-call interval) so that the muscle would be ready for the next call. If larger amounts of calcium were released or the call went on for much longer, the muscle would not be able to relax and produce sound. &nbsp;Hence, this Parvalbumin mechanism essentially shapes the calling behavior of fish (see Figure. 1). &nbsp;It should be noted that Parvalbumin is found in many muscles and nerve cells, but it is only in the toadfish swimbladder muscle where there is so much of it (most of any animal) that we could observe how it works.</p>\n<p>We also found that Parvalbumin \"can't save the day\" in all cases. A related species of fish, the Midshipman, make calls at 100 Hz for as much as an hour. That represents 360,000 muscle contractions in a row without stopping (see Figure 2). Because there is no ?intercall interval,? there would be no chance to pump calcium off of Parvalbumin during the hour-long call. Thus midshipman can?t use Parvalbumin as it would become quickly saturated. Hence we found that they have very little Parvalbumin (only about 1/8 of that found in toadfish). &nbsp;We discovered that Midshipman muscle handles the calcium problem by releasing very little per stimulus (1/10 of that in toadfish). It is so small that the midshipman muscle can pump it back into the SR in real time and that permits them to perform 360,000 contractions in a row. However, this raises the next question of how they can get their muscle to activate and relax while such a small amount of calcium is being released and pumped back? we hypothesize that both the enlarged Z-bands and the inflated swimbladder are necessary to permit the muscle to produce the long calls observed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts</p>\n<p>I Mentored Postdoc Frank Nelson (currently professor at Temple) and Postdoc Coen Elemans (currently professor at Southern Denmark)</p>\n<p>I am involved in informing the public through various media opportunities which the fish research generates.
