 "awd_abstract_narration": "What effects do steroids like androgens have on the behavior and reproductive success of organisms?  Traditionally, gonads are assumed to be the source of circulating androgens, thereby regulating behavior.  Often, however, behavioral changes in response to the environment can be rapid and thus precede changes in circulating androgens.  This raises the question as to whether brain-derived androgens are important in regulating behavior. \r\n\r\nA particularly fascinating phenomenon is seen in Bluebanded Gobies (Lythrypnus dalli), coral-dwelling fish that inhabit waters off the coast of Santa Catalina Island.  These fish exhibit a haremic social structure, in which one large male dominates a group of females.  If the male leaves the group, the most dominant female dramatically increases her aggressive and territorial behavior, and transforms into the male.  The male provides paternal care by fanning eggs and defending them against predators. This research will address the role of brain androgens in regulating two life-history stages: reproductive transformation and male parenting.  \r\n\r\nAdvanced resources will facilitate an integrative, organism-level approach, including biochemistry, androgen implants, brain pharmacological injections, and hormone measurements, all used within the context of in-depth behavioral observations of wild-caught fish in a semi-natural laboratory setting.  Findings are expected to reveal that the brain (rather than gonads) is the predominant source of elevated androgens for the regulation of stereotyped behavioral patterns during life-history transitions.\r\n\r\nThe results of these experiments will lay a foundation for understanding social behavior as well as cellular and molecular mechanisms driven by steroids.  This work will involve the participation of undergraduate minority students who will learn valuable lab techniques and critical thinking skills.  Through education outreach activities, findings of this research will be shared in association with the Center for Behavioral Neuroscience, Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies and the Georgia Aquarium.",
