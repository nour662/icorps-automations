 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Dana Vogtmann of University of Maryland, College Park to conduct a research project, entitled \"Comparison of two manufacturing processes for small scale robotics,\" during the summer of 2012 at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea.  The host scientist is Dr. Kyujin Cho.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in a comparison of different manufacturing methods for making meso-scale robots, which are on the order of a several millimeters to a few centimeters in size.  Robots this size are a relatively new invention.  This project is a first step toward a better understanding of the individual strengths and weaknesses of these methods.  As the merits of different manufacturing methods are made more transparent, it will be easier for future developers to make a decision on which method to use, and go on to make their own innovations in the field without this difficulty.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
