 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Howard University HBCU-UP Broadening Participation Research in STEM Education project is entitled Broadening STEM Participation of African American Males. The proposed project is designed to use the Engagement, Capacity and Continuity (ECC) theory to address issues associated with the underrepresentation of African American males in STEM. The objectives are to (1) identify the relationship between mathematics achievement and race-by-gender, engagement, capacity, and continuity variables and (2) develop, validate, and administer a psychometrically sound instrument that describes the ECC characteristics and experiences of African American males majoring in STEM disciplines. The proposal responds to recent calls for research specifically focused on African American males in STEM to help inform practice.\r\n\r\nUsing the ECC Trilogy for Student Success as the theoretical framework, the study is designed to identify factors that facilitate or serve as barriers to African American males' interest, experiences, and success in STEM disciplines. It will employ a two-phased approach to test the hypotheses: Phase 1 will examine relationships between race-by-gender interactions and ECC-related factors on math achievement using data from the Department of Education High School Longitudinal Study of 2009. Phase 2 will use the results and findings of Phase 1 to develop, validate, and administer an instrument to examine ECC characteristics and experiences of African American males majoring in STEM disciplines to ascertain the relationship between the instrument results and undergraduate STEM achievement. The project's potentially transformative influence lies in its ability to disentangle the issues of race and gender and their relationship to factors found to influence STEM interest and success. The findings could be especially useful to major research universities facing race/ethnicity and gender issues in their recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in STEM.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis study set out to broaden the participation of African American males in STEM fields by developing a psychometrically sound instrument (the PBOSS survey) which would predict the selection of a STEM major by African American male college students at Innovations University. In addition, the PBOSS was to predict their enrollment in pre-Calculus or Calculus. The Score on the PBOSS was a measure of the college students? reflections on their high school experiences in math and science.  After major revisions, the hybrid model which was developed successfully achieved this goal of predicting Black males selecting STEM majors and enrollment in pre-calculus or calculus (Figures 2, 3, and 4), however, several important questions, limitations and suggestions for future study are raised by the study.\n\n1.            Though the study initially focused on Black males only, since data on Black females was also collected, it was possible to determine that there was no statistically significantly difference in the outcomes for Black males vs. females.  Thus, the results for both were reported and could be collapsed.\n\n2.            The capacity factor in the four factor hybrid model was dropped because of inadequate items to capture this concept in the survey items selected for while developing the PBOSS.  This limitation is important because of the role in U.S. education of tracking minority students into lower level math and science courses thus robbing them of timely preparation for higher level courses in these disciplines.  Future research in this area is encouraged to include tasks which measure capacity (a component of Jolly?s et al. model, as acquired knowledge and skills to advance to rigorous quantitative content)\n\n3.            Another limitation was the overall availability of items in HSLS: 09 which matched the four factors of the model and the extent to which the HSLS:09 (or 11) items selected adequately represented the factors they were intended to capture. Future research should provide a better match between the factors and the items for the survey.\n\n4.            The fact that Innovation University was the only university involved and those students are not representative of all Black students suggests that future studies should include other Black students at other HBCUs and predominately White Universities.\n\n5.            The model of factors in this study that affect Black participation in STEM based on Jolly, et.al, 2004 and Boykin and Noguera, 2011, was subjected to empirical verification through survey analysis of items selected from an existing survey to measure the four concepts.  The study found limitations in the ability of this model proposed model to predict student STEM course selection.  As an example, a subcomponent of the engagement factor, vocational engagement, was used.  Further conceptual development and measurement methods for a modified model are needed as refinement of the model.  The study results provide guidance on how to revise the measurement of these four concepts.\n\n6.            The contribution of this study to the present literature on broadening participation of Black males in STEM is to be able to predict the necessary and sufficient factors for STEM major selection in college by Black students based on their high school experiences. \n\n \n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vinetta C Jones"
