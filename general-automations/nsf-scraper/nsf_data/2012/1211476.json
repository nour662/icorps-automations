 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. de Lucia and his team address the problem of the large incompleteness of millimeter and submillimeter (mm/submm) astrophysical catalogs.  Theoretical work and laboratory spectra are needed to make optimal analysis of the data from ALMA and other mm/submm observatories.  The work here aims to complete the spectroscopic survey of 8 \"weed\" molecules in the ALMA early science bands and to develop a database that will reduce the number of unidentifiable lines in astronomical spectral surveys. \r\nIt is a continuation of previous work that is based on analyses of about 1000 intensity calibrated mm/submm spectra taken over a range of temperatures for each molecule. The accuracy of the results is validated by studying eight major interstellar weeds. The previous results revealed the incompleteness is the astrophysical data base and the researchers provided theoretical explanations to show the incompleteness as a function of source temperature. The objectives of this work are to develop a new approach for the characterization of mm/submm molecular spectra. Characterization of the complete spectra is done through analysis of the measured temperature dependence of intensities, together with quantum mechanical analyses for subsets of the spectra used for reference. Including the intensity calibration of complete spectra will substantially improve spectral catalogs and help to address the astrophysical \"weed and clutter\" problems in millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy.  As part of this project, graduate students are trained in experimental millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy, and in developing methods for archiving and disseminating the results.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMillimeter and submillimeter molecular astronomy is a rapidly growing area, with a number of new telescopes, such as ALMA, coming on line.  The targets of these telescopes are the molecular clouds around active star forming regions.\n\n \n\nThe purpose of this project is to provide a scientific basis for the understanding of the results obtained by these powerful new systems.  The methodology of this work is to use laboratory experimental and theoretical techniques to develop reference spectra which in turn are used to understand the molecular content and physical and chemical conditions within these clouds.  Of particular interest are the dynamics of the gas flows that are involved in this star formation.  There is also broad interest in the unique low temperature chemistry that leads to the molecular formation.\n\n \n\nInitially, the conventional wisdom was that molecules would be rare in the interstellar medium:  It was too cold and too rarified for efficient formation chemistry and even if molecules were formed, the ultraviolet flux would destroy them.  To the contrary, more than 100 species have been identified and explained based on new low temperature and grain surface chemistry and the shielding effects of dust in these clouds.  As a result, the astrophysical experiments have gone from expecting little if any molecular spectra to observing spectra of great complexity. Moreover, much of these spectra is so far unassignable because of the incompleteness of the quantum mechanical (QM) spectral line catalog.  This leads to the so-called ?weeds? problem.  An important aspect of this problem is that any unassigned weed can be mistaken for a ?new? molecule.  This project is focused on removing these weeds by assigning them to their parent molecule.  Figure 1 shows an example of a crowded region and our simulation of this region.  Many of the laboratory lines are not contained the he QM catalogs, thus making them weeds.\n\n \n\nBriefly stated, the foundation of the ?weeds? problem is the existence of low energy vibrational states which are challenging to quantum mechanical analysis because of the perturbations that couple them.  To address this challenge, we have developed a technique that we refer to as the Complete Experimental Spectrum (CES), which allows us to simulate the astrophysical spectrum over the wide range of astrophysical temperatures without QM analysis.  It is based on an analysis of intensity calibrated laboratory spectra taken over a wide range of temperatures.\n\n \n\nFigure 2 shows some weed molecules with internal motion (CH3 or OH groups) and others that have low lying vibrational bends. Because they are major contributors to the weeds problem, we have focused on methyl formate, methanol, dimethyl ether, ethyl cyanide, vinyl cyanide, and methyl cyanide, which are abundant in the interstellar medium and have strong, dense, and difficult to theoretically characterize spectra. Figure 3 shows in a small region how these six molecules contribute to this spectral congestion.  Figure 4 show a region rich in methyl formate lines.  This figure shows the incompleteness of the QM catalog (downward pointing green sticks) in comparison to the astrophysical spectrum and the CES (upward pointing green sticks).  The lines in the ALMA spectrum that are not accounted for by the CES methyl formate catalog belong to other molecules present in the interstellar medium.\n\n \n\n \n\nIn the analysis of astrophysical spectra, lines and other features are often characterized in terms of single lines, which are typically assumed to be Gaussian.  We have extended our CES to modeling on a point-by-point (not line-by-line) basis to the astrophysical spectra.  This eliminates the assumption of isolated Gaussian lines and makes possible a considerably more accurate calculation of the astrophysical spectrum.  Figure 5 shows an example of the complexity of lineshapes observed:  a collection of unblended single lines of methyl cyanide.  This large variation arises from the complex Doppler shifts of the molecules in the clouds, coupled with optical depth effects.  The accuracy and generality of this approach is such that even complex blended regions can be simulated, as shown in Fig. 6.  In his case, well over half of the ethyl cyanide lines that contribute to these features are not included in the QM catalogs.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frank C De Lucia"
