The host scientist is Professor Chuanlai Xu.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to develop a new approach for misfolded protein detection that takes advantage of unique properties of nanoparticle assemblies, and existing knowledge of protein detection on nanoparticle assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
