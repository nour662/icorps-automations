 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this work, funded by the Macromolecular, Supermolecular and Nanochemistry Program, Prof. Amy Walker of the University of Texas at Dallas and her students will extend and apply a new technique for growing nanowires at precise locations. Electroless Nanowire Deposition On Micropatterned substrates (ENDOM) can create nanowires that are centimeters in length and follow complex paths. In ENDOM, a multifunctional micropatterned surface is used to direct the growth of nanowires by electroless deposition (ELD). ENDOM is an in situ method and does not require complex lithography, both significant advantages over other methods for nanowire synthesis and placement.  ENDOM protocols will be developed for making copper, silver, nickel, palladium and gold nanowires. The mechanisms underlying ENDOM, in particular the interaction of ELD reactants with the terminal functional groups in organic thin films, will be studied in detail, so that the method can be further extended to nanowires of other compositions and to different substrates.  Practical applications of ENDOM will include the fabrication of nanowire sensors for the detection of hydrogen and ammonia, and the construction of crossbar circuits for nanoelectronics.\r\n \r\nThis research program will substantially advance the state-of-the-art in nanotechnology by enabling the integration of nanowires in practical devices. The program advances the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students by providing experience in electrochemistry, device design, nanoscience, materials characterization, spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Students involved will gain skills valuable in many industries, allowing them to choose from a variety of careers. Progress will be disseminated through presentations at international and national conferences, publication in high-impact factor journals, and to the general public via participation in programs run by the UT Dallas Office of Diversity and Community Engagement. Undergraduate students will participate in the research activities through a summer REU program run by UT Dallas.",
