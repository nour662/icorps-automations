 "awd_abstract_narration": "Macro molecular complexes that act as nano-scale machines provide the\r\nfunction of biological systems. Understanding the geometry and functioning of\r\nthe complex as a machine, for instance, how do the various parts move relative\r\nto each other, is a central goal of biology. Cryo electron microscopy provides\r\none noisy image of each of many (e.g., 100,000) instances of the complex. The\r\nobjective of this research is to compute a statistical description of the machine\r\nfrom the images and then compute a mechanical model of the machine from\r\nthe statistical description. Understanding how existing complexes function is\r\ncentral to engineering changes in their function. Achieving changes would have\r\nbroad impact, for instance, in cancer treatment (inhibiting complexes that pro-\r\ntect tumor cells by pumping chemotherapy drugs out of tumor cells) and in\r\nimproving the efficiency of complexes involved in the production of biofuels.\r\nFurther impacts include the training of two Ph.D. students who will come from a diverse pool of students.\r\n\r\nThe complex in question will be described as a weighted sum of basis functions with random\r\nGaussian weights. A maximum likelihood estimator is used to estimate the\r\nmean and covariance of the weights. The estimator is computed by an expecta-\r\ntion maximization algorithm which requires substantial computation due to the\r\nunknown projection directions of the images. A \"spring and mass\" mechanical\r\nmodel in thermodynamic equilibrium predicts the mean and covariance. By\r\ncomparing the predictions of the mechanical model to the estimated mean and\r\ncovariance by Kullback-Leibler divergence, the parameters in the mechanical\r\nmodel are estimated.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSingle-particle cryo electron microscopy is an experimental method for imaging biological objects ranging in size from protein molecules to large macromolecular complexes such as viruses or ribosomes.  One image of each of many different instances of the same object are combined by computation to determine the 3-D shape of the object.  The shape is important to understanding the function of the object, for instance, the functioning of the Zika virus.\n\nThis project concerns new algorithms and software for performing the computation.  Even when each instance of the object has exactly the same molecule(s), there is typically variability in the shape of the object, for instance, the object can be flexible.  The new aspect of the algorithms and software is the ability to characterize the variability of the object, in the hope that understanding the variability will contribute to understanding how the object functions.\n\nThe work supported by the grant is in collaboration with Prof. John E. Johnson (The Scripps Research Institute) with whom the Principal Investigator has collaborated since about 1990-1991.  Most of the budget in the grant funded Graduate Research Assistantships for two Ph.D. students in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University.  After receiving her B.S. degree at the University of Rochester, Nan Xu received her Ph.D. degree in May 2017 and is now a postdoc at Georgia Institute of Technology.  After receiving her B.S. degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Yunye Gong continues to work toward her Ph.D. under other funding and will probably receive the degree in May 2019.  The primary Broader Impacts of the grant are in the area of work-force development, specifically financial support for the two Ph.D. students and enabling the Principal Investigator to continue his long and productive collaboration with Professor Johnson.\n\nThe object is described by a Fourier Series in 3-D where the coefficients in the series are unknown but the basis functions in the series are known.  Rather than determining the numerical value of the coefficients from the image data, the approach of this grant is to determine the joint probability density function (pdf) of the coefficients.  Then each object is described by an independent realization of the coefficients.  Because it is necessary to use at least thousands of coefficients in order to achieve adequate spatial resolution in the 3-D shape of the object, the approach of this grant is to assume that the coefficients are jointly Gaussian since this transforms probability calculations into linear algebra calculations.  With the Gaussian assumption, what must be determined is the mean vector and covariance matrix of the vector of coefficients.  An important part of the Intellectual Merit of the grant is further developing foundational methods in information and signal processing to solve this important biological problem.  The result is that the mean vector and the covariance matrix are estimated by a maximimum-likelihood estimator computed using a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm.\n\nSymmetry is an important aspect of many biological objects.  A second important part of the Intellectual Merit of the grant is to understand how to estimate pdfs on the Fourier Series coefficients when there is a symmetry requirement on the function that is represented by the Fourier Series.  The approach that we have used is to assume that the symmetry applies to the moments of the function represented by the Fourier Series.  The result is that the requirement can be achieved by constraining the mean vector of the Fourier Series coefficients so that only certain elements can be non zero and by much more complicated constraints on the covariance matrix of the Fourier Series coefficients.  These constraints were then built into the maximum-likelihood estimator and generalized expectation-maximization algorithm of the previous paragraph.  The mathematics used to describe symmetry is group theory.  The symmetry part of the grant also lead to a Broader Impact contribution because the Principal Investigator greatly enlarged his understanding of group theory, especially representation theory for finite groups.\n\nIn collaboration with Professor Johnson, the algorithms and software developed in this grant have been used to study the lifecycle of viruses of interest in Professor Johnson's laboratory.  For instance, in the bacteriophage HK97, these algorithms and software were able to demonstrate that the virally-encoded protease causes a significant increase in the stability of the capsid of the HK97 even though the 3-D shape of the capsid was not changed (Yunye Gong, David Veesler, Peter C. Doerschuk, John E. Johnson, Journal of Structural Biology, vol. 193, pp. 188&ndash;195, 2016).\n\nA further Broader Impact of the grant is that all of the software (about 10,000 lines of multi-core Matlab) is available (open source) from the Principal Investigator.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/25/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter C Doerschuk"
