 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies an approximation methodology known as mean field equilibrium (MFE), \r\nwhich can be used for management, design, and control of large dynamic economic systems \r\nsuch as financial markets, power markets, sponsored search auctions, online marketplaces,\r\nand resource sharing systems such as cloud computing platforms.  \r\nIn a mean field equilibrium, individuals \r\npostulate that fluctuations in the empirical distribution of other\r\nplayers' states have \"averaged out\" due to large scale, and thus\r\noptimize holding the state distribution of other players fixed.  \r\nMFE simplifies system description, making optimization, design, and\r\ncontrol possible.  Such a simplification in the equilibrium concept\r\ndelivers the best of both worlds: not only is it more believable, but\r\nit provides a tool to understand the impact of parameter and design\r\nchanges on the performance of these complex dynamic systems.  This\r\nproject develops methods to mathematically characterize regimes where MFE\r\nis a viable equilibrium concept, as well as to develop algorithms to\r\ncompute and learn MFE.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the research results could be employed in practice\r\nto leverage the huge advances in computation and availability of big data \r\ngenerated by complex economic systems for developing\r\nmore structured and principled prediction of the impact of design\r\nchanges.  In support of this goal, the project includes efforts to make MFE\r\ntechniques accessible to engineering students through educational\r\nmaterials and course curriculum.\r\n\r\n",
