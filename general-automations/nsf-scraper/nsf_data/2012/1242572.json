 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central question in neuroscience is understanding the mechanisms by which genes influence behavior. Using model organisms that have genes that can be easily manipulated is critical to gaining a better understanding of how genetic polymorphisms contribute to complex phenotypes. Past work has shown that the innate food preferences of the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, vary in different strains. The project focuses on understanding how natural genetic polymorphisms influence food preferences as well as the neuronal basis of food preference. The project has three aims: 1) determine the mechanism by which the identified F-box gene modifies bacterial preference behavior; 2) identify additional causative genes underlying other previously determined QTLs; 3) determine the neuronal circuits underlying discrimination among complex odors released by a wide range of bacteria likely to be found in the natural environment of C. elegans. This project will provide insights into the genetic and neuronal mechanisms by which C. elegans generates its responses to different complex stimuli, and into the relationship between the genome and behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will study how genes can influence complex behaviors such as food preference using the C. elegans model organism. The research will be conducted primarily by undergraduates at Harvey Mudd College.  Students will participate in all aspects of the research, including designing and conducting experiments, analyzing data, presenting their work at on-campus research symposia as well as national scholarly meetings and preparing their work for publication.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe nervous system allows animals to generate an array of behaviors from escaping predation to finding food.  The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans uses chemosensation to distinguish among various species of bacteria, their major food source.  Although the neurons required for the detection of specific food-odors have been well defined, less is known about the sensory circuits underlying the discrimination among the mixtures of odors released by bacteria. The proposed project focused on understanding the neuronal basis of food preference in C. elegans. We examined the neural machinery underlying bacterial preference among a diverse set of bacterial species found in the natural habitats of C. elegans (kindly provided by Marie-Anne Felix).  We have found that C. elegans strongly prefers the odors of Providencia sp., Alcaligenes sp., and Flavobacteria sp. to Escherichia coli HB101, a commonly used food source for C. elegans.  We have identified that an olfactory neuron named AWC is necessary for these preferences.  In the future we plan to extend our analysis to other bacterial species to determine the diversity of the underlying neuronal mechanisms.\n \nBroader Impacts:\nThis project provided insights into the neuronal mechanisms that animals use to generate behavioral responses to different complex stimuli.\n \nThis work was completed at a liberal arts college and was performed by mentored undergraduate researchers.  This grant allowed for the training of twenty-three undergraduate students in the planning and conducting of experiments as well as the analysis and interpretation of results.  Four students, including one African-American woman, presented their research at national conferences.  One student is pursuing a doctoral degree in molecular biology and several senior undergraduates are applying to graduate school in biology-related fields this year.   \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth Glater"
