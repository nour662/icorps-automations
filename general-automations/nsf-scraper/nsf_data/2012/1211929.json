 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide continuing support for the operations of Georgia State University's Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA), which operates an optical/near infrared interferometric array on Mount Wilson, CA.  Since beginning operations in 2004, CHARA observations have led to a number of new, fundamental measurements, including the first direct detection of gravity darkening on a single star, the first detection of hot exozodiacal dust around a main-sequence star, the first measurement of an exoplanets stellar host diameter and hence the linear diameter of its transiting planet, the first angular diameter for a low-metallicity star in the galactic halo, the first direct image of a short-period interacting binary, and the first image of a binary star system in eclipse.  With continued funding, the array will advance the development of optical and infrared interferometry the measurement of stellar angular diameters, which when combined with photometry yield effective temperatures and with parallaxes yield linear diameters.  Interferometry will also be used to measure stellar shapes, detect circumstellar disks and envelopes, and resolve binary stars to determine stellar masses and probe features of interacting systems.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a significant potential scientific impact in many areas of stellar astrophysics, the project will contribute to the training of the next generation of experts in the field of interferometry.  Data products and the techniques of interferometry will be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum at Georgia State University, and the research team will continue their efforts in informal education and public outreach efforts.",

The Array consists of six telescopes, each with a light-collecting mirror 1 meter in diameter. The telescopes are linked together under ultra-precise circumstances of optical interferometry enabling the light from each telescope to \"interfere\" with every other telescope to provide the ability to see extremely small detail in objects, i.e. achieve extraordinarily high resolution, equivalent to that of a single telescope 400 meters across. The CHARA Array can see detail on the surfaces of stars at the fraction of a milli-arcsecond level. This is as if measuring the angular size of a nickel from 15,000 kilometers away.</p>\n<p>In order to understand how stars are formed, live out their lives burning hydrogen in their interior thermonuclear furnaces, and then die to form stellar relics, it is necessary to measure their physical properties in order to develop a theoretical understanding of their life cycles. These properties include their size, surface temperatures, masses, and luminosities. CHARA's high resolution is permitting the measurement of stellar diameters across the entire stellar age spectrum. From these diameters and the measure of the amount of light pouring from their surfaces, the interferometry results also yield temperatures. The body of these new results will have a major impact on the theories of stellar structure and evolution.</p>\n<p>In addition, and for the first time, images of the surfaces of stars are revealing the oblate shapes of rapidly rotating stars as well as spots on the surfaces of giant stars. Images of close pairs of stars, in which matter is streaming from one member of the gravitationally-bound binary system to the other, clearly show phenomena that had long been inferred, but never before seen, by other observational techniques. CHARA observations are also delineating so-called \"habitable zones\" around stars containing planets, detecting the subtle signatures of \"exo-zodiacal dust\" surrounding stars that may harbor planets or are in the process of forming them. CHARA has imaged the detonation of a nova, measured the pulsations of Cepheid variable stars that serve to set the cosmic distance scale, and resolved binary star systems with periods as short at 1.4 days. This is only a sample of the exciting science being accomplished from this facility, which is located on the grounds of the historic Mount Wilson Observatory in the San Gabriel Mountains overlooking the Los Angeles basin.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the CHARA website at www.chara.gsu.edu.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Harold&nbsp;A&nbsp;Mcalister</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1211929/1211929_10188667_1540123583410_Layout--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1211929/1211929_10188667_1540123583410_Layout--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CHARA Layout\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1211929/1211929_10188667_1540123583410_Layout--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CHARA Layout\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CHARA Array facilities are shown in black border lines as they appear on Mount Wilson, California.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Georgia State University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Harold&nbsp;A&nbsp;Mcalister</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CHARA Layout</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1211929/1211929_10188667_1540123756233_Lab--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1211929/1211929_10188667_1540123756233_Lab--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Beam Combining Laboratory\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1211929/1211929_10188667_1540123756233_Lab--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Beam Combining Laboratory\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Interferometry requires bringing light beams from pairs of telescopes together with an accuracy at the 1 micron (0.001 mm) level.
