 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe Princeton-CEFRC Summer School in Combustion is an intensive one-week seminar series held annually at Princeton University, during which advanced graduate students and researchers in combustion and energy will take two courses of 15 hours each. The participants are outstanding senior graduate students sent by their respective supervisors, from all across the country, as well as faculty members and research staff from government and industrial labs. These participants hold strong potential to be leaders in the combustion and energy R&D community. Scholarships are available to students enrolled in U.S. academic institutions to cover local expenses. The 2010 and 2011 sessions drew in 122 and 140 participants respectively. Videos of the 2010 lectures by Professor Norbert Peters on Combustion Theory, and by Drs. Stephen J. Klippenstein and Charles K. Westbrook on Combustion Chemistry and 2011 lectures by Professor Moshe Matalon on Combustion Theory, Professor Michael Pilling on Combustion Chemistry, and Professor Marcus Alden on Advanced Laser Diagnostics are available on the Princeton University website. For more information on the Summer School, please visit http://www.princeton.edu/cefrc/combustion-summer-school/ .\r\n \r\nThe 2012 session is scheduled to be held on June 24 to June 29. It is expect this year?s applicants pool to surpass the previous two years, as we have expanded the program provide an even broader variety of topics, something very much sought after, based on feedback from previous year participants. This year, a five-day lecture series is offered on: ?Frontiers of Combustion? covering topics in Policies and Issues in Energy and the Environment, given by Professor Robert H. Socolow; New Developments in Combustion Technology, given by Dr. George A. Richards; Alternative Fuels Including Biofuels, given by Professor William H. Green; Cyber-Combustion, given by Dr. Jacqueline H. Chen; and Nanoengineered Reactive Materials and Their Combustion and Synthesis, given by Professor Richard A. Yetter. In addition to this exciting new offering, the foundation courses of Combustion Theory and Combustion Chemistry are still offered, and will be taught by Professors Heinz G. Pitsch and Hai Wang, respectively. And adding to these foundation courses, Internal Combustion Engines (Gas Turbines and Reciprocating Engines) will be jointly given by Professors Timothy C. Lieuwen and Rolf D. Reitz.",
