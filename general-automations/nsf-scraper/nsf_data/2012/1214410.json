 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative award funds the research activities of Professors V.P. Nair and Alexios Polychronakos at the City College of the City University of New York and Professor Daniel Kabat at Lehman College of the City University of New York.  \r\n\r\nGauge theories describe the interactions of all elementary particles.  One particular gauge theory, known as Quantum Chromodynamics,  describes the interactions of quarks and gluons. These are the  elementary particles inside nuclei, which can bind to form nuclei as well as other yet-to-be-detected particles such as glueballs.  While the interaction of quarks and gluons at very high energies is fairly well understood, a detailed understanding of how quarks and gluons bind together to form nuclei and glueballs, and why isolated quarks cannot exist (\"quark confinement\"), is far from complete.  This research project will contribute in this direction by building on previously introduced techniques within the simpler context of gauge theories with two space dimensions. This research project will also develop new techniques for calculating the Casimir force, which arises from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and which is central to many techniques in nanomechanics.  Finally, on another front, Professors Nair and Polychronakos will continue their work on statistical distributions of random matrices, with implications for a variety of questions from condensed-matter physics to quantum gravity.  New physically observable quantities will be analyzed and their implications for quantum gravity will be explored.\r\n\r\nThis project will have significant broader impacts.  Professors Kabat, Nair, and Polychronakos will involve undergraduate and graduate  students as well as postdoctoral researchers in their work, thereby providing critical training to these junior physicists.  The project  will also play an important role in fostering continuing collaboration between City College and Lehman College.  Maintaining a joint research program has had a positive impact on attracting students to these research areas.  Given the demographics of the two colleges, this has been particularly true for students from minority and under-represented groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGravity is the most familiar force in nature, but at a fundamental level it is also the most mysterious.  We all know that dropped objects will fall towards the earth.  But on a grand scale gravity is the force that shapes the universe as a whole, and on a microscopic level even the most basic properties of gravity are not well understood.\n\nThe research funded by this award seeks to develop a solid mathematical understanding of gravity, using ideas that grew out of string theory.  As a testing ground much of this research focuses on properties of black holes.  Near a black hole gravity reigns supreme and many of its most subtle features become important.  For example we would like to know: does the usual notion of a space-time geometry apply inside a black hole?  Or does it get modified in some way?  If the geometry is modified, are the changes subtle or dramatic?  In a series of related works, the research funded by this award points to an outcome where the modifications are small in practice, but have dramatic consequences as a matter of principle: they violate the notion that no information or influence can be transmitted faster than the speed of light.  This discovery has implications for black holes and may ultimately have repercussions for our understanding of the early universe.\n\nBeyond the fundamental theoretical interest of these results, this award has had significant broader impacts.  A total of three graduate students have been involved in this research during the past year and have received valuable training and experience as a result.  This opportunity has set them on a path toward becoming the next generation of scientists and science educators.  By making it possible to carry out an active program of scientific research at a minority-serving undergraduate institution, this award has helped build an important bridge between the aspirational students at Lehman College and the broader scientific community.  As more students are exposed to current scientific research, this interest in science will continue to grow, and this will lead to positive feedback for many years to come.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Kabat"
