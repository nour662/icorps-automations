 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to examine the functions of the inorganic nanoparticles deposited on the natural fiber surface for the improvement of the interfacial compatibility between the fiber and polymer, and reduction of the manufacture defects for natural fiber-polymer composites.  The research will result in fundamental understanding on the efficiency and roles of impregnated inorganic nanoparticles in the cellulosic fibers on the property enhancement of composites.  Advanced tools and techniques, such as X-ray computer tomography scanning, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and contact angle analysis will be employed to determine the void space and nanoparticle distribution, fiber surface property characterization in terms of the surface energy polar and non-polar components, chemical components, surface morphology and topography, crystalline layer and nucleation study.  Numerical simulations through molecular dynamics (MD) modeling will be conducted to elucidate the functions of the nanoparticles at the interphase of the fibers and polymer matrices.  Deliverables include an optimum process for the inorganic nanoparticle impregnation, property enhancement of the natural fiber nanocomposites, and the mechanism for the improvement of interfacial bonding from the inorganic nanoparticle impregnation process. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will elucidate the functions of nanophase deposited on the fiber surface on the improvement of the interfacial compatibility for the fiber reinforced polymer composites, so that it will provide guidance to optimize processing parameters of using the nanopaticle impregnation technology in the fiber reinforced composites.  Post-doctorate fellows, graduate and undergraduate students will benefit through lab exercise and classroom instruction.\r\n",
