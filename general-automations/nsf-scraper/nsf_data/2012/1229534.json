 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF MRI award funds the acquisition of a hyper-frequency viscoelastic\r\nspectroscopy (HFVS) instrument for materials characterization. It is especially well suited for\r\nmeasuring viscoelastic properties of biological tissues and artificial polymers because it can\r\nmake non-contacting, non-destructive measurements on small-sized samples over a wide\r\nexcitation frequency range. The HFVS instrument will be immediately used in five current\r\nresearch projects: 1) computational simulation of traumatic brain injury; 2) determining the role\r\nof active and passive forces in microvascular network formation; 3) dynamic characterization of\r\nunderactuated legged locomotion, 4) design and fabrication of perching landing gear for microaerial\r\nvehicles, and 5) characterization of a biodegradable, biocompatible co-polymer. The most\r\nsignificant contribution resulting from use of the instrument on each project is: 1) constitutive\r\nmodels for human brain tissue at high strain rates appropriate for blast-response simulation and\r\nanalysis; 2) characterization of a new extra-cellular matrix biomimetics for studying the effects\r\nof both active and passive mechanical environments on cells, 3) material-tunable, dynamic\r\nmodels of underactuated legged locomotion for milli-scale robots, 4) tunable-stiffness and ?\r\ndamping, polymer fabrication processes for perching landing gear mechanisms, and 5)\r\nmanufacturing processes for controlling the properties of a class of environmentally-friendly, copolymers\r\nfor medical applications. In addition to supporting ongoing research, the instrument\r\nwill enable future research involving related materials and will open new research areas in\r\nbioengineering, material science, and mechanical engineering\r\n\r\nThe HFVS instrument will substantially enhance metrology capabilities at Olin College enabling\r\nthe characterization of materials ranging in stiffness from very compliant, nearly liquid (e.g.,\r\ngels) to very rigid by quantitative measurement of mechanical stiffness and energy dissipation\r\nrelated properties. The characterization of materials plays an integral part in a wide range of\r\nresearch problems especially those including computer simulations and the custom design and\r\nmanufacturing of components or structures involving the given materials. The acquisition of a\r\nHFVS instrument will have significant positive impact on Olin College?s research capability,\r\nundergraduate research training efforts, and curriculum. The instrument will directly support the\r\ntraining and education of undergraduates at Olin College where approximately 45% of students\r\nand 55% of the bioengineering, material science, and mechanical engineering majors are women.\r\nResearch training is incorporated throughout the curriculum directly into project-based and\r\nlaboratory-based coursework. Students have numerous individual research opportunities to work\r\nwith faculty during the academic year and in the summer. The instrument will be specifically\r\nutilized in a number of courses and will be particularly useful in the senior-year, engineering\r\ncapstone course in which student teams tackle industry-sponsored projects.",
