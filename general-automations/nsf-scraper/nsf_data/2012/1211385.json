 "awd_abstract_narration": "A great mystery of the Universe is how the first stars and galaxies formed.  Astrophysicists can virtually look back in time by examining some of the most distant galaxies in the Universe, whose light has taken billions of years to reach Earth.  Detailed, careful study of these very distant galaxies is critical to understanding how the first stars and galaxies formed.  Unfortunately, it is very challenging to identify these galaxies.  This project aims to use a new technique that exploits gravitational lensing by foreground clusters of galaxies that magnify these distant galaxies, making them easier to detect.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigators' (PIs') new theoretical framework for analyzing multiple-lensing planes reveals that there are mass distributions consisting of multiple structures along the line-of-sight and large integrated masses that produce a many-fold increase in the number of lensed z > ~7 sources, particularly at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function.  These beams are effective because they create significant magnification over a large area, or high etendue.  Cosmological simulations suggest that they are rare but identifiable by choosing lines-of-sight with the highest integrated luminosities of galaxies that trace the densest structures, i.e., luminous red galaxies.  The PIs have now identified 40 such lines-of-sight in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).  Spectroscopy of the first seven confirms that they are likely the most powerful gravitational lens telescopes in the sky.  This project will use a comprehensive observational and theoretical program to enable highly efficient ground- and space-based follow-up surveys for lensed z ~ 7 to 10 sources.  Using galaxy spectroscopy and lensed arc imaging to constrain each line-of-sight mass distribution, coupled with theoretical modeling to generate a precise lensing magnification map, the PIs will place the first limits on the faint end luminosity evolution of the most distant galaxies.\r\n\r\nThis work will advance the training of graduate students at The University of Arizona and Rutgers University by allowing them to work with senior personnel on forefront observational analyses and theoretical modeling.  Co-PI Zabludoff is involved in The University of Arizona's Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) chapter, where she discusses her research in their workshops for teenage girls.  She will also talk about astronomy research and careers with members of the Tohono O'odham Nation and with students in local schools.  Co-PI Keeton is the Faculty Director of the Aresty Research Center for Undergraduates at Rutgers, a privately-endowed center that supports approximately 200 student research projects each year.  This project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education via the co-PI's partnership, advance the teaching of faculty and the training and learning of students, broaden the dissemination of knowledge through the public release of the lens modeling software, and may increase the participation of underrepresented women and Native Americans through outreach.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit.  Through gravitational lensing, clusters of galaxies act as \"cosmic telescopes\" to make distant galaxies appear bigger and brighter, and therefore easier to study.  The goal of this project was to identify the types of cluster fields that have the most lensing power, and to understand how their mass distributions affect their ability to bend light.  We used cosmological simulations to argue that the best lensing fields often contain multiple groups or clusters of galaxies; the combined light bending effects can be stronger than if all the mass were in a single cluster.  We developed a new way to find cluster lensing fields, by searching the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for collections of red galaxies that trace massive structures.  We introduced methods for gravitational lens modeling that account for the full three-dimensional mass distribution along the line of sight, and obtained observational data to constrain the 3-d mass models.  We also implemented modeling methods that make use of the full pixel information from lensed arcs.  Together, these advances allowed us to build the first three-dimensional lens models for cluster lensing fields, with special emphasis on a field called J085007.6+360428.  This field contains one particularly massive galaxy cluster, a galaxy group in the foreground, and other galaxies along the line of sight.  We identified two lensed images of a galaxy that is seen a little over a billion years after the big bang.  Based on our lens models, we predict that one of the images is magnified by a factor greater than 100, and parts of it are magnified by as much as 1000 times.  Such a lensing configuration provides an opportunity to examine a distant galaxy with much higher resolution than would be possible without gravitational lensing.\n\nBroader impacts.  This project provided training in astrophysics research for three graduate students and five undergraduate students, including five from groups that are currently underrepresented in science (three women, one African-American, and one Latino).  PI Keeton supported undergraduate research more broadly by serving as Faculty Director of the Aresty Research Center for Undergraduates at Rutgers University, which helps hundreds of students join faculty research projects each year.  He also used outreach presentations and a book to help non-experts understand how astronomers ask and answer questions about the universe.  The book, called \"A Ray of Light in a Sea of Dark Matter\" (Rutgers University Press) strives not only to report results from research but also to convey the critical thinking skills that astronomers use to investigate cosmic phenomena to which we have no direct access.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles R Keeton"
