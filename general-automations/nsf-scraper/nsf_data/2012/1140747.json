The organizers expect about 20-25 participants from USA, out of the anticipated total number of 80-110 participants. This proposal seeks funds to provide partial support for 15-20 US participants, with priority given to graduate students, junior researchers, and, once the needs of those groups are met, to other US participants without sufficient sources of support.",
