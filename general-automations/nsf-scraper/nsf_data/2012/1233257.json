 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many empirical studies of hydrothermal vent systems on the seafloor and an increasing number of biogeochemical studies are being carried out to look at various mineralogical and biological processes using unconventional stable isotopes (i.e., those of heavy elements such as iron, zinc, copper, and sulfur). To allow quantitative and predictive results of these empirical studies, fractionation factors of these isotopes must be known.  However, at present, no experimental work to derive these coefficients and parameters have been carried out.  This research builds off a one-year proof-of-concept study to show that fractionation occurs in these systems in a systematic way. The new project examines the effects of temperature, fluid chemistry, and reaction rate on the fractionation of non-traditional stable isotopes (Fe, Cu, Zn, S) between sulfide minerals and fluids at elevated temperatures and pressures. The work will include phase separation experiments to assess the role of fluid chemistry on non-traditional stable isotope fractionation between vapor and brine. It will use isotope tracers in equilibrium experiments to look at reaction progress and to see how isotope systematics respond to reaction rates and mechanisms. Sulfur isotope exchange for homogeneous and heterogeneous systems will also be tested experimentally. Broader impacts of the work include building fundamental infrastructure for science via the development of kinetic and fractionation factors that are essential for the development of theoretical models for predicting stabilities of minerals containing Fe, Cu, Zn, and S. Impacts also include the engagement of graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art experimental studies of water-rock interaction and the involvement of an early career PI from an institution in an EPSCOR State (Louisiana).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPyrite is ubiquitous in both marine and terrestrial hydrothermal systems as well as low temperature marine sedimentary environments.  The mechanisms and pathway of pyrite precipitation, however, have been debated extensively.  Although stable sulfur isotope systematics would shed light on the process, the equilibrium fractionation factor between aqueous sulfur species and pyrite was not well constrained.  Experimental determination isotope equilibrium fractionation factor is often difficult due to sluggish isotope exchange kinetics between pyrite and aqueous sulfur species. \n\nWe have carried out a series of experiments to determine equilibrium multiple sulfur isotope fractionation factors (33S/32S and 34S/32S) between aqueous SO4, H2S, and coexisting pyrite under hydrothermal conditions at 300&ndash;350 &deg;C and 500 bars.  The use of flexible gold cell hydrothermal equipment allowed monitoring the multiple S isotope composition of dissolved S species during pyrite precipitation and subsequent recrystallization.  Multiple sulfur isotope ratios were measured for experimental products using fluorination technique.\n\nThe three isotope technique was applied to the multiple S isotope data to demonstrate equilibrium S isotope fractionation between pyrite and H2S. Results indicate fractionation factor of -1.9 and -1.0 &permil; for 300 and 350&deg;C, respectively (pyrite is depleted in 34S).  The derived fractionation factor is not only different in magnitude but also in sign from the commonly used value of +1.0&permil; suggested by Ohmoto and Rye (1979).\n\nWe also tested the potential role of pyrite in catalyzing or inhibiting isotope exchange amongst aqueous S-species during precipitation and recrystallization.  Unexpectedly, we found pyrite apparently slowed down the isotope exchange between aqueous sulfate and sulfide, but we also found that isotope exchange between pyrite and hydrogen sulfide is not too slow to be observed experimentally (experiments over 180 days show 95% isotope exchange). Our experimental study also demonstrated initial S isotope disequilibrium amongst the aqueous S-species and pyrite during rapid precipitation, despite aqueous speciation indicating pyrite saturation at all stages.\n\nInterpretation of seafloor hydrothermal vent sulfides using the revised equilibrium 34S/32S fractionation between pyrite and H2S suggests that pyrite is close to S isotope equilibrium with vent H2S, contrary to previous conclusions. The data we obtained provide 1) a fundamental constraint on the pathways of pyrite formation in hydrothermal environment as well as calibrating isotope effect estimated by spectroscopic techniques.
