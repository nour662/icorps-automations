 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an exploratory EAGER research project that will provide the CoPI with a two-week visit to two sites in Greenland, Nuuk and Kulusuk, in order to lay the foundation for extended field research that will explore Greenland's independence movement through its nation-building efforts, particularly its nation-branding campaign, \"Branding Greenland.\" \r\n\r\nExploratory work will consist of one-week in each location during which contact with local officials and community members will be initiated.  Efforts will focus on explaining the proposed research and receiving local feedback which will be incorporated into the long-term research design.  In Nuuk, discussion of long-term research will be initiated with governmental officials, members of the Branding Greenland initiative, political parties, and local groups.  In Kulusuk, consultation will be initiated with community officials and leaders about the proposed research and community approval for this work.  This preliminary visit will also introduce the CoPI to the issues surrounding independence, nationalism, and nation-branding as they appear on the ground in Greenland.  Together these preliminary efforts will provide the foundation for a comprehensive long-term research plan that will examine Branding Greenland as a vehicle through which national culture and identity are constructed and broadcast, particularly through policy initiatives, economic ventures, and media venues, and their exhibition and experience in everyday life.\r\n\r\nThis EAGER research provides the basis for long-term work that examines the increasing role of culture and identity as tools for economic development and political recognition by indigenous and minority groups, through an examination of Greenlands nation branding efforts.   As was recognized by the ASSP panel and the Program, the proposed DIG project is not possible without the prior insights and approval of Greenlanders which will be achieved through this exploratory EAGER research.  A key goal of this EAGER research is to incorporate the perspectives and interests of the people of Greenland into the long-term research design. Connections with various governmental and non-governmental groups will be established and avenues through which this research can be made relevant to both academic audiences and indigenous communities will be explored.",
