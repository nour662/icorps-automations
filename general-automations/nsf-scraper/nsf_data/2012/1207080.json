They are used for the detection and measurement of radiation in fields like security, energy, medical diagnosis, and science.  Presently, there is a knowledge gap relating the fabrication and processing conditions of transparent ceramic scintillators with their scintillation output, a situation that undermines their performance and negatively impacts the widespread use of these materials.  The innovative aspect of this project is to go beyond the fabrication of transparent ceramics to establish relations between fabrication conditions, microstructure, and defect characteristics with afterglow and scintillation performance.  The broader impacts include the engagement of students in research activities, scientific events, and teaching; concomitant to broadening the participation of faculty from underrepresented Latino minority in institutions from the EPSCoR states SC and OK; and the dissemination of results.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: It is hypothesized that the intensities of scintillation and afterglow are related to the concentration of structural imperfections that generate electronic traps, and that it is possible to mitigate afterglow by identifying suitable rare earth dopants to drain charge carriers off traps. The project aims at investigating the effect of grain boundary density and oxygen non-stoichiometry on the scintillation efficiency and afterglow intensity and duration, and at developing a predictive capability to identify suitable rare earth dopants to decrease afterglow intensity and duration. It focuses on rare earth doped Lu2O3, Y2O3, and Y3Al5O12 transparent ceramics, ultimately generating an understanding about how to fabricate ceramic scintillators with enhanced performance that can benefit the strategic areas and society in general.",
