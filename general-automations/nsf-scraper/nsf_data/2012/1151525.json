 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction\r\nThe notion of a signal plays a very important role in contemporary biology. From cell signaling to environmental signals as external determinants of gene expression, signals are conceptual cornerstones to models of life. In the lab, they are experimentally manipulated and pharmaceutically targeted objects. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nUnlike the gene, the signal has received little attention in the science and technology studies literature. This research project examines how signals came into life science, with a focus on metabolic hormone biology after 1950. The book that will eventually result from this research will elaborate the history of the discoveries of hormonal mechanisms; it will, at the same time, serve as an unprecedented theoretical resource for understanding where the biological notion of a signal comes from and what shapes its uses today in biology and society. Much is known about the history of the idea of DNA as information. The history of the signal however, is an underexplored story of cybernetics and engineering practices of control and communication on biology, a history that unfolds in the realms of steroid biochemistry, metabolic regulation, insect chemical communication, and work not at the cell?s nucleus but at its membranes. Related scholarship has focused on pre-1950 endocrinology and sex hormones; by contrast, this work will provide a compelling narrative of how hormones went molecular, explaining how the very category of hormone begins to fray as it is subsumed under the signal along with neurotransmitters, cytokines, and growth factors.\r\n\r\nPotential Broader Impacts\r\nAs life science turns increasingly toward fathoming protein-protein interactions, gene regulation, and the regulatory role of the cellular and external environment, this history becomes increasingly timely. Signals are constitutive to biological life and thought, and have profound impact on society in terms of models of the body and health, understandings of gene-environment interaction, and the consequent biotechnical outcomes of intervening in signaling cascades.  An accessible history and theory of the signal will benefit readers in life sciences, history, philosophy and sociology of science, and a broader educated audience.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA key concept in contemporary life sciences is that of the signal.  Cells, from microbes to human cells, are understood to communicate with one another via a variety of signaling molecules.   Environmental signals such as nutrients are transduced into the organism and enable adaptation or anticipation of future conditions.  Ever-more kinds of molecules, from the more traditional hormones to the much newer micro RNAs are understood to perform a signaling and communication function in and between cells and tissues.  Signal transduction molecules such as G Protein Linked Receptors form a signicant target for pharmaceutical therapies, and are important in cancer biology.  Yet the theory and concept of signals is very understudied in the sociology, history and philosophy of science, in contrast the the idea of the gene or the molecule.  This points to the significance of understanding how and why the life and biomedical sciences came to think and work in terms of signals, and the implications of a signaling framework for technical applications of this knowledge.   Scientists, social scientists, and publics will gain insight into the explanatory role of the signal in understanding and researching how environments and bodies interact, how different kinds of cells live together in ecologies, and how drugs work.\n\nThe purpose of this study has been to uncover the history of the signal concept in the life science.  Because this is a large question, it was pursued in the specific context of metabolic hormone research after 1950.  While the history of hormone research has received attention from historians of biology and medicine, most of this attention has been directed at sex hormones, and part of the intellectual merit of this research has been to add to our stock of knowledge about the history of metabolic hormones.  Endocrinology was one place where hormones came to be understood in the language of digital signal processing, in an explicit uptake of concepts into hormone biology from cybernetics. \n\nWhile the concept of the hormone was since its inception in the early 1900s  couched in terms of hormones as \"chemical messengers,\" the transition from messenger to signal was a significant one.  Archival and interview work undertaken with this grant has shown how endocrinologists and biochemists began to think about hormones as signals, receptors as transducers, and cell signaling cascades inside the cell as amplifiers during the 1960s.  In so doing, the theoretical framework of hormone biology transitioned from a thermodynamic model to one based on the transmission of information through the transduction of signals.  Transduction means the conversion of a signal from one medium to another, and it provided a framework for understanding how and why a hormone might not have to be physically present and exert an energetic or chemical effect on its ultimate target, but a cascade of intermediate molecules might carry the effect.  Importantly, while this history unfolds alongside and in conversation with research on DNA and the genetic code, it provides a different view into the impact that concepts of information and communication had on biology than the more well-known story of the genetic code. \n\nFindings from this research have been disseminated through domestic and international conference presentations and research colloquia in the settings of the history and philsophy of science, science and technology studies, and to audiences of life scientists and biomedical researchers.  It has seen pedagogical dissemination through incorporation into the Human Biology and Society curriculum at UCLA.  The grant has also resulted in several journal publications and supported the drafting of chapters of a book on the topic.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/27/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hannah L Landecker"
