 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project entitled - Computational Thinking as an Approach to Refining the Critical Thinking and Analytical Reasoning Skills of Undergraduates at an HBCU - has the goal to expand on a new course in Computational Thinking to ensure that students who complete this course have enhanced critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills. The objectives of this project are: to identify and develop exact measures of Computational Thinking competencies; to develop a curriculum that successfully integrates critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills with Computational Thinking skills; and to determine whether Computational Thinking competencies enhance critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills for students at Jackson State University.\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to the newly evolving area of Computational Thinking. Advocates of computational thinking believe that it will transform not only Computer Science education, but K-16 education in general.  Ninety-Two percent of the students enrolled at Jackson State University are African-American. As part of the institution's core curriculum all students must take a computing course. Therefore, this project has the potential to impart Computational Thinking, critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills to a large number of underrepresented students. This project will ensure that HBCUs and other minority serving institutions are a part of the evolving Computational Thinking community. Course modules and a theoretical framework resulting from this project will be disseminated through traditional means such as publications and presentations as well as various computing related pathways.",
