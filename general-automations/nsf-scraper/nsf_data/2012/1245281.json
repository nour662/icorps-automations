The planned mini-courses and talks will cover various aspect of geometric group theory such as CAT(0)-cube complexes, quasi-isometric rigidity, automorphisms of free groups and systolic complexes, and make connections with other fields of mathematics including representation theory, geometric measure theory, ergodic theory, differential geometry and model theory.\r\n\r\nGeometric group theory is a fairly young and dynamic field studied by an international community of researchers. Most of the workshop attendees will be early-career mathematicians; the schedule is designed to maximize the interactions among young researchers, as well as to give them extended contact with leading experts in the field. A website for the conference is at http://www.math.technion.ac.il/cms/decade_2011-2020/year_2012-2013/.",
