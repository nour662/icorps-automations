 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although most plants are essentially stuck in one place for most of their life cycle, they are able to move to new and sometimes distant locations as seeds.  Understanding how seeds move or \"disperse\", is important for determining a plant species' ability to traverse increased distances to find suitable habitats as those habitats change naturally or through the actions of humans.  The availability of nutrients might strongly affect the number of seeds a plant can produce, the quality of those seeds, and how far they can disperse.  To understand how changes in nutrients might influence seed dispersal, tallgrass prairie seeds will be collected along a north-south gradient from Texas to Minnesota from plots to which nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium have been added.   Dispersal patterns are difficult to understand because most prairie seeds are too small for traditional tracking devices.  To combat this difficulty an alternative approach will be used: the \"flight\" of seeds will be studied in wind tunnels, using aerodynamic engineering technology to determine the distances seeds can travel.   These distances will be used to make predictions about the ability of different plant species to move between disparate habitats.\r\n\r\nThis project will immerse undergraduate students in both the Engineering and the Biology Departments at Iowa State University (ISU) in research that integrates biology, mathematics, engineering and technology.  This unique approach will allow for broader thinking of young scientists.  In addition, the cross-departmental nature of this project will give students and faculty the chance to expand the current scope of their research studying seed dispersal from many angles.  Results from this research will be incorporated into ISU curriculum through undergraduate seminars developed by graduate students.  The importance of integrating engineering, math and technology into the biological sciences will also be presented through various interactive activities to elementary and middle school students through local programs that encourage exploration of science at a young age.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMy doctoral dissertation improvement grant allowed me to perform novel interdisciplinary research, and advance the fields of ecology and aerospace engineering in relation to the aerodynamics of grassland plant dispersal.  This work gave me the opportunity to develop excellent collaboration skills with scientists both within and outside my discipline, and inspired an interest in continuing to work on interdisciplinary research questions.  With this grant, I asked two distinct research questions: 1) How do nutrient additions (e.g.: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)) influence the potential dispersal of grassland plant species, and 2) How do ecological traits related to seed dispersal like morphology and mass influence the flight ability, or aerodynamics of seeds from these grassland plants.\n\n \n\n1) Effects of nutrient additions on grassland plant dispersal\n\nTo answer the first question, I sampled plots with all combinations of nutrient addition (N, P, K, NP, NK, PK, and NPK) in grasslands from three states.  This work took place through the Nutrient Network (NutNet), a globally replicated experiment to understand how nutrient additions influence grasslands world-wide.  Most NutNet research relates to how nutrient additions influence diversity and productivity.  Work through this grant allowed me to increase the scope of the NutNet by understanding how nutrient additions also influence dispersal, which is an important aspect of plant movement.  I found that nutrient additions (specifically the addition of N) had a strong impact on the dispersal traits of grassland plant communities.  Plant height, an important determinant of dispersal distance, was strongly influenced by the addition of N (Figure 1).  Plants that tended to be dominant in their respective communities increased seed release height under all treatments with N added, whereas non-dominant plants decreased in height.  Seed mass is another important trait for dispersal, as heavier seeds tend to travel less distance.  Nutrient additions did not change seed mass (Figure 2).  When the values for these traits were used to model the potential dispersal distance each plant species could travel, I showed that plots with nutrient additions had the ability to increase the dispersal distance much farther than in plots without nutrient additions.\n\n \n\n2) Aerodynamics of grassland seeds\n\nTo answer my second question, I collaborated with scientists in the Aerospace Engineering department.  Together we built a vertical wind tunnel (Figure 3) where we calculated the kinematics (i.e.: seed motion in flight), and the aerodynamics (i.e.: how air moves around seeds that influence their flight patterns) of common grassland seeds.  We found that the kinematics of seeds with and without plumes, (i.e.: a dandelion seed vs a sunflower seed, respectively) were very different, and this difference altered how the seed moved during flight.  Seeds with plumes tended to float straight up and down, or would drift to one side if the weight was unbalanced.  Seeds without plumes rotated and tumbled in many directions.  Seed aerodynamics was also very different between seeds with and without plumes.  Seeds without plumes tended to shed vortices (i.e.: air currents) in a broken pattern with lots of alternating spin (Figure 4a), whereas seeds with plumes shed extremely straight vortices (Figure 4b).  These vortex-shedding patterns can provide insight into the mechanics behind how far seeds can travel.\n\n \n\nWork from this grant had many broader impacts for both my career, for others in the scientific community, and for citizens outside of the scientific community.  Through this grant, I was able to receive interdisciplinary training as a graduate student, which is a rare opportunity.  I was also able to fund a female postdoc to also work on in interdisciplinary engineering/ecology work.  Together, we constructed a vertical wind tunnel, which is new infrastructure at Iowa State.  This tunnel will..."
