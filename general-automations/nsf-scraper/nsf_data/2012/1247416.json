 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is a travel grant to fund underrepresented groups to attend the 2012 Software Engineering Educators Symposium (SEES12) and the 2012 ACM SIGSOFT Conference on Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE12). This proposal aims to help address problems of the low representation of women and minorities in computer science graduate degree programs in the United States. It will supply travel awards to educators from minority-serving institutions (MSIs), liberal arts colleges, and primarily teaching universities to attend the 2012 Software Engineering Educators? Symposium (SEES12) and the 2012 ACM SIGSOFT Conference on Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE12). SEES12 aims to (1) expose educators to tools and techniques for teaching software engineering and programming that they can use to interest their students and better prepare them for graduate work in SE; and (2) establish connections between educators at PhD granting research universities and those at target institutions that will serve as avenues for recruitment of underrepresented minorities and women.",
