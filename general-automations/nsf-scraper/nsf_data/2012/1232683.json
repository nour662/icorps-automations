 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is to develop experimentally validated physics-based models of the mechanical material removal processes in biological tissue machining. The approach is to characterize unique aspects of biological tissue machining in four related research activities. 1) Describe the transition from material deformation and plowing to material removal. The specific objective is to develop machining test systems and material removal models for the new classes of work materials being studied. 2) Develop and validate machining force and debris size models. The specific objective is to predict machined surface and subsurface damage that is directly related to medical treatment success. 3) Create artery deformation models that are directly linked to material removal models. The specific goal is to infer short- and long-term effects in the project application process of atherectomy, the removal of plaque from blood vessels. 4) Characterize the dynamic behaviour and effects of long, flexible tool drive systems on tool-work interactions. The specific objective is to provide realistic medical procedure inputs to machining process and work damage models. \r\n\r\nIf successful, fundamental machining studies and research results will be widely useful in many tissue machining processes. The benefits of this research will be improved performance of commonly used medical devices, new machining test systems, and new tissue machining models that include work material deformation models directly related to possible machining damage and surgical treatment success. The project will extend the integrated activity of manufacturing engineering, biomedical engineering and health care by immediately bringing together practicing professionals in engineering, medicine and medical device design who have committed to actively participate in the research. These individuals will bring with them graduate and undergraduate students and working technicians from these fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSafe Removal of the Hardened Plaque in Artery \n\nAtherectomy is a catheter-based interventional procedure to remove the hardened plaque from the arterial wall to restore the blood flow.  The atherectomy device, as shown in Fig. 1, consists of a burr with diamond abrasive, a guidewire, a drive shaft and a tube.  The guidewire and tube are not rotating.  The burr is driven by the driveshaft and rotates very fast, up to 230,000 revolutions per minute (rpm), inside the artery to grind the plaque into very small debris.  The burr also moves along the guidewire and is driven by an air turbine motor.  Saline fluid flows inside the tube to lubricate and cool the drive shaft.  Blood flows outside the tube. \n\nThis project studies how the plaque was removed by atherectomy.  We observed that the rotating burr orbited around the inside of the artery, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a).  This orbital motion allows a small burr to remove plaque in a large vessel.  The burr orbits because of the surrounding fluid flow.  A 3D computational fluid dynamics model (Fig. 2(b)) was developed to calculate the fluid flow around the burr.  We measured the force applied on the artery during atherectomy.  The faster the burr rotates, the high the force was. We found the debris size from this procedure is smaller when the wheel rotates faster.  To predict the force and debris size, we have created a computer simulation, as shown in Fig. 3, based on a method called smoothed particle hydrodynamics.  We also learned that it was the long drive shaft friction that generated the most heat during atherectomy procedure.  Reducing the rotational speed and increasing the saline flow can avoid temperature going too high for the vessel.\n\nOur findings can help intervention cardiology physicians to perform atherectomy using a smaller burr to avoid hurting the artery with too high a force or temperature or blocking small vessels with debris.  We are working with companies making this atherectomy device improve their products\n\nThis Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award.
