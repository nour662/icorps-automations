 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project utilizes recent technological advances to develop, implement, and evaluate the use of virtual and physical 3-D models of soil and organism-formed structures in the undergraduate geoscience curriculum. Multi-stripe laser triangulation scanning is transforming physical specimens into digitized virtual models that students can manipulate and measure using readily available software. The resulting digital collection is being made broadly available via dissemination through web portals utilized by geoscience educators. In addition, rapid prototyping technology (3-D printing) is creating light and durable plastic models for direct manipulation of selected specimens, including rare and/or fragile examples.\r\n\r\nLearning impacts of using the virtual and physical models, both separately and together, are being evaluated in multiple laboratory sections of introductory geoscience courses at the University of Kansas. Results are providing insights into effective strategies for enhancing 3D visualization and conceptual understanding of features and processes in soils. These insights and the technological approaches are being shared with the community of undergraduate geoscience educators, stimulating adaptation and broader applications elsewhere.",

Many undergraduate students enrolled in geoscience courses have difficulty visualizing important three-dimensional (3-D) components of the terrestrial environment such as soils and biogenic structures (e.g., traces of burrows, nests, and roots).

Thus, problems visualizing 3-D structures are likely to lead to problems understanding Earth surface and subsurface processes and in reconstructing past environments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project, we created a digital library of existing soil and biogenic structures. Soil structures included soil monoliths (large thick impregnated soil thick sections that retain the natural layering, color, and structure of soil in the field) and common individual ped (visible aggregates with repeating shapes or sizes) types (e.g., angular blocky, granular, platy, or prismatic structures). Biogenic structures included modern and fossilized tracks, coprolites (dung), nests, roots, burrows, and cells; these structures represented the presence or past presence of plants, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. These structures were scanned using MLT and fabricated with a 3-D printer to compare the effectiveness of using digital specimens with physical 3-D printed specimens. In addition, a Java-based software (OBJ Viewer) was created in this project to allow users to measure angles and distances, set scales, view multiple files while constraining all the files to the same scale, zoom multiple files simultaneously, toggle the texture map, and view either faces, lines, or points, among other features. This software was designed specifically to mimic the feel of working with physical specimens.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the digital library and software, corresponding instructional material, laboratory exercises, assessments, and rubrics were also developed in this project for use in geoscience undergraduate courses.
