 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two important challenges in the control of quantum devices will be addressed in this project.  The first involves the cooling and control of nano-mechanical resonators. A method will be developed that exploits quantum error-correction to increase the accuracy of control via superconducting circuits. The second challenge is designing fast and efficient implementations for complex quantum circuits for control and computation. Various approaches aimed at reducing the computing power needed to optimize such circuits will be investigated.\r\n\r\nAs part of the project, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in high-performance computing. Student access to parallel computing will be supported and strengthened at Williams College and the University of Massachusetts at Boston (UMB). The project will further develop a research and mentoring collaboration between Williams College, an outstanding undergraduate institution, and UMB, a public urban graduate institution.",
