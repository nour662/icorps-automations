 "awd_abstract_narration": "Craven Community College's S-STEM project [Scholars in Engineering and Science (SEAS)] is awarding 16 one-year scholarships each year for five years to financially needy, underrepresented students who demonstrate academic promise and are interested in pursuing a STEM career. With sustained high academic performance, students are eligible for a second year of SEAS scholarship support. The SEAS program combines a rigorous classroom curriculum, a vibrant student learning community, and readily utilized student support services to improve student engagement, learning, persistence and opportunity for degree completion. Scholarship recipients are participating in a weekly seminar course each semester to facilitate cohort unity while also building a strong social support system, and scholars are provided with information on STEM research initiatives and careers through invited speaker presentations and career-related topics and discussions. \r\n\r\nSEAS program participants are engaged in the Engineering and Science Connections Mentor Program, and they are paired with a local mentor in their chosen field of study. Students in the second year of their program are given the opportunity to apply for an $800 enhancement grant to support independent research projects and to lend support to them if attending a state or regional scientific conference. In order to promote a seamless transfer of STEM students from the community college to a four-year institution, Craven CC continues to pursue additional articulation and bi-lateral agreements with transfer institutions for STEM programs. The SEAS program is clearly impacting STEM education at Craven CC, while it also serves as a prototype to other programs nationally.",

Two hundred and forty-five full and partial scholarships were awarded to scholars during this time period, allowing students to pursue a variety of STEM degrees and careers. Fifty-seven scholars completed the program to graduate and/or transfer, with 83% currently pursuing a STEM degree or working in a STEM field. Figure 1 shows the number of students admitted to SEAS for the years 2012-2023 and the students who graduated during this time. While only 70.4% of the SEAS scholars graduated/transferred, those students who did not complete the program received academic and career counseling and many transferred into other programs, such AAS or AA. College leadership and science faculty were delighted at the positive outcomes achieved by program participants.</p>\n<p>Broader impacts of the program include the mentorship and encouragement provided to students, the exposure to baccalaureate programs and senior institutions, and the connections made between SEAS scholars and STEM professionals. SEAS scholars visited North Carolina universities to expose scholars to specific transfer processes, degree programs, and the university environment. Normally three universities were visited each year, allowing students to choose which to visit. During the 10.5 years of the grant, SEAS scholars regularly toured NCSU, ECU, UNC-Chapel Hill, and UNC-Wilmington. Figures 2 and 3 show scholars visiting NCSU and ECU, respectively. On many of the campus visits, scholars were able to meet with a former SEAS scholar to discuss their experience of transferring from Craven CC to a university and what their day-to-day university educational experience entails. The visits and interactions with a former Craven CC SEAS scholar provided in-depth exposure into the transfer process, transition to university life, and university course workload, thereby encouraging scholars to make informed decisions about their choice of university.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The SEAS Program also offered the opportunity for scholars to experience STEM in a fun, stress-free, and educational manner by visiting educational events and places of learning (see Figure 4). The campus tours and subsequent interactions, as well as visits to places of learning, often were highlights of the program, encouraging students and helping to provide them with the confidence needed to transfer to a university and pursue a baccalaureate degree and a STEM career. The scholars, also, participated in a seminar series and mentoring program that allowed them to meet and interact with STEM professionals from different backgrounds, life experiences, and areas of STEM and experience STEM concepts in an exciting \"out of the box\" fashion. Figure 5 shows scholars participating in a chemistry experiment involving iron shavings, glow sticks, and magnets. During seminars, they learned about the educational experience and what a \"day in the life\" would be like for the STEM professionals and earned a professional contact that could assist in their pursuit of a STEM degree and career. By getting the scholars out of the classroom, these educational experiences impacted the students by showing them that transferring to a university is not as daunting as they thought, they have support during the process, STEM is fun and exciting, and there are interesting career paths associated with STEM degrees.</p>\n<p>Society is constantly advancing which means that more STEM students and thus STEM professionals are needed. Many students leave STEM programs due to varying reasons, which leads to insufficient STEM graduates to fill the available STEM jobs. This program provided the knowledge, exposure, and guidance to promote STEM in a way to improve retention of STEM students and subsequent STEM professionals. This is shown with early cohorts of SEAS scholars that have graduated from 4-year universities with a degree in STEM and are currently working in a STEM field. As SEAS scholars advance in their careers, there will be the opportunity to contribute to intellectual merit within their field by contributing to the STEM workforce in areas such as mechanical engineering, medicine, civil engineering, mathematics education, computer programming and design, and environmental science to name a few. More recent cohorts are in the process of contributing to intellectual merit by working on obtaining their undergraduate and/or graduate degree in areas of STEM that include electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, computer engineering, medicine, biological sciences, and environmental science and safety. Throughout the course of the SEAS Program, scholars have, also, had the opportunity to promote STEM and advance their own education and careers with ~15% participating in undergraduate research, 3 scholars being awarded the North Carolina Community College System (NCCCS) Academic Award, 1 scholar being awarded the NCCCS Leadership Award, and 2 scholars being awarded the NCSU Goodnight
