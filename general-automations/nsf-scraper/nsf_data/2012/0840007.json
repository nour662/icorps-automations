 "awd_abstract_narration": "Greenberg intends to photograph the IceCube Neutrino Observatory as part of a larger project about high energy physics, supported by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. For this project he already has  photographed at CERN in Switzerland, DESY in Germany, Triumf in Canada, and Fermilab, Brookhaven, Stanford and LIGO in the United States. \r\nHe also has worked in Japan and the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina. \r\n Greenberg?s earlier projects?which reached a large segment of the population through books, exhibitions, radio and television?opened up a door to places normally inaccessible to the public at large. As with his earlier projects, about urban infrastructure and construction of contemporary architecture, Greenberg hopes to introduce readers and viewers to something essential, but taken for granted. This particular project is about how the universe works, or at the very least, about how scientists try to find out about the universe.  It is also about how science is done, and how cooperative a venture it has become. \r\n Although Greenberg?s work does not usually portray people, the text in the book and exhibition will fully describe the workings of each experiment and include some writing about the community of physicists. \r\nGreenberg also intends to include images of the South Pole Telescope in this portfolio.",
