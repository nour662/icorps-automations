 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative Rapid Response Research (RAPID) Grant provides funding to collect field data about damage by Hurricane Isaac to transmission lines, distribution lines and electrical substations. The power loss resulting from this hurricane affected more than one million households and businesses, and the restoration for over 250,000 customers took more than 72 hours. The specific reasons for these power outages are not known, though it is reported that more than 40 substations were damaged either by wind or flood. It is important to collect the data about damages to transmission and distribution lines quickly, and to determine whether the cause of the damage was by wind or by flood.\r\n\r\nThe data that will be collected under this award will be archived on the web site of the American Association for Wind Engineering enabling access to other researchers.  These data will also be archived by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.",
