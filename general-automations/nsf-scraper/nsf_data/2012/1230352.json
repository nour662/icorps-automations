 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop the next-generation DNA test kits for forensic DNA testing. DNA profiling has developed significantly over the past 20 years and is routinely used to solve crime. Despite improvements in DNA testing technologies and equipment, a significant number of  investigative biological samples do not yield informative results, due to excessive degradation of DNA.  A significant number of crime scene and mass disaster samples are still unable to produce useful profiles due to current technology limitations. This research project utilizes a proprietary primer design approach in to analyze a significant number of degraded DNA samples. This project will also contribute to a basic understanding of human populations and their ancestral origins.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this proposed project, if successful, will allow society to obtain answers to identification questions that could not previously be obtained, due to the limitations of current technology. Some of the benefits that can be expected from the development of this technology include:  Solving more crimes using next generation DNA tests, including cases that were previously not testable, due to excessively degraded samples; assisting in the resolution of missing persons cases; provide closure to families of mass disaster victims such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Hurricane Katrina as well as identifying human remains of soldiers who lost their lives on foreign soil; provide ancestral origin information for individuals seeking information regarding their genealogy; provide a powerful intelligence tool that can be used for national security, military and in-combat efforts; and provide data for the educational and research studies of human anthropology.  Overall, the resulting commercial impact of this transformational technology and the positive contribution it will have to society is immeasurable.",

(Estimate based on market research including a survey of U.S. crime laboratories conducted by InnoGenomics.) Besides hampering investigations, these challenging samples frequently require labor-intensive re-processing before being abandoned, further increasing inefficiencies that contribute to increased costs, lengthy turnaround times, and casework backlogs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In addition, a number of sample types commonly found at crime scenes, such as shed hairs, are often not even submitted for DNA testing due to the low likelihood of obtaining a usable nuclear DNA result. A small percentage of these samples are outsourced to specialized laboratories for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing; however, mtDNA sequencing is limited by reduced discrimination power (~ 1 in 4-5000), inability to differentiate offspring of the same maternal lineage, excessive cost, long turnaround times and the need for a specialized workflow that is challenging for most forensic DNA testing laboratories to implement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;To address the limitations described above and expand the potential of DNA identification testing, InnoGenomics has developed innovative solutions during this SBIR project that are fully compatible with the current qPCR, PCR and capillary electrophoresis (CE) platforms commonly used and validated within most forensic laboratories.
