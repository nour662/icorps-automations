 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers are developing a human-machine synergism in which the machine complements human weaknesses to being innovative while the human returns the favor for the machine. This method called Innovation Assistance (IA) represents a fundamental new way of thinking about innovation and replaces the minimally successful Artificial Intelligence techniques from the 1980's that were unable to get machines to be innovative by themselves. This is accomplished by carefully understanding the fundamental axis upon which all innovation turns: every innovative solution is based upon at least one overlooked (i.e., obscure) feature of the problem. Humans and machines have different reasons for overlooking obscure features. Each partner in the human-machine interaction will help counter the other?s weaknesses. Researchers have thus far devised nearly two dozen innovation techniques that counteract the many cognitive reasons why humans overlook obscure features. \r\n\r\nThis technology has applications for STEM education, lawyers, the military and engineers. The problem-solving model used in this method has the potential to be used to alter innovative education in STEM fields. Techniques developed through IA will be able to more efficiently search databases for similar solutions to an entered problem. There is potential for this technology to be used in a military setting for training forces to be more innovative problem solvers in the field. Engineering applications of this technology could assist in moving projects more rapidly through research and development phases. This technology addresses a growing need to improve the innovation capabilities of individuals and organizations.",
