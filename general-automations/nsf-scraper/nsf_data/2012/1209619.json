The host scientists are Dr. Changzhu Jin and Dr. Yuan Wang.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to advance understanding of the evolution and ecology of reptiles during a time of dramatic climate change, as well as during the earliest human inhabitation of China. Fossil reptiles provide clues to a better understanding of how these animals responded in the past to the dangers of climate change and the appearance of humans in their ecosystem.  The results of this study promise to give a much greater ability to predict how these animals will respond in the future during climate change and as humans continue to encroach upon natural habitats.  Lizards and snakes are some of the most diverse animals in the world today, yet are among the least understood in terms of conservation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nICE AGE LIZARDS AND SNAKES FROM SOUTHERN CHINA\n\nDavid Moscato, East Tennessee State University\n\nHosts: Dr. Changzhu Jin and Dr. Yuan Wang, IVPP, Beijing\n\n \n\nThe purpose of my research project in China this past summer was to expand the field of reptile paleontology in China, particularly focused on the Pleistocene &ndash; the \"Ice Age.\"  This period of time is well-studied in China; a great deal of research has been done regarding early humans and other fossil mammals from this time, but next to nothing is known about the reptilian ecosystem.  My research focuses on the fossil squamates &ndash; lizards and snakes &ndash;from a series of Chinese fossil sites.\n                 I spent the summer at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing, looking through collections of fossil material previously excavated from Chinese caves that yield Ice Age fossils, and setting aside the small reptile remains that I am interested in studying.  Over the course of the summer, I was able to collect reptile fossils from the collections of ten different fossil sites from across the country: one from the Shanxi province; one from the Anhui province; and eight from a series of mountains in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.  Each of these fossil sites dates to a different time within the last 2 million years or so, offering a sequence of fossil sites that span the Ice Age from beginning to end.  So looking at the fossils from these sites will offer great insight into how the ancient Chinese ecosystem was changing throughout the course of the Ice Age, a time when the climate was changing dramatically, important new species (including humans) were appearing for the first time, and in Guangxi, mountains were (and are) still rising.  In total, I recovered well over 200 individual snake fossils, and approximately 100 individual lizard fossils.\n                 Now that these fossils are set aside, I can go about analyzing and identifying them individually, which I will do back home in the United   States.  Once the fossils are identified, I and my colleagues will be able to write up a list of species present in these caves, and make interpretations about the Ice Age ecosystems of China.  As of this writing, I have not begun this detailed analysis yet, but I was able to get a good look at a lot of the fossil material during my time in China, and I can state with confidence that there are at least ten different species of lizards and snakes in these collections, perhaps many more.  This information, once published, will be an essential part of our understanding of ancient Chinese ecosystems, adding to our knowledge of how the modern world came to be, and how animals have responded to drastic environmental change in the past.  \n                 My research focuses on lizards and snakes because these animals are poorly understood, both in the ancient and modern ecosystems of China.  Understanding how these animals have lived through the past two million years will improve our understanding of their evolutionary history.  Furthermore, understanding how these animals were to the dramatic changes in climate, environments, and ecosystems during the Pleistocene will aid in modern-day conservation efforts to protect wildlife from the devastating effects of the changes humans have been imposing on the world around them, including hazards such as global warming, habitat destruction and pollution.  My hope is that this research will pave the way for many more similar projects in the future.  I would like for this to be the beginning of a revolution in our understanding of ancient Chinese reptiles.  There is much more work to be done, and I want to be a part of it.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Moscato"
