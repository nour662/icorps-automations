 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal involves the analysis of data from the Michigan Study of Adolescent Life Transitions (MSALT) and the Childhood and Beyond Study (CAB), two longitudinal datasets originally created by the principal investigator.  The researchers will also collect additional waves of data collection for each of the two datasets. The project draws theoretical support from Expectancy Value Theory, also developed by the principal investigator.  The researchers will collect new data to expand the existing datasets as a way to explore issues of generational effects on STEM engagement, analyses of non-STEM and STEM majors from across multiple disciplines, and additional psychosocial variables that may contribute to STEM engagement. Additional issues of interest include predictors of individual differences in STEM career trajectories and labor market experiences as predictors of STEM career choices. Data analytic techniques include structural equation modeling, hierarchical linear modeling, and person-centered techniques such as cluster analysis and latent class analysis. \r\n\r\nThe major goal of this project is investigate gender differences and within-gender individual differences in the development of STEM-related interests. The under-representation of females in many STEM fields continues to be a striking labor force statistic. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the factors influencing females' choices to pursue specific STEM fields. Such information is vital to devising programs and policies aimed at changing gender-role stereotypes and gender differences in the value of STEM related majors and occupations.",

Several major findings emerged:  a) that parents and teachers make a difference in the youths pursuits? of STEM careers; and b) that students? beliefs in their abilities in math and English predict their later STEM career choices in complex ways. \n\n \n\nFirst, we found that parents and teachers make a difference in the youths? academic pursuits.  Parents with nontraditional attitudes about gender roles transmit these attitudes toward their children which during their high school years set the youth on a pathway that affects their career choice during emerging adulthood.  Few choose STEM careers, but those who do have held nontraditional views on gender roles since childhood.  Further, children?s worrying about their academic performance in such core subjects as mathematics and English has profound implications for their learning and well-being in school.
