 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to delineate and understand variability in the mesosphere-lower thermosphere due to the interaction of atmospheric tides and planetary waves.  The approach is to employ temperature measurements from the TIMED and EOS satellites, data recorded by ground-based wind radars, and an observation-driven, nonlinear mechanistic model. Satellite data will be used to diagnose planetary waves and to recover the spectrum of diurnal tides. Global tidal winds will be computed from the observed temperature tides, and synthesized at longitudes and latitudes of individual radars.  A comparative analysis with the radar data will then be used to validate the global tidal winds and to illuminate the extent to which local temporal variations can be attributed to global-scale influences including cross-hemisphere coupling.  The underlying mechanisms and origins of tide-planetary wave interaction, including forcing terms, relative importance compared to other tidal sources and the role of atmospheric background conditions will be diagnosed from various model runs.",

Space weather is a domain of compelling scientific inquiry, due to neutral-plasma interactions in the presence of a magnetic field that involve non-linearity, feedback, and cover a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Prominent examples for practical reasons to study space weather include plasma density variations that can severely disrupt communications and navigation signals, and neutral density variations important for predicting satellite orbits and re-entry trajectories. Developing predicitive space weather capabilities (in a way similar to weather predicition) is thus an important task for a technological society.</p>\n<p>A key driver of space weather are global-scale atmospheric motions, so called atmospheric tides, triggered by the absorption of sunlight, latent heat release in large thunderstorm clouds and nonlinear processes in Earth's stratosphere and mesosphere. The associated wind fields cause large electric fields in the so-called E-region (about 105 km above ground) that cause vertical ion motions and changes in the plasma density around 400 km altitude. Atmospheric tides can only be studied from satellites because of their global nature and the focus of the project was on atmospheric tides in the E-region.</p>\n<p>The main outcome of the project was the development of the first satellite-based database of tidal weather, that is, resolving atmospheric tide activity with a time resolution of a few days using data from NASA's TIMED satellite.

These data assimilation systems are critical milestones towards predicitive space weather capabilities. The project results showed the strengths and shortcomings of these systems and, in the case of WACCM+DART, has already led to improvements.
