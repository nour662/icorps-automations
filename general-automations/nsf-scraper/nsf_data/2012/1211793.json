 "awd_abstract_narration": "As astrophysicists expand their knowledge of the formation and evolution of the Universe, tying large-scale cosmological galaxy formation scenarios to the measured and inferred details of individually observed galaxies has become increasingly feasible.  This project is an integrated program of observational and theoretical studies designed to determine the distribution of both dark and luminous matter within a large sample of spiral galaxies and to compare these measurements with the predictions of galaxy formation in the concordance cosmological model.\r\n\r\nUsing the wide-field spectroscopic imaging Fabry-Perot instrument on the Southern African Large Telescope, the investigators propose to obtain high-resolution velocity maps of the galaxies, supplemented with more extended but lower resolution 21-cm maps from the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and, later, MeerKAT (Karoo Array Telescope).  Combined with optical and near-infrared surface photometry, these data will be the basis for measurement of the total mass distribution within each galaxy.  Stellar population synthesis estimates and detailed hydrodynamical modeling will determine the separation into baryonic and dark matter components.  Extensive N-body simulations will test the stability of the models, sharpening the determination of the separate contributions of luminous and dark matter.  After correction for the gravitational compression by the baryonic disk, the density, concentration, and circular speed of these halo models will be compared to the expected values derived from cosmological simulations.  Discrepancies may suggest ways to improve and extend the physics in the galaxy formation simulations.  A new analysis tool will measure non-axisymmetric patterns of motion in the two-dimensional kinematic maps of the galaxies, leading to a determination of the shapes of the dark halos.  The investigators will also use Fabry-Perot observations of stellar absorption lines in early-type barred disk galaxies to determine the bar's rotation speed.  As dynamical friction with the halo slows the bar's motion, this measurement will yield another constraint on the halo density in these galaxies.  Sharpened by dynamical constraints, estimates for the mass-to-light ratios of galaxies aim to refine the poorly-known relation between mass-to-light and broad-band colors of disk galaxies.\r\n\r\nEducationally, the proposing team will disseminate their results to the broader community through public lectures and in New Jersey schools.  They will involve undergraduate and graduate students in their research and mentor them in their professional development in the sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe team undertook an integrated program of observational and theoretical studies designed to determine the distribution of both dark and luminous matter within spiral galaxies, with a view to testing the predictions of galaxy formation from state-of-the-art cosmological models.\n\nWe commissioned the Fabry-Perot imaging spectrograph  on the Southern African Large Telescope and developed it into a standard instrument available for all users of the telescope.  Using the unique capabilities and wide-field of view of this instrument, we obtained high-resolution velocity maps of  a targeted sample of 19 galaxies having a wide range of properties.  In order to characterize the velocity pattern in each galaxy to larger radii, we complemented these data with more extended (but lower resolution) radio spectral line maps of neutral hydrogen gas obtained at the Very Large Array.  Multi-color surface photometry obtained at Cerro Tololo Observatory, that is already calibrated, will be used to estimate the visible mass of each galaxy.  We moderate the unknown scaling from light to mass by running N-body simulations of a range of models for each galaxy to determine the disk mass that supports a spiral arm pattern matching that ovserved, and thereby determine the separation into visible and dark matter components.  Discrepancies between the density profiles of the derived dark halos and those expected from cosmological simulations may provide constraints on the properties of the dark matter and/or suggest ways to improve the modeling of galaxy formation.\n\nThe PI and CoI have trained both US and South African undergraduate and graduate students in the techniques of research, computerized data reduction methods, and the extraction and presentation of scientific findings.
