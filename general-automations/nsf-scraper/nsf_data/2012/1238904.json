 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Targeted Infusion Project entitled -Fostering Innovation and Excellence in Computing Systems: Establishing an Innovative Systems Laboratory - has the goal to foster innovation in undergraduate students in the Computer Science program. To foster innovation, this project uses a novel approach which systematically introduces innovation in a step-wise fashion in six courses, followed by the completion of a senior design project in the Innovative Systems Laboratory. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to introduce innovation in six fundamental computer science courses using top down and bottom up approaches; create a web service, cloud computing and mobile computing based infrastructure framework and the associated infrastructure components within this general framework; and use this general framework to develop innovative web services and cloud computing based computing systems projects. The anticipated outcomes of this project are an increase in the number of undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in computer science (African American, Hispanic, and women), who learn the skills to innovate and demonstrate that they can use the current technologies to create innovative computing systems. The approach is scalable and replicable. This project will provide detailed setup instructions, training guides, source code and documentation to other small Computer Science programs nationwide.",

All the faculties were on board to introduce innovation into computer science education, by having students work on project ideas that were innovative from the very first course of computer science degree plan.

As part of the top-down approach of the project, senior design students presented their ideas to the junior, sophomore and freshman students.
