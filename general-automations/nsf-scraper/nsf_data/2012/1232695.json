 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has long been received wisdom that investment in science greatly facilitates the technological progress that ultimately improves economic productivity and living standards. Unfortunately, the systematic and quantitative evidence to support these arguments remains thin and expensive to produce. Name ambiguity makes this difficult: different scientists may share the same names, and conversely, the same scientist may have their name listed differently within or across publication and patent databases. As a consequence, the collaborative networks of scientists remain unidentified, and the gatekeepers between science and technology have not been systematically identified. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project develops a large-scale database that links Medline papers and U.S. patents, through identification of individuals who authored both papers and patents using state-of-the-art name disambiguation algorithms. These patent-paper-author links in turn enable identification of similar organizations and in some cases, science/technology fields and geography. The resulting database is used in three exemplary analyses that aim to: 1) study the impact of grants upon science and technical productivity, 2) identify the gatekeepers between science and technology and study how knowledge flows between these two realms, and 3) understand how collaborative, institutional, organizational, and regional factors influence these processes. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The resulting database is publicly available. This both enables science policy scholars to develop systematic and convincing evidence for investment recommendations and enables person-centered research of the science-technology interface of numerous other kinds.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWho will discover the next scientific breakthrough?  Put another way, given the scientists in a given field, who will discover the biggest breakthrough in the following year?  Or even win a Nobel Prize?\n\nWe first disambiguated the PubMed database (disambiguation means to figure out all the papers written by each author in the database, it's a hard computing and statistical problem, but we don't dwell on it here).  We then determined all the scientists who might have discovered RNA interference, a Nobel Prize winning effort by Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, in 1998.  We took all the bibliometric information about them that was available in 1997 (from all their published research to that date), and based on that, tried to predict who would discover the Nobel Prize in 1998.\n\nWe reviewed and applied current theories on creativity and breakthroughs, and modeled, using publication data from 1997 and before, four outcomes: 1) the productivity of each scientist in 1998, 2) the citation counts to papers written by each scientist in that year, 3) the chance of discovering a paper that would be in the top 10% of cited papers in1998, and 4) the chance that they would discover a Nobel Prize.\n\nFor future productivity, the biggest predictor was, not surprisingly, past productivity.  More interestingly, authors who were more productive in the past were less likely to discover a breakthrough, perhaps because they focused on volume at the expense of high reward, high risk work.  Years of experience also had a negative effect, once prior productivity was taken into account.\n\nFor future citations to a person's scientific publications, prior citations had a positive impact, experience had a negative effect, and being a newcomer to the field had a small positive impact (newcomers were often doctoral students or post docs in a lab).  Being a broker, a scientist who worked with other scientists who in turn did not work with each other, had a small positive impact.  The effect of brokerage became increasingly positive with more important outcomes.\n\nFor publishing a paper in the top 10% of citations in the field, prior productivity and citation both had positive impacts.  Experience had a negative impact and being a newcomer and a broker had positive impacts.\n\nFor discovering the Nobel Prize, there were negative effects of prior productivity and being in the technical core of the field.  There were positive effects to being highly cited, a broker, having deep expertise, and being a newcomer.\n\nThe sizes of effects became smaller and smaller with the more important outcomes.  In other words, the amount we could predict shrunk dramatically, from about 50% for productivity to 1% for the Nobel Prize.  These size results dramatically reinforce just how risky it is to do leading edge science, the difficulty of predicting a particular outcome, and the importance of funding a broad array of diverse research.\n\nTaken together, the research implies that Nobel Prize winning scientists have deep expertise, are not too far along in their careers, work outside of the \"core\" of their field, don't try to publish a lot of papers, and work with a wide variety of people who otherwise don't work with one another.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/10/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lee Fleming"
