 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Track-1 award seeks to understand complex, coupled human-natural interactions. The specific focus is to evaluate vulnerabilities, resilience, and adaptive capacities of Alaskan communities to the effects of environmental changes occurring in their region.  The work involves interdisciplinary research and education in the area of Social Ecological Systems (SES) and is scientifically significant and regionally relevant. The project participants are the three main campuses of the University of Alaska (UA) located in the urban centers of Fairbanks (UAF), Anchorage (UAA), and Juneau (UA Southeast - UAS), 13 satellite campuses in rural areas across Alaska, a Tribal College, and learning centers in small communities around the state. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe Alaska Adapting to Changing Environments (Alaska ACE) project will examine how the pronounced changes in the environmental and natural processes affect and are affected by the adaptation capacity of Alaskan communities. The work is organized around three Test Cases in the Southeast, Southcentral, and Northern Alaska to study the changes in landscape and water resources.  The project will also support processes that enable communities to better adapt to environmental changes. The results of the Test Cases study will be linked in a broader comparative framework by a Coordination, Integration, and Synthesis Working Group. This group will undertake integrated modeling and deliver research findings as decision-support tools, hold annual Regional Outreach Workshops, and help to craft cyber-enabled visualizations of SES modeling results. Policymakers, resource managers, and members of the public will be invited to participate in 'Decision Theater' events in which they will be able to use decision support tools in real time to view and manipulate possible scenarios of environmental changes and adaptive strategies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe Alaska ACE project will advance interdisciplinary SES research methodology and translate research results into visualization tools useful for researchers, local communities, resource managers, and policy makers.  The program will train and educate a diverse set of students across Alaska and strengthen partnerships with local communities, government and non-government organizations.  At the college level, the program focuses on the training and mentoring of junior faculty and graduate and undergraduate students through grant-writing workshops, interdisciplinary science courses and seminars, student fellowships and internships, and travel support to professional conferences. Engagement of rural, mostly Alaska Native, K-12 students and teachers is targeted through summer scholarships and ongoing statewide programs. Partnerships with the private sector are enabled through student internships at Native Corporations and competitive grants to assist small Alaskan businesses apply for large federal and state funding.  The Alaska ACE project will build human capacity for STEM research and education as well as the infrastructure for sustained engagement of rural campuses, local communities, resource managers, and policy makers in socially relevant science.",

Researchers used sensors and mapping to track changes, with a focus on landscape and hydrologic change, then conducted surveys and interviews to gauge how people anticipate and adjust to these changes. They produced scenarios, visualizations, and other products to illustrate communities' ability to adapt, and to improve their capacity to make informed policy decisions. Researchers did significant work with local stakeholders, and one important product is \"Sharing Questions, Sharing Answers,\" a report on ACE stakeholder engagement.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Southeast Test Case</strong> <strong>(SETC) </strong>studied climate-driven changes to the \"icefield-to-estuary\" ecosystem of Berners Bay, near Juneau, and human responses to them. One outcome was an integrated model of the ecosystem, which was combined with social data to assess the ability of resource managers and tourism businesses to adapt to social and ecological changes. The test case produced literature and held symposia to educate tour guides and tourists about ecosystem changes. Researchers also made findings on subjects such as the amount of organic carbon that melting glaciers transfer to oceans; impacts of climate change on salmon run timing and habitat quality; the role of climate-driven disturbances in shaping northern rainforests; and the economic value of services provided by ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>The Southcentral Test Case</strong> <strong>(SCTC)</strong> examined the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage, with a focus on salmon fisheries. A major activity was \"Salmon 2050,\" which brought together stakeholders from local agencies and nonprofits to generate scenarios of how the Kenai may change over the coming decades. Results were shared with agencies and have impacted strategies and land-use plans. Test case findings were summarized in a <em>Fisheries</em> journal article, which found environmental change on the Kenai will likely harm some salmon populations while benefiting others, and that maintaining diverse habitats and salmon runs may enable ecosystems and fisheries to thrive. Test case researchers published on numerous other subjects, such as current and historic salmon dynamics; precipitation and air temperature trends; and a social network analysis method used to select Salmon 2050 participants.</p>\n<p><strong>The Northern Test Case</strong> <strong>(NTC)</strong> focused on the arctic village of Nuiqsut, which sits on the front lines of both climate change and resource development. One significant product is a report comparing local residents' perceptions of change with instrumented climate change data (a relationship known as P-delta-I). The document finds P-delta-I in Nuiqsut to be a complex topic, as many interviewees disagreed about the direction of change or reported no change, and in some cases local observations differed markedly from instrumented findings. A separate accomplishment of the test case was exploring new ways to facilitate community involvement in research, such as a successful program asking hunters to record observations of change using camera-equipped GPS units. Other areas of research included ice road construction; permafrost landforms; shrub expansion and wildlife patterns; adaptive governance; \"research fatigue\" among Nuiqsut's much-studied residents; arctic fish populations; and indigenous knowledge.</p>\n<p>One <strong>CIS Group</strong> product was a data-driven interactive model of a Kenai-like fishery, which can be used to forecast the potential impact of regulation changes or salmon run-timing dynamics. CIS researchers also crafted a dataset displaying P-delta-I, and interviewed resource managers and NGO representatives from the Southeast and Southcentral test case areas about P-delta-I. Results suggest that most perceptions of change were inconsistent with measured change, which the authors posit may result from \"an interaction among media attention, the association of air and stream temperatures with climate change and climate change belief, personal experience and experiential risk perception.\"</p>\n<p>ACE contributed to career development at the University of Alaska by hiring six faculty members and involving more than 90 faculty, 90 undergraduates and 50 graduate students, including a cohort of midcareer Ph.D. students focused on social and ecological systems. ACE conducted widespread education programs such as Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE), through which K-12 students learned about climate change through scientific observation, and grants to encourage Alaska Native students to engage in STEM activities. ACE built new sensor networks and campus visualization spaces and augmented existing ones, and also contributed to Alaskan economic development through support for entrepreneurship awards and programs.</p>\n<p>ACE?s interdisciplinary, broad-based efforts raised the profile of research at the University of Alaska and encouraged collaborations that stretched across disciplines and the state's far-flung campuses. The program generated significant new data and increased research capacity and scientific understanding at the university and across the state, setting the stage for continued research into critical questions of northern environmental change and adaptation.</p>\n<p>For more information visit www.alaska.edu/epscor/archive/phase-4/.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/18/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anupma&nbsp;Prakash</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1208927/1208927_10189987_1555357284918_SETC-1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1208927/1208927_10189987_1555357284918_SETC-1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Hood fieldwork\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1208927/1208927_10189987_1555357284918_SETC-1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Hood fieldwork\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Southeast Test Case faculty Eran Hood (center) and students Alez Botelho (l) and Alex Whitehead (r) take water samples from a Juneau-area waterway.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">photo by Mark Rainery</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Anupma&nbsp;Prakash</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Hood fieldwork</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1208927/1208927_10189987_1555357203542_NTC-4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1208927/1208927_10189987_1555357203542_NTC-4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Zhou fieldwork\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1208927/1208927_10189987_1555357203542_NTC-4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Zhou fieldwork\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Northern Test Case graduate student Jiake Zhou measures of shrubs along the Colville River on Alaska?s North Slope.

Results suggest that most perceptions of change were inconsistent with measured change, which the authors posit may result from \"an interaction among media attention, the association of air and stream temperatures with climate change and climate change belief, personal experience and experiential risk perception.\"\n\nACE contributed to career development at the University of Alaska by hiring six faculty members and involving more than 90 faculty, 90 undergraduates and 50 graduate students, including a cohort of midcareer Ph.D. students focused on social and ecological systems. ACE conducted widespread education programs such as Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE), through which K-12 students learned about climate change through scientific observation, and grants to encourage Alaska Native students to engage in STEM activities. ACE built new sensor networks and campus visualization spaces and augmented existing ones, and also contributed to Alaskan economic development through support for entrepreneurship awards and programs.\n\nACE?s interdisciplinary, broad-based efforts raised the profile of research at the University of Alaska and encouraged collaborations that stretched across disciplines and the state's far-flung campuses. The program generated significant new data and increased research capacity and scientific understanding at the university and across the state, setting the stage for continued research into critical questions of northern environmental change and adaptation.\n\nFor more information visit www.alaska.edu/epscor/archive/phase-4/.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/18/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anupma Prakash"
