 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to build on and extend the success of the current Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU-Poly) and take it on a path towards self-sustainability.  It leverages and improves the resources and infrastructure generated by the current SFS program to prepare a cadre of SFS scholars who can tackle security and privacy problems from multiple viewpoints. The program instills a cybersecurity mindset that looks beyond just technology while approaching problems. The project supports an educational program that relies on a number of high-quality courses in the area of information assurance (IA), participation in research projects supervised by faculty, hands-on experience both at NYU-Poly and during summer internships, and state of the art infrastructure for IA research. In addition to providing technical skills and research experiences, the program nurtures and develops leadership and communication skills, and good citizenship. The proposed project has an important mission of preparing cybersecurity professionals for positions in agencies of the Federal, state, local and tribal government. Using knowledge and skills obtained in the program, the graduates are well prepared to meet challenges of protecting the information and infrastructure resources of our Nation.",
