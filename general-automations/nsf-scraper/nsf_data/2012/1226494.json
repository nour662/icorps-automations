 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tropical soils are not uniformly kaolinite-rich and nutrient-depleted, and this project aims to examine rates and mechanisms of mineral reactions (and associated chemical changes) that occur with maturation of tropical soils. Ultimately, pronounced leaching of base cations and silica drives humid tropical soil solutions towards a nutrient-poor, low pH, Al-rich composition that favors crystallization of kaolinite; however, data of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations indicate that 65 % of tropical soils do not fit this end-member Oxisol state. Pedogenic Fe-smectite (S) forms in many tropical soils as a metastable precursor to kaolinite (K), and a recent study of a humid tropical soil sequence by the PI and collaborator in Costa Rica indicates that the transformation of S to K occurs over time spans on the order of about 100,000 years via intermediate kaolinite-smectite (K-S) phases. The reaction occurs on a layer-by-layer basis, and the preservation of S layers within K-S crystals enables Al to be sequestered in expandable S interlayers, thus limiting plant-toxic Al in solution. Furthermore, the cation exchange capacity of K-S is about 5 times greater than K, further underscoring the need to better constrain these reactions. Accordingly, this project seeks to test the hypothesis that humid tropical soils, regardless of mean annual precipitation (MAP), undergo step-wise transformation from S to K-S before ultimately producing K. This hypothesis will be tested by examining the roles of time and climate (as MAP) on the rates and mechanisms of the S to K-S to K reaction in soil chronosequences from three separate climate zones along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Preliminary data indicate that rate is positively correlated to MAP. Mineral reaction mechanisms will also be examined by carrying out synthesis reactions where solution composition and time are controlled. \r\nMiddlebury College is a residential liberal arts college with a long tradition of involving students in hands-on, experiential research. This is particularly true in the Geology Department, which over many decades has cultivated a critical-thinking, problem-oriented curriculum that includes a required year-long senior thesis. Positive demographic changes in the Geology Dept provide a much greater opportunity for this and all projects in the department to extend to typically underrepresented students. Graduating geology majors from the classes of 2008 to 2013 are comprised of 15 % (8/53) American students of color, whereas the geology majors from 2000 to 2007 consisted of less than 2 % American students of color (1/65). Female students comprise 46 % of geology majors over the past 15 years, and in the classes of 2012 and 2013 combined, 13/19 students are female. 15% of Middlebury geology theses result in co-authored publications with faculty, and 50 % of Middlebury geology majors attend graduate school, so these demographic shifts present the opportunity to add diversity to the broader geologic community. Thus, this project will target a diverse group of students in a strong program with a proven record of success in undergraduate research. The project also has an international undergraduate scope, which includes a field excursion to the Osa Peninsula to do field work with University of Costa Rica (UCR) geologist Guillermo Alvarado and undergraduate students from UCR and Middlebury College, as well as analytical and experimental research at the Instituto Andaluz de Ciencias de la Tierra in Granada Spain, where the PI and students will collaborate on detailed mineralogical and geochemical analysis of tropical soils.\r\nThe NSF Office of International Science and Engineering contributed to the international component of this project.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Given that soils in the humid tropics vary significantly in clay mineralogy, bulk geochemistry and cation exchange capacity (CEC), three chronosequences (<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">&lt;</span> 120 ka) of marine terrace soils on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica were examined in order to constrain reaction rates and mechanisms. The three study locations differ mainly as a function of mean annual precipitation, ranging from 3000 mm/yr on the southern Nicoya Peninsula to 4500 mm/yr on the Osa Peninsula. CEC of the clay fraction (&lt; 2 &micro;m) of soils was observed to vary as a function of both temporal and climatic gradients. In each chronosequence, CEC decreases with increasing soil age in conjunction with a shift in clay mineralogy from pedogenic smectite in Holocene soils (CEC = 48 to 90 cmolc/kg) to interstratified kaolinite-smectite (K-S; CEC = 18 to 45 cmolc/kg) and finally to halloysite and kaolinite in Pleistocene soils (CEC = 2 to 18 cmolc/kg). This mineralogical transition is driven by the leaching of base cations and Si from soil. Superimposed on the temporal control on CEC is regional variation in mean annual precipitation.</p>\n<p>Soil weathering reactions, and the corresponding drop in CEC, were observed to occur at a rate three-to-four times greater in an Inceptisol to Oxisol sequence in the wettest climate (Osa, 4500 mm/yr) compared to a similar sequence in the drier Esterillos area (3250 mm/yr MAP); in the driest soils (Nicoya), this evolved, low-CEC (&lt; 10 cmolc/kg) state does not occur, even after 120 ka of soil formation. The dominant exchangeable cation at all sites is Ca. Interlayer K and Al appear to be largely fixed and to increase relative to Ca over time, resulting in interstratified K-S with smectite layers that become progressively more vermiculite-like and illite-like with time. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The aged-related evolution of these soils is likely to occur in any moist tropical landscape where periodic tectonism, erosion or volcanism produces unweathered parent material at the land surface.<span>The results stemming from this project show that soils in tropical volcanic arc environments are systematically altered over time, and that the main controls on soil mineralogy, CEC and bulk chemistry are soil age and mean annual precipitation. In terms of mineralogical change, results of this project (1) document through synthesis experiments the mechanisms by which smectite soil clays are altered to kaolinite over time (Ryan and Huertas, 2013), and (2) provide an explanation for the origin of halloysite in tropical soils (Ryan et al., 2016). Results also document the relationship of soil mineralogy to CEC, provide detailed analysis of interlayer and exchangeable cations as they change over time in tropical soils, and quantify rate of mineralogical and CEC change. This project has resulted in a new testable hypothesis that tropical soils in any volcanic arc environment should change systematically as a function of soil age and rainfall, and that a predictive model could be developed for soils in such systems. This is especially important for tropical regions where soil mapping, chemical and mineralogical analysis is sparse.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Peter&nbsp;C&nbsp;Ryan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1226494/1226494_10210291_1480446393052_GradypredictivemodelFall2016K-S--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1226494/1226494_10210291_1480446393052_GradypredictivemodelFall2016K-S--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Map of predictive model of soil mineralogy, Pacific coast, Costa Rica\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1226494/1226494_10210291_1480446393052_GradypredictivemodelFall2016K-S--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Map of predictive model of soil mineralogy, Pacific coast, Costa Rica\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Predictive model of soil mineralogy, Pacific coast, Costa Rica.
