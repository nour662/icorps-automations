 "awd_abstract_narration": "With a RUI grant from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism Program in the NSF Chemistry Division, Professor Steven Stevenson will carry out research on oxometallic fullerenes (OMFs), which consist of metallic oxide clusters encapsulated within fullerenes.  Research goals include the (1) discovery and synthesis of new OMFs, (2) novel separation methods, (3) functionalization chemistry, and (4) characterization (e.g., magnetic, electrochemical, X-ray, NMR).  Stevenson will also develop sustainability technologies to address the depletion of expensive and rare metals (e.g., Sc, Lu) used in their synthesis.  A special feature of these OMF molecules is their ability to form clusters containing the most atoms trapped inside a fullerene.  \r\n\r\nStevenson's sample dissemination network and exchange of scientific ideas includes both domestic and international scientists.  The research program promotes participation of undergraduate student researchers at the host institution as well as local community college students at early stages in their academic careers.  Students will develop technical skills (e.g., instrumentation, lab work), communication skills (e.g., publications, presentations) and people skills (e.g., lab participation within a team environment).  With the proposed plan, a community college/undergraduate student can have 2 to 4 years of research experiences to better prepare themselves for graduate school, industry, or other careers (e.g., medical, pharmacy).",

Fullerenes are hollow molecules whose skeleton consists of carbon atoms arranged in pentagon and hexagon rings.  In this project, the PI has placed oxygen and nitrogen inside the fullerene cage by bonding these nonmetals to metals.  \n\nOur first objective was to demonstrate a successful synthesis of new metal oxide and metal nitride fullerenes.  We used an electric-arc reactor to make these new molecules at high temperatures, which were required for their creation.   When formed in our plasma reactor and deposited as soot upon cooling, the metallofullerenes are subsequently extracted and identified.  In our second objective, we have discovered and developed new purification methods to isolate these new molecules from their soot contaminants.  \n\nA key outcome of this project is successfully achieving a total isolation of new metallofullerenes by manipulating their differing chemical reactivities.  This is a significant achievement because our project's purification method can now replace the conventional method of chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, HPLC.  For experiments requiring the infrastructure and expertise at R1, Ph.D. universities, we have developed a collaborative network so that additional experiments and characterization can be performed.\n\nThe project has made an impact on the \"fullerene\" discipline because the PI has published how to synthesize these new metal oxide and metal nitride metallofullerenes.  The PI has also disseminated to the world how to produce AND how to purify these new molecules without using the cumbersome, expensive, and tedious current HPLC method.  By replacing the commonly used, HPLC purification approach with our project's new chemical based separation, the door will now be opened to scientists worldwide to finally have larger amounts of these purified metallofullerene samples available to them for experimentation.   Before this project, there was a significant sample availability problem.  A key outcome of this project is plenty of sample can now be available to others because they can copy our new separation and isolation strategies.\n\nAnother outcome is the PI's work with a diverse group of students.  Specifically, the PI has accepted for this project, undergraduate students, besides chemistry majors, from other disciplines such as engineering, biology, geology, psychology, and nursing.  An advantage of the PI's incorporations of such a wide diversity of majors is the opportunity to solve research problems from a multiplicity of perspectives.  \n\nThe PI's sample dissemination network also includes student researchers at other universities to perform other experiments on our purified samples.  For example, non-PI students who receive our purified samples also have an opportunity for inclusion.  Another outcome of this project was acquisition of the department's first ever MALDI TOF mass spectrometer, which has used and shared with students to analyzed samples containing our new molecules.\n\nThe PI's sample dissemination network also leverages and merges multiple universities.  An outcome of this network is the sharing of samples, experiments, results, and findings.  Another outcome of this project is the placement of the PI's project results (i.e., publications and presentations) into our university depository, OPUS, for sharing and dissemination of our findings.  A purpose of this website \"OPUS: Research &amp; Creativity at IPFW\" is (1) to support the open access to the academic and creative accomplishments of IPFW faculty and students, (2) identify IPFW's published work and (3) to provide access to the full text of that work whenever possible.\n\nThe project has made an impact on technology transfer because our scientific findings on the synthesis and chemical purification have an effect on chemical companies that manufacture, sell, and develop intellectual property.
