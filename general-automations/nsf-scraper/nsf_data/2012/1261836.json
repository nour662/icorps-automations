 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advanced Laboratory for Visual Anthropology (ALVA) is a new facility that puts the tools of digital cinema production into the hands of researchers. This project will utilize ALVA to further advances in anthropological imaging.  This project will enable researchers to undertake visual anthropological projects in collaboration with planetarium science centers, textbook publishers and cultural resources managers. The ALVA facility has the potential to enhance research in visual anthropology through 4K cinema production. The project continues this enhancement, bringing anthropological content into full-dome planetarium environment. \r\n\r\nIf successfully completed, this project plans to translate the results of scientific research into the medium of digital cinema enabling transmission of these results across multiple platforms including streaming over the Internet and projection onto full-dome planetarium screens. It has the potential to create digital cinema resources for educators and students. The infrastructure and technologies enhanced through this project may enable further dissemination of the results of anthropological research through digital cinema and technological channels.",
