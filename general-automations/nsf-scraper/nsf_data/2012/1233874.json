Precipitation impacts on aerosol indirect effects will be examined using remotely-sensed airborne VOCALS datasets and satellite-derived values. Aerosol transport pathways, their influence on and interactions with the southeast Atlantic stratocumulus deck at synoptic and diurnal time scales will also be examined, using a  suite of observational datasets and reanalyses encompassing multiple years. A combination of approaches (empirical orthogonal functions, compositing, and backtrajectories and Lagrangian particle dispersion modeling) will be utilized. \r\n\r\nThis project will improve understanding the dynamical influences on aerosol-cloud interactions in the Southern Hemisphere. This has the potential to improve the capability of future climate predictions; thus this activity has substantial broader impacts.",
