 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is matching academic rigor with experiential, interdisciplinary learning in a sequence of two courses that ground students firmly in their place of study: Bennington, Vermont, and its environs. Former mill towns like Bennington dot the New England landscape. These are not the urban centers at the forefront of sustainable design; but neither are they rural outposts or quickly spreading suburbs. Through analysis of past resource-use regimes and human-environment interactions, students in this project are gaining insight into what a sustainable future could be.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum is designed mainly for juniors and seniors and for environmental studies students, although it is also appropriate for students concentrating in other disciplines, as well as students interested in learning more about their new college home.\r\n\r\nThe first course, \"The Future of a New England Mill Town,\" provides the geographic specificity needed for students to understand how social, political, and biophysical processes influence each other. This introductory course highlights core STEM knowledge (from ecology, chemistry, geology, architecture, and psychology) central to sustainability issues, and it also examines how STEM knowledge and approaches are integrated in a larger societal whole through real problems in a tangible, localized setting.\r\n\r\nThe second course is an advanced projects course that involves individual internships with regional organizations during the college's seven-week, non-residential winter Field Work Term. In this course, students collaboratively design and implement case studies that address issues of sustainability in the Bennington region, drawing on qualitative and quantitative research methods from diverse disciplines. Results from projects are archived and compiled as a resource for partner organizations and as a catalyst for the development of future courses and projects.\r\n\r\nWhile creating locally focused place-based curricula, the investigators are also developing teaching tools that have general applicability in integrating student experience with any locality. Ongoing relationships with local community organizations, K-12 teachers, other colleges in the region, and others with unique knowledge lay the groundwork for future collaborations. The investigators are organizing workshops to collaborate with other colleges and K-12 teachers. Local media are disseminating ideas generated from students' projects.",

One goal of this project was to overcome this divide by giving students the skills to understand any \"place\" by analyzing its geophysical landscape, historical development, social, cultural and economic characteristics.  A second goal of the project was to use place-based pedagogy specifically to promote students interest in STEM field, STEM skills and general scientific literacy.\n\nThis grant provided the opportunity to explore these issues in a truly interdisciplinary manner by giving faculty the freedom to meet and construct two courses, one introductory and the other project-based, both team taught by a social scientist and a physical scientist. By integrating social science analysis with STEM skills this grant provided the students with a template of how to find out about a \"place\" from many different perspectives.\n\nOutcomes:\n\nStudents were exposed to the physical landscape by mapping the area, measuring water flow in rivers, walking around the town observing the function of buildings, talking to residents, and attending community functions. Community members gave presentations to the class and nearly every week there was a field trip related to topics discussed in the class.  The students visited an organic farm, the site of iron deposits, Bennington?s former mill buildings, a contemporary water energy generation initiative, and other relevant sites.\nThe second course in the sequence provided the opportunity for individual student projects concerning both conventional 'environmental' concerns (e.g., GIS-based studies of effects of recent highway development and land-use change on habitat fragmentation) and town-planning questions (e.g., pedestrian-friendliness of Bennington's downtown, development of multi-purpose trails linking Bennington and surrounding neighborhoods and businesses, debates about siting of photovoltaic farms).
