 "awd_abstract_narration": "Founded in 1997 at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), Camp Reach is a residential summer science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) enrichment program for rising 7th grade girls, with continuing mentoring, communications and events for participants as they advance from 7th grade through their high school years.  The program extends beyond the participants to involve the girls' parents, middle school mathematics and science teachers, high school students, WPI undergraduate women in STEM and WPI faculty.  Approximately 400 rising 8th grade girls, 110 high school women, 40 middle school mathematics and science teachers and 75 WPI students and faculty have participated over the past 14 years, creating a mentoring scaffold of girls and women who support and celebrate each others' interests in STEM.  In 2003, Camp Reach received a national award from the Women in Engineering ProActive Network for its role in encouraging young women in engineering and science.",
