 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sea level rise reconstructions and predictions are currently limited in accuracy by our incomplete understanding of dynamic ice sheet behavior. Recent research indicates that sea level rise during the Last Interglacial (LIG) period may have been similar to what is projected for later in the 21st century; thus far, however, it has not been possible to produce consistent reconstructions of eustatic sea level change for this period, underscoring the need to better understand the influence of changing ice sheet volume and extent. Glacio-hydro-isostatic effects can obscure the eustatic sea level change signal at sites located near ice sheets, necessitating investigations of sea level change at far-field sites (e.g., the Indian Ocean and Caribbean) where these effects are less severe.\r\n\r\nThis project, led by a faculty member at the University of Florida in collaboration with Australian scientists, uses fossil corals in the Seychelles to reconstruct eustatic sea level via diagenetic assessments, Uranium-series dating, and surveying integrated with geophysical (glacio-hydro-isostatic) modeling. LIG sea level markers across the Caribbean will be also be surveyed. Together, the dataset and model results will place constraints on past ice sheet volumes and extents, which will help to resolve serious disparities (+4 m) in sea level reconstructions, as well as facilitating the generation of a best-estimate eustatic sea level change curve. \r\n\r\nThe integration of sea level change data and geophysical modeling involved in this research aligns closely with the objectives of PALSEA, a PAGES/IMAGES working group created to place empirical constraints on future sea level rise using the paleo record. The work will involve close collaboration between the lead researcher and her international colleagues. Educational impacts include the involvement of undergraduates at the University of Florida enrolled in a \"Geology of the Bahamas\" course, who will directly participate in the field component of this project; in addition, these students will participate in a series of lectures placing the work in context. The project will also be featured in a multimedia exhibit promoting STEM research at the Florida Museum of Natural History. This award will support the professional development of an early-career researcher, as well as the training of a PhD student and several undergraduate assistants.",

The field work conducted also enabled us to conclude that integration of important metadata, such as reef architecture, stratigraphy, and types of corals present are critically important to the robust interpretation of the past position of sea level that is reconstructed using fossil corals.  Our work in Jamaica also revealed the influence of vertical tectonic motions across the island that have occurred in the past 125,000 years.\n\nResults from this research were integrated into a high-impact review paper that assessed the amount of sea level rise during past warm periods in the last 3 million years.
