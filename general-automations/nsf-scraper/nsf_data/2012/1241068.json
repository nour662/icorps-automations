 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microorganisms are abundant in the atmosphere and play an important role in controlling cloud development, cloud chemistry and ultimately weather patterns. They do this primarily by producing enzymes that catalyze the formation (nucleation) of ice crystals at significantly warmer temperatures than would normally be required for ice formation (-2 C vs. -36 C). Despite the atmosphere?s fundamental role in their dispersal, the abundance, diversity and flux of microorganisms in the atmosphere remain largely unknown. The potential of ice-nucleating microorganisms to significantly impact meteorology and promote microbial dispersal during precipitation events motivates this research.  The RAINS project will sample rain, snow and air samples at ground level, and in the lower atmosphere using remote-controlled aircraft.  The project will: (1) characterize microbial taxonomic diversity, including in precipitation that occurred between 1794 AD and present, and which is preserved in glacial ice; (2) determine the genetic diversity of microbial assemblages and of individual ice nucleating bacteria and (3) examine the functional diversity with respect to the role of precipitation and biological ice nucleation on patterns of microbial distribution.  The work will also determine which microbes carried to the Earth?s surface via precipitation present possible inoculum sources for diseases that impact humans, domestic animals, and plants. \r\n\r\nThe RAINS project will increase understanding of biodiversity in the planetary boundary layer of the atmosphere, where important meteorological phenomena such as precipitation occur.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommended developing a better understanding of the effect of aerosols and atmospheric ice formation in order to improve climate models and forecast the impact of rising global temperature. The proposed study will increase knowledge on the nature of the most active ice nucleators in the atmosphere. Microbial ice nucleation may also allow microorganisms and certain plant pathogens to efficiently cycle between the atmosphere and surface habitats, and RAINS will contribute to ongoing efforts to assess the movement of ice nucleating microorganisms across geographical scales. Outreach efforts will take these advances into high school and college classrooms in the form of hands-on research experiences for students at both levels and will serve as the basis for high school educators to develop unique classroom activities. In addition, an international network of scientists collecting field data on the relationship between biological ice nucleator abundance, cropping patterns and precipitation in dry land regions will be established. RAINS will sponsor an international conference that brings together 10 young career scientists in the network to highlight the advances of these investigations and identify the outstanding scientific questions.",

The focus was placed on microorganisms that display ice nucleation activity (INA), in other words, bacteria and fungi that have the ability to catalyze the freezing of water. There is evidence that such organisms contribute to the formation of precipitation in the atmosphere, but little is known about their identity and abundance in rain and snow. The specific objectives of our work were to: (1) culture bacteria from precipitation collected in Blacksburg, Virginia, USA, and test them for INA to determine the frequency of bacteria with INA in precipitation, (2) sequence at least one fragment of one gene of the cultured bacteria with INA to determine to which species they belong to, (3) determine the gene content of microbial assemblages and individual bacteria with INA that are present in the lower atmosphere, and (4) determine the mechanism by which the identified bacteria with INA catalyze the formation of ice.</p>\n<p>Precipitation sampling sites were established at the Kentland Farm in Blacksburg, VA and on the roof of a campus research building. Over a period of 18 months, 23 samples of rain and snow were collected and over 33,000 bacteria were cultured from these samples and tested for INA. The majority of the identified INA bacteria were bacteria that were already known to have INA and that are known to live in association with plants. However, new variants of these bacterial species were identified and their relative abundance in rainfall was determined. The most interesting result was the identification of a previously unknown bacterium with INA: a member of the genus <em>Lysinibacillus</em>. This bacterium was found to catalyze freezing of water using a mechanism not previously known to exist in bacteria: the secretion of a non-proteinaceous molecule with INA. Characterization and identification of this new molecule will be a priority during future studies. This bacterium and/or the molecule it produces could be used in the future in snow making and, possibly, in weather modification to alleviate droughts.</p>\n<p>In another set of experiments, freshwater samples were collected from Claytor Lake, Virginia, USA, between November 2015 and June 2016 and plated on non-selective medium and on medium selective for <em>Pseudomonas</em>. The bacteria were then tested for INA and molecularly identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed surprising genetic diversity. Frequencies of bacteria with INA belonging to the Pseudomonads ranged from 0 to 15% with the highest frequency being found in spring. This work shows that freshwater lakes can be a significant reservoir of bacteria with INA. Future work is needed to determine the contribution of these bacteria to populations present in the atmosphere and on plants.</p>\n<p>A series of experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that at least some of the microbes with INA present in rain may not originate in clouds but instead be scavenged from the lower atmosphere by rainfall. Thirty-three artificial rain events were conducted off the side of the Smart Road Bridge in Blacksburg, Virginia, USA. Sterile water was dispensed over the side of the bridge (simulated rainfall) and recovered in sterile containers on an agricultural field below. Microbes scavenged from the artificial rain events were cultured and their INA was examined. Thirty-four microbes out of a total of 8331 (0.4%) were found to have INA. This work expands our knowledge of the scavenging properties of rainfall, and suggests that at least some ice nucleators in natural precipitation may have been scrubbed from the atmosphere during rainfall, and thus are not likely to be involved in the formation of precipitation.</p>\n<p>We developed and delivered a unique unit for advanced secondary school students (age 16-18) to explore biological INA. The unit used an active learning approach focusing on guided inquiry, open inquiry, and discussion of impacts of INA on different disciplines. In the guided inquiry portion of the lesson, small groups of students conducted an INA assay to test ten known abiotic and biotic samples for ice nucleation activity. In the open inquiry part of the lesson, students collected environmental samples and tested them for INA.</p>\n<p>To identify important gaps in our knowledge of ice nucleation processes and their impacts, two international workshops were held in Vienna, Austria in 2015 and 2016. The following research needs were identified: (1) uncovering the molecular identity of active sites for ice nucleation; (2) the importance of modeling for the understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation; (3) identifying and quantifying contributions of biological ice nuclei from natural and managed environments; (4) examining the role of aging in ice nuclei; (5) conducting targeted sampling campaigns in clouds; and (6) designing lab and field experiments to increase our understanding of the role of ice-nucleating particles in the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/04/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Boris&nbsp;A&nbsp;Vinatzer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1241068/1241068_10204137_1503953761372_Kentland_Rain_Sampling_SiteB--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1241068/1241068_10204137_1503953761372_Kentland_Rain_Sampling_SiteB--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rain sampling site B\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1241068/1241068_10204137_1503953761372_Kentland_Rain_Sampling_SiteB--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rain sampling site B\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Rain sampling site at Virginia Tech's Kentland Farm.
