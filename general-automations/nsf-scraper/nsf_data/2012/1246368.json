 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Purnendu Dasgupta of the University of Texas at Arlington and his graduate student researchers will be supported to develop broadband multipath spectrometry using cavities with diffuse but high reflectivity.  The key feature of the devices that will be developed is an increase in the effective path-length for absorption achieved by having the light pass through the sample multiple times.  In comparison to other multi-path optical methods, the method being developed by Prof. Dasgupta and his students is not reliant upon optically flat surfaces.   \r\n\r\nSpectrometry is a workhorse method for quantitatively measuring the concentration of species in solution.  It fails when the analytes of interest are weakly absorbing, when the pathlength through the sample is small, or when the concentration of the absorbing species is very low.  Methods like that being developed in this project aim to overcome these problems, thereby increasing the utility of this robust analytical method.  The technique being developed in this project can be useful in a number of important applications, including the determination of low levels of contaminants in ultra-high purity water.  The students working on this project will gain useful experience in building new kinds of analytical instruments, and they will be well-trained for employment in the science and technology workforce.",

The mirrors are not perfect reflectors but have a very small transmittance.  So a small portion of the beam incident on the entrance mirror goes into the cell, proceeds through the measurement medium of interest (and is attenuated by light absorption) and falls on the distal mirror.  While most of the light is reflected back, a small amount leaks through this mirror to the detector that is placed immediately behind it.  The reflected light proceeds through the medium again, undergoing the attenuation by the medium and is again reflected by the entrance mirror and the process continues for ever.  The reader will appreciate that when the solution is highly absorbing, very little light is left will remain after the first pass, so what happens after the first pass becomes less important whereas when the extent of light absorption is small, much light is left over to bounce back and forth and significant contributions to the total light registered by the detector is made by subsequent passes.  Effectively therefore the effective length of the path the light travels when the solution is highly absorbing is only equal to that of the first pass while many passes count when the solution has relatively low absorbance, making it possible to measure such low absorbance values easier.
