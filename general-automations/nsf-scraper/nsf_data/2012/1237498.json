 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the operations of the Social Observatories Coordinating Network (SOCN), a research coordination network that will work with a broad cross-section of scholars in the social, behavioral, and economic (SBE) scientific communities in the development and planning of a set of observatories that will transform SBE science.  The major objectives of the network are to continue exploration of ideas regarding the potential form and functioning of a network of social observatories and to actively engage individuals and groups across the SBE research community in this process.  SOCN will work with disciplinary and interdisciplinary groups to ensure that they contribute to the design of these proposed observatories and that the scientific questions the observatories might pursue will have value for basic research and for a broad range of practical uses.  SOCN will widely dissemination reports and other findings, and it will facilitate interactions among scholars, particularly at national professional meetings and other scientific conferences.\r\n\r\nThe network will facilitate the consideration and development of what is expected to be a transformative set of observatories that would provide a new platform for data collection, data archiving, and data distribution; advanced cyberinfrastructure for a truly interdisciplinary SBE scientific enterprise; new approaches to training of students; and a focal point for synthesis and faculty collaboration around questions of national importance.  A coordinated suite of social observatories is expected to add new capabilities for SBE sciences by moving to fine-grained and place-based studies that address local, regional, and national concerns.  The observatories will advance understanding of individual decision making via experiments, ethnography, spatially explicit data, administrative, and social media data that, when combined over all sites, will be nationally representative.  Through its efforts to facilitate consideration of social observatories, SOCN will advance the discussion of critical new ideas and advance interdisciplinary communication and collaboration across the SBE sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nObjectives\n\nThe major objectives of the Social Observatories Coordinating Network (SOCN) were to explore ideas regarding the potential form and functioning of a new form of infrastructure for research - a network of regional data centers - and to actively engage individuals and groups across the social, behavioral, and economic research community in this process.\n\n \n\nOutcomes\n\nThere are four major take-away messages gained from this project:\n\nBehavior is so situation-      and place-specific that it is practically impossible to use widely      dispersed national samples of populations to draw conclusions about      processes in any one place.  Populations      tend to be clustered spatially by social, economic, and demographic characteristics.  This has implications for important      issues of national concern, such as adaptation to environmental change and      social mobility.  Social policy,      economic conditions, race/ethnic/immigrant composition, and the size of      the middle class in a city provide a context in which individuals can      thrive or stagnate, leading to important questions about the roles of      government, nonprofits, and for-profit organizations in fostering      opportunity and mobility processes, and the impact of their policies on      individuals, families, and neighborhoods. \nThe network considered a      new national framework or platform that is both scalable and flexible for      addressing these new challenges, one that allows for rapid response to      local crises such as the devastating impact of tornadoes and hurricanes or      social unrest, and those provoked by prolonged regional drought or      economic decline.

Each center would collect, organize, create, and      disseminate data. These regional data centers or \"social observatories\"      would follow about 400 census tracts over time and space from twenty to      twenty-five regions across the country. Working closely with local and      state governments, they would access administrative data with information      on not just a sample of the population of those several hundred census      tracts, but complete records on all the population in those tracts (i.e.,      circa two million Americans).

Our vision is that,      collectively, they would offer a nationally representative sample, one      that was highly clustered so as to capture local context and variability.\nLinking diverse forms of      data, including administrative and social media data, represents the most      efficient way to obtain more place-specific information in our current social      science data bases.  This is the      focus of our edited volume (669) of the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, January      2017.  Probably the most important,      least well-addressed, and most difficult issue raised was privacy and confidentiality      in the handling of individual data.       This is an area recommended for future NSF initiatives.  \n\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe observatory network explicitly responded to what is now a broad call in many scientific circles to address issues of importance with the best tools available without regard for disciplinary origins. We expect this project to have broad impact on thinking regarding research and data collection in multiple fields of scientific inquiry.  The proposed new scientific infrastructure will enable the social, behavioral, and economic sciences (SBE) to contribute to societal needs at multiple levels and will facilitate collaboration with other sciences in addressing questions of critical importance.
