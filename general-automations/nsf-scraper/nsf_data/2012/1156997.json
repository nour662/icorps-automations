This program provides an opportunity for undergraduates to take part in real research and to become deeply involved in a particular research field. Support is offered for twelve students per year for ten weeks of summer research.   Fields represented by the potential mentors are: laser physics including work with the Jefferson Lab FEL, laser atom interactions, condensed matter physics studied with lasers, NMR, and a variety of other techniques, neutrino physics, nuclear and particle physics, THz spectroscopy,  polymer physics, surface physics, ultra-sonics, non-destructive evaluation, BEC on a chip, ultrashort laser pulses, plasma physics, non-linear dynamics, quantum computing, information and optics, bio-informatics,and astrophysics/cosmology. The presentation skills learned (abstract preparation, short paper presentation, long paper preparation and presentation) are skills useful throughout productive careers.",
