 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study spatially localized structures in driven dissipative systems. Such structures are characterized by a balance between energy input through suitable forcing and energy dissipation within the structure, and are common in many physical systems including fluids, nonlinear optics and reaction-diffusion equations. This proposal seeks to extend existing understanding of these structures to two and three spatial dimensions through mathematical analysis of global bifurcations in spatially reversible systems together with numerical continuation techniques. Systems with both variational and nonvariational structure will be studied, with a focus on understanding the growth and multiplicity of stationary or moving structures as parameters are varied.  Time-dependent localized structures will be studied through analysis of the bulk state and the motion of the front or boundary that confines it.  Collisions between moving structures and their trapping by external inhomogeneities will be investigated by direct numerical simulation. The results will be applied to several systems exhibiting thermally driven motion including binary fluid convection, doubly diffusive convection and rotating convection.\r\n\r\nSpatially localized structures are common in physical systems. Familiar examples in fluids include localized convection, vortices, liquid drops and solitary waves. Additional examples are provided by spots in optical and chemical systems, localized buckling of slender structures under compression, pulses propagating along neural fibers and localized oscillations in vibrating granular media. Although these examples reach across many areas of the physical sciences the localized structures that appear have many properties in common. This proposal seeks to develop a mathematical understanding of the origin and properties of such structures focusing on changes that take place as the parameters of the system change, and aims to identify the properties that are shared by these different examples.",

Systems described by partial differential equations were studied and the theory developed, including numerical continuation based on spectral elements, was applied to several important systems arising in hydrodynamics: (i) convection in a horizontal layer rotating about the vertical, (ii) convection in an imposed magnetic field and (iii) doubly diffusive convection driven by disparities between the diffusion rates of heat and salt that arises in oceanographic applications. In general stationary localized structures in systems of this type are organized in several intertwined solution branches within a parameter region called the snaking region, and this is so in both one, two and three dimensions. The PI and colleagues discovered, however, that the detailed properties of the snaking branches depend on the absence or presence of a conserved quantity. In (i) this quantity is the zonal momentum while in (ii) it is the magnetic flux across the layer that is conserved. These results were confirmed in a detailed study of a model problem, the so-called conserved Swift-Hohenberg equation, that models the growth of a crystalline solid from a supercooled melt. In particular we find that localized structures in conserved systems exhibit slanted snaking and that such structures are present both in the subcritical and supercritical regimes, the former referring to the case in which the melt and crystal coexist stably, and the latter to the case where the melt is already unstable.</p>\n<p>The PI has used this and more sophisticated models to study the properties of crystallization fronts whereby the crystalline state invades the supercooled liquid.

The PI has studied the question whether over time the defects will heal or whether the disorder remains frozen into the crystal.
