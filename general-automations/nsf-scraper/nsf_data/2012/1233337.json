 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will utilize dynamic programming to develop approaches for solving problems where\r\nsequentially arriving jobs can either be rejected or assigned to a currently unassigned worker. In\r\nthe general model the resulting reward from an assignment will be determined by an arbitrary\r\nfunction that depends on both the characteristics of the job and the worker. Particular cases,\r\nsuch as where the reward is binary, yielding a reward of 1 when a job is assigned to a qualified\r\nworker, will be considered. Models where the problem ends when each worker has been assigned\r\nand ones where workers return for reassignment after a random time will be considered. In the\r\ncase of returning workers, probability distributions for the time it takes each worker to complete\r\na job are assumed, and problems will be analyzed both when these distributions are assumed\r\nknown and when they are unknown. Results will determine optimal policies when possible, good\r\nheuristic policies otherwise. Simulation techniques, using innovative variance reduction ideas,\r\nwill be used to analyze the performance of policies. The project will will yield important insights\r\nas to how to solve and approximate dynamic programming problems having multidimensional\r\nstate spaces.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the research will impact many important application areas. For examples, in health care, workers might be patients waiting for organ transplants, and jobs could be arriving organs. The model is also equivalent to one that\r\nassumes that an organization has jobs to fill, with each sequentially arriving job seeker having\r\na vector giving the values to the organization of assigning that candidate to the different jobs.\r\n",
