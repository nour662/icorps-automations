 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies involving electron-flavor neutrinos have raised many interesting questions. For example, is there electron-neutrino appearance at short baseline? What is the magnitude of the missing mixing matrix parameter, associated with the electron-flavor? And is there CP violation in the light neutrino sector, which is explored through electron-neutrino appearance? These questions are identified as top priority in advancing knowledge within the neutrino physics field.\r\n\r\nThis award provides support for students and postdocs on a series of neutrino experiments chosen to be phased in time: MiniBooNE, SciBooNE, Double Chooz, MicroBooNE and DAEDALUS. These experiments are selected to have intellectual coherence and to allow the students and postdocs in the group to experience all stages of experimental work within their careers at MIT. MIT has a central role in the MiniBooNE oscillation analysis and in developing associated phenomenological models involving sterile neutrinos. The MiniBooNE results have excited interest in next generation short-baseline experiments, including the MicroBooNE experiment that will address the MiniBooNE event excesses with state-of-the-art liquid argon technology. MIT is responsible for delivering the light collection system on MicroBooNE and for R&D on the first lightguide-based detection system for future large LAr detectors. The group plays a leading role in the US-based analysis of the last neutrino mixing angle from the Double Chooz data. MIT has specialized in monitoring on Double Chooz and this award provides support for a novel directional neutron monitor, DCTPC, which will be constructed in this grant period. DAEDALUS, with its multiple beams and single detector, is an example of how the MIT group develops transformative ideas. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The PI is dedicated to expanding participation of women and minorities in STEM, as well as improving STEM education and teacher development. The group is involved in numerous projects to increase public scientific literacy and gives many public talks, communicating the excitement of neutrino physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Conrad Group at MIT, supported by grant NSF-PHY-1205175, pursues  research in neutrino physics.  Our main focus is on Beyond Standard  Model searches, especially as evidenced by oscillations involving  electron neutrinos.  We participate in both direct searches and in  development and measurements which support those searches.\n\nOur activities have been divided among several experiments and specialized  measurements.   The experiments are:  MiniBooNE (completed), Double  Chooz (completed participation), IceCube (Ongoing),  MicroBooNE (will run in fall, 2015) and IsoDAR (future) and  DAEdALUS-CP (future).       The latter two are phases of the same  overarching DAEdALUS program.     The top priority of each experiment  falls into one of two categories: 1) understanding the evolving  three-neutrino model, so that we can do precision tests in the future  and 2) searching for new physics beyond the evolving three-neutrino  model. However,  it should be recognized that each experiment explores  physics in both categories.     We have also been involved in several  specialized measurements.    The DCTPC studies (complete), which are  fully funded by NSF-PHY-1205175, provide fast neutron measurements for   Double Chooz, MicroBooNE, and  for general use in neutrino and dark  matter simulations.   The Best studies (complete)  are cyclotron  central region tests associated with the DAEdALUS program, with  equipment and travel funded through the MIT EAGER award,  NSF-PHY-1148134, and MIT scientists funded through NSF-PHY-1205175.   In  all cases, our contributions to the science have included detector  development and construction, data analysis, and phenomenology.\n\nThe outcomes of our work are reported in 35 papers to which we provided unique and essential contributions.     One of these papers now has more than 500 citations.   We also contributed to 9 other experimental papers, 3 summaries, and many whitepapers and proposals.  Very importantly, we have contributed to increasing the STEM workforce by graduating 4 Ph.D.'s during the time period of this grant.\n\nOur work has many creative and transformational aspects:\n\nAward-winning (IUPAP Young Scientist Prize and Primakoff Award) contributions to Lorentz violation studies have set limits at the Planck scale using MiniBooNE and Double Chooz data.\nLeadership in sterile neutrino studies and fits. The importance of the MIT Group's global fits was highlighted at Neutrino 2014 and our first paper on published in 2002, now has 250 citations.
