 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to further develop a general and effective, fully relativistic computer code for electron and photon interactions with atoms, ions, and molecules using the B-spline R-matrix (BSR) method.   This innovative approach has significant advantages over the standard suite of R-matrix codes, mostly developed over the past four decades in Belfast and currently used worldwide.   Specifically, the excellent numerical properties of a B-spline basis allow for high computational accuracy, and the ability to employ non-orthogonal sets of term-dependent orbitals allows for compact configuration expansions.   During the current funding period, the existing computer code will be fully parallelized, and a new suite of general atomic structure codes will be developed, which directly use the B-spline as an improved interface to the BSR collision codes.   Furthermore, a parallelized B-spline code to solve the close-coupling equations in the outer region will be developed, and a pilot version of the BSR program to treat time-dependent processes, such as intense short-pulse XUV laser-atom interactions, will be extended to double ionization and infrared radiation.  Finally, the potential use of the BSR method to describe electron and photon interactions with diatomic molecules will be investigated.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the project consists of the further development of a highly successful suite of computer programs to calculate accurate atomic data for a wide variety of electron- and photon-driven processes.  The production calculations will focus on atomic targets, for which these data are of critical value to model the physics and chemistry of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas, lasers, and planetary atmospheres.  This work will support many experimental projects ranging from industrial lighting systems to fundamental research performed at next-generation synchrotrons and free-electron lasers.  The results will be presented at international scientific meetings, and the next version of the computer code will be written up and made available to the public.  Finally, undergraduate students will be trained through developing and testing individual modules of the package.  This includes running the code on massively parallel computing platforms provided through XSEDE resources.",

When discrepancies remained, there were several occasions where problems with the evaluation and interpretation of the experimental data were discovered &ndash; rather than problems with our theory.  In other situations, we noticed that even more elaborate calculations than we could perform at the time would need to be carried out to properly simulate all the important physical processes that were affecting the outcome of a particular collision process.  Consequently, we continue to work on further improvements of both the general algorithms and their implementation on supercomputer platforms.\n\nBroader Impact: As tangible results of our work, we provided extensive cross-section datasets to many users who are interested in plasma modeling.  These cross sections are now available to the general public through various databases.  The close interactions between data producers (like ourselves), experimentalists who perform basic research in atomic collisions, and data users all over the world in academic institutions, national laboratories, and industry, have been true highlights of the present project.\n\nWe published about 50 papers and several book contributions during this project, and we also presented our results through invited and contributed talks at international scientific conferences and colloquia at other institutions, both in the US and abroad.
