 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a two-dimensional, fully electromagnetic hybrid code (ions treated using particle-in-cell method and electrons treated as a fluid) to investigate the propagation, evolution and distribution of oblique whistler chorus waves in the magnetosphere.  The simulations will be carried out in a realistic dipole magnetic field geometry.  The project will test existing theories of these waves and will explore new generation mechanisms.  The simulations will yield information on the distribution of such waves with respect to both space and frequency.  The scientific questions to be investigated include the distribution of the waves in space, in frequency, and the wave polarization.  In additional the project will determine whether or not variations in the cold plasma density can explain the rapid initiation of the waves and how such variations affect the propagation of wave energy along magnetic field lines.  Finally the project will examine how the large oblique whistler waves may accelerate electrons to high energies in the radiation belts.\r\n\r\nRecent observations have shown that large amplitude whistler chorus waves often propagate at a large angle relative to the terrestrial magnetic field.  This makes the common assumption of propagation parallel to the magnetic field invalid.  The generation mechanism that leads to such waves is still undetermined.  The simulations that will be done by this project will improve our understanding of how such waves affect the electrons in the radiation belts.  Understanding the radiation belts is an important topic in space weather.  Most of the funding for this project will support research conducted by a female graduate student.",
