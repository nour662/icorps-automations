 "awd_abstract_narration": "To maintain a robust innovation system, it is important to make full use of qualified personnel, and to create products that are matched to potential users. In the US, women are under-represented in the science and technology labor force, and innovation systems do not always address the ways that gender and technology intersect. As a result, there are bottlenecks in the innovation system. This award addresses those two problems by building on a European Union policy directive that requires attention to gender in innovation.  The award funds the development of cases in which attention to gender led to important technological innovations. These cases are refined and tested by an interdisciplinary group of researchers from natural and physical science, engineering, social science, and humanities. This research contributes to theories of how gender shapes scientific knowledge. While previous policy interventions sought to increase women?s human capital, or to redress institutional problems, this research will examine how attention to gendered knowledge can make science and technology work attractive to women, and also contribute to innovation.  \r\n\r\nCase materials are visually and technically documented, and made available to policymakers, practicing scientists and engineers, and teachers through an interactive website, publications, and policy documents. The creation and testing of the materials will geographically and demographically diverse researchers, undergraduate researchers, and students.",

The methods of sex and gender analysis are one set of methods among many that a researcher will bring to a project.\n\n Three Strategic Approaches\n\nGovernments and universities have taken three strategic approaches to gender equality over the past several decades:\n\n1. \"Fix the Numbers of Women\" focuses on increasing women's participation.\n\n2. \"Fix the Institutions\" promotes gender equality in careers through structural change in research organizations.\n\n3. \"Fix the Knowledge\" or \"gendered innovations\" or the \"gender dimension\" stimulates excellence in science and technology by integrating sex and gender analysis into research.\n\n Gendered Innovations:\n\n? Add value to research and engineering by ensuring excellence and quality in outcomes and enhancing sustainability.\n ? Add value to society by making research more responsive to social needs. \n ? Add value to business by developing new ideas, patents, and technology.\n\nGendered Innovations stimulate gender-responsible science and technology, thereby enhancing the quality of life for both women and men worldwide. \n\nProject Background\n\nThe current Gendered Innovations project was initiated at Stanford University, July 2009. In January 2011 the European Commission set up an expert group, \"Innovation through Gender,\" aimed at developing the gender dimension in EU research and innovation.
