 "awd_abstract_narration": "Though many children use mobile applications to support their learning and entertainment, the devices and underlying interactions were not designed specifically for children. The goal of this project is to make touch and gesture interactions more accessible and user-friendly to young users. This research will yield new understanding about the appropriate and successful ways to sense, recognize, and recover from errors in touch-based interactions with children. The approach involves studying children interacting with mobile applications that gather data on their touch and gesture interactions, as well as conducting design sessions with children to elicit their preferences for mobile device interactions and error feedback and recovery strategies. This approach will result in design guidelines for those creating applications and tools for young users. The proposed research contributes towards the evolution of alternative interaction technologies such as touch and gesture, and the understanding of child-computer interaction with new gesture-based technologies. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The broader impacts of this project lie in contributions towards the evolution of alternative interaction technologies such as touch and gesture, and the understanding of child-computer interaction with new gesture-based technologies. This work also will develop and validate an approach for investigating such interaction issues and designing improvements for them that can be used in future work with other populations such as older individuals or those with varying physical abilities.  The grant will support two female young investigators, and will fund research experiences to benefit computer science students attending Bowie State University, a minority serving institution.",

For example, mobile devices are now the most popular gaming device for children, ages 2-17. As human computer interaction researchers our interest is in exploring usage patterns of children and understanding how software can be designed to improve the accessibility and success of young children using touch screen devices. This project was initiated to investigate the ways in which young children use mobile devices and provide mobile application and interaction designers with empirical findings that can be extended in their work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In total we conducted user studies with over 70 adults and children and collected over 28,000 touch events and 21,000 gestures. The first study conducted was designed to compare the usage between adults, (ages 18-33) and children (ages 5-17) use touch and gesture interaction on simple apps focusing on isolated interactions. The second study involved the use of an app that used contextualized interactions and allowed for further examination of children&rsquo;s interactions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Though mobile device platforms respond quickly to users&rsquo; touches, prior work has shown that users sometimes experience unintended behaviors. One of our key research results indicate that a reliable subset of touch events are actually intended for a target no longer onscreen (e.g., due to the child user perhaps not noticing the intended target has already been activated). We refer to these touches as <em>holdovers:</em> meaning touches that are located within the vicinity of the preceding target. As users of mobile devices ourselves, we have experienced <em>holdovers</em> in real tasks: touchscreen devices may be slow to register a touch and so we touch again intentionally in the same location, but the interface has already moved on, causing unintentional effects. Though experienced by users of all ages, we have found that holdovers are most prevalent among young users and occur with very small targets. We have also found that holdovers are distributed equally over the entire screen, suggesting that handedness and occlusion are not contributing factors. This key finding is an example of an interaction challenge and our findings can be useful for touchscreen application developers aiming to reduce unintended interactions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The research results of these activities have been shared with the public though journal publications, conference presentations, and events on Bowie State University&rsquo;s campus. &nbsp;The design interactions in the published papers codify the empirical findings into actionable interface and interaction design strategies.&nbsp; These strategies can improve the accessibility and success of young children using touch screen devices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this project at Bowie State University include the training and mentorship of six African American students (2 graduate female, 3 undergraduate female, and 1 undergraduate male) with exposure to research methods and training, including IRB applications, human computer interaction research, child computer interaction, and mobile application development. The students also participated in professional development activities including attending conference and presenting research findings.&nbsp; Students involved in the project are now in various career stages including one post-doctoral researcher and one consultant for a large tech company designing mobile applications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/12/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Velma&nbsp;Latson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1218664/1218664_10208600_1484252043324_gesture-a--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1218664/1218664_10208600_1484252043324_gesture-a--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Touch - a\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1218664/1218664_10208600_1484252043324_gesture-a--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Touch - a\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Hand over attempt to touch target</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dr. Quincy Brown & Dr. Lisa Anthony</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Velma&nbsp;Latson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Touch - a</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1218664/1218664_10208600_1484252100240_gesture-b--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1218664/1218664_10208600_1484252100240_gesture-b--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Touch - b\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1218664/1218664_10208600_1484252100240_gesture-b--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Touch - b\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Hand over after the interface has moved the target to new location</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dr. Quincy Brown & Dr. Lisa Anthony</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Velma&nbsp;Latson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Touch - b</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1218664/1218664_10208600_1484252219173_scatterplot-a--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1218664/1218664_10208600_1484252219173_scatterplot-a--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Scatterplot-a\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1218664/1218664_10208600_1484252219173_scatterplot-a--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Scatterplot-a\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Holdovers, from targets (a)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dr. Quincy Brown & Dr. Lisa Anthony</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Velma&nbsp;Latson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Scatterplot-a</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1218664/1218664_10208600_1484252290865_scatterplot-b--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1218664/1218664_10208600_1484252290865_scatterplot-b--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Scatterplot-b\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1218664/1218664_10208600_1484252290865_scatterplot-b--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Scatterplot-b\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Holdovers, from targets (b)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dr. Quincy Brown & Dr. Lisa Anthony</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Velma&nbsp;Latson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Scatterplot-b</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
