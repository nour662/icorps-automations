 "awd_abstract_narration": "The existence of dark matter is known from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility motivated by other considerations in elementary particle physics is that dark matter consists of undiscovered elementary particles; Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are one possibility. Evidence for WIMPs that could constitute dark matter may come from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN or from sensitive astronomical instruments that detect radiation produced by WIMP-WIMP annihilations in galaxy halos. The orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nuclear collisions of sufficient energy to be observable by sensitive laboratory apparatus. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide funding for research and development steps to support DarkSide-G2, a second-generation (\"G2\") direct WIMP search using a liquid argon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with an active mass of 3.3 tons. Liquid argon is a promising medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (\"pulse shape\") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. This is one of the most powerful background rejection factors among all dark matter detectors, and when combined with the measurement of ionization, background rejection is even further enhanced. The performance of a ton-scale or larger liquid argon TPC would be limited by the high rate of 39-Ar beta decays if atmospheric argon was used. DarkSide-G2 will use argon collected from underground sources which has been shown to have 39-Ar content lower than atmospheric argon by at least a factor of 150. These funds will allow the groups to carry out the detailed mechanical design work necessary to ensure the functionality of the detector, develop necessary high voltage and data acquisition elements, and develop and identify the extremely radiopure detector components and techniques necessary to maximize the sensitivity of the experiment.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission in a variety of ways: (1) it will offer a continuing opportunity for the training of students, who will have a chance to contribute a cutting-edge project in fundamental science and advanced engineering; (2) it will benefit society by developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging; and (3) it will support continued development of successful E&O programs such as the LNGS-South Dakota-Princeton summer school for high school students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDark Matter was first suggested in the 1930\u00c6s based on studying clusters of galaxies and later confirmed by studies of stars inside galaxies.  Evidence for the existence of dark matter is mown compelling, but its nature remains a fundamental mystery.  Particularly intriguing is the possibility that dark matter is made of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs).  WIMPs may be directly detected by their collisions with nuclei on Earth, the but low expected rate of collisions and the low energy of the recoil requires very large detectors with extremely low background rates. \n\nThe DarkSide program uses liquid argon as the medium for WIMP detection.  In this project we\u00c6ve constructed a detector to house about 50 kg of liquid argon underground in the LNGS laboratory in Italy.  Argon was chosen because of its ability to separate nuclear recoil events from events induced by beta and gamma interactions.  There are a few elements of the DarkSide program that are novel 1) we are going to use extremely low radioactivity photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), 2) we are going to use argon that was extracted from an underground well, and 3) we are going to use active shields.  PMT\u00c6s can form a dominant background, and the collaboration is actively working with a manufacturer to produce new lower radioactive PMTs.  Argon is exceptionally good as a medium to detect WIMPs, however normal argon contains 39Ar which is a radioactive element that acts as an internal background.  The underground argon we have found has at least a factor of 200 less 39Ar. The active shielding will allow us to identify backgrounds when they interact in the shields so that we can veto events at the same time in the detector. \n\nThe DarkSide detector is currently operating with less than ideal PMTs because the lower radioactivity ones were not stable, and we are taking data with normal above ground argon.  This allows us to take a \"background rich\" data sample over the course of weeks or months with more background then we\u00c6d expect in a multi-year sample. This sample can test our techniques for removing those backgrounds.  This sample also uses our active shielding and allows us to calibrate the detector with radioactive sources.  Then in fall we will redeploy the detector with the underground argon and begin taking physics quality data. \n\nThis grant has supported Augustana College\u00c6s participation in DarkSide.  It has supported many undergraduates and given them real experience working on cutting edge physics.  Augustana students have participated in operations of the detector, simulations studies, and studies of the underground argon.   The most recent work has focused on creating an on campus PMT test stand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew K Alton"
