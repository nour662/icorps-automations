Gravitational wave bursts are short signals with the potential of unveiling the broadest range of sources of gravitational radiation: e.g. stellar core collapse, gamma-ray bursts engines, cosmic strings, compact object mergers, isolated neutron stars. The perfect storm of observations of short duration cataclysmic events is arriving with gravitational antennas such as LIGO. Now is the time to challenge the theoretical understanding of the transient gravitational wave sky and its connection to the more traditional electromagnetic firmament. The time is also ripe for a workshop that enables critical review of the data analysis and numerical modeling tools that will make gravitational-wave observations a reality.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will encourage communication and critical evaluation of efforts and methodologies, in an environment that promotes synergistic collaborations among researchers from the astrophysics, data analysis and numerical relativity communities. The meeting will serve as a model for inter-disciplinary workshops in gravitational-wave physics, providing an example of a collaborative framework to evaluate the status of the effort in a multi-disciplinary area, assess methodologies and challenges, and identify transformative opportunities.",
