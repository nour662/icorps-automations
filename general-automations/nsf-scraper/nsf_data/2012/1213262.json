 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program of the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Charles Clapp, from Bucknell University, will use chemical synthesis and site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the binding of substrates to the enzyme soybean lipoxygenase-1, with a focus on the role of phenylalanine-557 (phe-557), which has been proposed to be at the binding site for the methyl terminus of substrates.  This hypothesis will be tested by synthesizing fatty acids that are slightly longer than linoleic acid and determining whether these new substrates show enhanced activity with site-directed mutants in which phe-557 is replaced with smaller amino acids.  It has also been proposed that replacing phe-557 with smaller amino acids alters the regiochemistry of the reaction by allowing substrates to bind in a reverse manner.  This hypothesis will be tested using synthetic substrates, stereochemical studies, and additional mutagenesis.\r\n\r\nLipoxygenases catalyze a useful reaction, the incorporation of oxygen into polyunsaturated fatty acids, that chemists cannot carry out in a controlled way without enzymes.  Understanding the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes provides an opportunity to learn useful chemistry from nature.  Soybean lipoxygenase-1 is the most extensively studied lipoxygenase, but our mechanistic insight is limited by uncertainty about how substrates bind. The proposed work is designed to address this deficiency.  Better understanding of how lipoxygenases bind substrates could lead to the rational design of mutant lipoxygenases that would catalyze transformations that cannot be achieved with the natural enzymes.  Undergraduate students will play a major role in this work.  The proposed experiments use basic techniques that students learn about in their courses, and students working on this project will gain experience applying these techniques to test hypotheses in research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSoybean lipoxygenase-1 (SBLO-1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of oxygen into polyunsaturated fatty acids.  This is a reaction that chemists cannot carry out in a controlled way in the absence of enzymes.  The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of how SBLO-1 binds fatty acids and how this enzyme controls the position of oxygen insertion into the fatty acid.  For example, when SBLO-1 incorporates oxygen into linoleic acid, which has 18 carbons, why does nearly all of the oxygen (96%) become attached to carbon 13?\n\nOur initial working hypothesis was that the polar end of fatty binds near the surface of the enzyme and the nonpolar end binds in the interior, near phenylalanine-557.  To test this hypothesis we synthesized two new fatty acids that are slightly longer than linoleic acid, the normal substrate for the enzyme.  These two new synthetic substrates have 19 and 20 carbons.  We have found that SBLO-1 oxygenates these longer fatty acids much more slowly than it oxygenates linoleic acid, and the ability of SBLO-1 to control the position at which oxygen was inserted was greatly impeded.  These results are consistent with our expectation that the longer fatty acids would be too long to fit properly into the binding site.  We have also tested these fatty acids with a modified form of SBLO-1 that we have prepared in which phenylalanine-557 was replaced with alanine, a smaller residue.  This modified form is referred to as the phe557ala mutant.  Our expectation was that the longer fatty acids would show higher activity with the phe557ala mutant, since the smaller alanine residue would provide space for the end of the longer fatty acids to bind.  This expected rate enhancement was not observed, but the phe557 ala mutant did show improved ability to control the position at which oxygen was inserted into the longer fatty acids.\n\nWe also have found that replacing phenylalanine-557 with valine causes SBLO-1 to insert 30-40 % of the oxygen at carbon 9 of linoleic acid rather than carbon 13.  We have carried out a variety of experiments with linoleic acid and other substrates to determine the reason for this, and the results strongly suggest that the oxygenation at carbon 9 results from \"reverse binding\" &ndash; that is, the nonpolar end of linoleic acid binds near the surface of the enzyme and the polar end binds in the interior. \n\nBroader impacts of this research involved the participation of eight undergraduate students.  Five of these students have now graduated.  Of these graduates, one is pursuing studies towards a Ph.D. in biological chemistry, one is working as a research associate for a pharmaceutical company, one is working as a lab technician for a biotech company, and two are in medical school.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles H Clapp"
