 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Nessan J. Kerrigan of the Department of Chemistry at Oakland University will explore the development of the catalytic asymmetric ketene heterodimerization reaction and its applications.  While catalytic homodimerizations of ketenes have received some attention over the last twenty years, ketene heterodimerization has remained a very underdeveloped reaction, despite its great potential.  Problems associated with the thermal ketene heterodimerization reaction include poor ketene heterodimer regioselectivity, competing ketene homodimerization, low ketene heterodimer yields, and absence of asymmetric variants. Professor Kerrigan's group will investigate a stepwise mechanistic approach, promoted by a chiral alkaloid organocatalyst under mild conditions, rather than a (concerted) thermal cycloaddition approach, in order to facilitate a regioselective and enantioselective heterodimerization reaction.  Some applications of the methodology toward the synthesis of biologically active molecules will be investigated and aldol reactions of ketene heterodimer-derived metal enolates will also be evaluated.  \r\n\t\t\r\nThis work could lead to more efficient and flexible access to building blocks useful for the preparation of an array of structurally complex and biologically active molecules.  Such chemistry will contribute to green synthesis as the proposed ketene heterodimerization methodology avoids the use of metal catalysts.  Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, as it will provide ready and inexpensive access to a number of desirable building blocks for complex molecule construction.  This project will provide excellent training of students, ranging from undergraduate to post-doctoral levels, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit:\n\nThe supported work has led to the development of new methods for the synthesis of small molecules with potential to act as building blocks for biologically active molecules, with relevance to tuberculosis and cancer.  The work has facilitated the development of a new method for the synthesis of small molecules, termed ketene heterodimers. The ketene heterodimers, available in two forms, a left-handed form and a right-handed form, were formed preferentially as a single-handed form through the influence of a nitrogen-centered alkaloid catalytic system.  The ketene heterodimers, formed as a single-handed form, were then converted into useful building blocks for the synthesis of complex molecules (natural products and drug molecules).  Particularly interesting findings were that ketene heterodimers could be transformed into deoxypropionate derivative molecules (potential building blocks for tuberculosis metabolites), dipropionate derivative molecules (building blocks for many anticancer polypropionates) and 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds (intermediates for cinnabaramide A and salinosporamide A, molecules with anticancer potential).  New directions involving ketene chemistry were also explored, for example, the synthesis of &gamma;-lactones from sulfoxonium ylides, aldehydes, and ketenes, and the synthesis of &beta;-lactones from ketenes and chiral aldehydes.\n\nThe supported work has led to twelve publications in peer-reviewed journals (2013-2016), with the highlights being three papers in Organic Letters and four papers in the Journal of Organic Chemistry.  Seven of our twelve publications during this time had undergraduate co-authors, with ten undergraduate co-authors in all.  The results of the work have also been disseminated as oral and poster presentations by students and the PI at multiple conferences, including the 251st National Meeting of the American Chemical Society (San Diego, March 13, 2016), 252nd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society (Philadelphia, August 21, 2016), 247th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society (Dallas, March 16, 2014), and the 47th Central Regional Meeting of the American Chemical Society (Covington, May 18-21, 2016). \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThe PI?s group over the grant period (2012-2016) has consisted of two Ph.D. students, three postdoctoral research associates, and fifteen undergraduate student researchers.  Graduate students who have worked on this project have learned a number of important advanced laboratory techniques in pursuing the goals of the project.  They have learned to appreciate reaction development from a mechanistic point of view, and to set up reactions that test mechanistic proposals. Graduate students have gained experience at characterizing compounds, preparing supporting information documents for peer-reviewed publications, and generally learning about the process by which manuscripts are prepared and submitted to journals for peer review.  In addition, graduate students have taken advantage of the opportunity to gain valuable teaching experience through instruction of undergraduates in the research laboratory.  Graduate students have also developed their presentation skills through regular group and joint group meetings in the Department of Chemistry.  Undergraduates have been fully exposed to the scientific culture of a productive research laboratory.  Since summer 2012, the PI?s group has had fifteen undergraduate students involved in the group?s research, with four involved since Fall 2015.  Oakland University has provided a formal structured Summer Undergraduate Research Program for the last 15 years.  The PI?s group has participated fully in this program with four undergraduate members of our group involved during the summers of 2015 and 2016.  The benefits to the undergraduate students are considerable.  They are involved in a genuine research program (40-45 hours laboratory work per week for undergraduates) and they also have opportunities to hone their presentation skills.  In the PI?s laboratory, undergraduate students learn advanced synthetic techniques, modern purification methods, and advanced analytical methods. \n\nUndergraduate students who participated in this work have gone on to attend Medical School at the University of Michigan, Ohio University, Wayne State University, and Michigan State University, as well as Graduate School at the University of Utah.  Another three undergraduate students have embarked upon careers in the chemical industry (e.g., two at BASF).  One graduate student has graduated with a Ph.D. and is now a postdoctoral research associate at Saint Louis University.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nessan Kerrigan"
