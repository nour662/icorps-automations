Emulsions, bubbles and foams are multiphase systems that have a broad range of applications in biomedicine, food, cosmetics, pharmaceutics, and renewable energy. The objective of the symposium is to bring together scientists and engineers studying these systems from both fundamentals and applications points of view. These systems are complex in nature; thus, development of new products based on these materials could significantly benefit from fundamental understanding and insights.  The NSF support will be used towards the travel costs of participants from academia and industry. The program theme of the 245th ACS National Meeting is Chemistry of Energy and Food, making this meeting particularly well suited to host the proposed symposium.\r\n\r\nEmulsions, bubbles and foams are multiphase systems that make up important classes of materials that are studied in academia and commercialized by industry.  However, only a limited number of conferences, symposia, and workshops related to emulsions, bubbles and foams have been offered recently. Through this proposed symposium, the global emulsion and bubble/foam communities will have a unique opportunity to interact. Participants in all stages of their career and of diverse backgrounds, especially those from academia and industry, will be encouraged to participate by offering partial financial support.",
