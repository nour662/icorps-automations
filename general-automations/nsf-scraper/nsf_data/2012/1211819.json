 "awd_abstract_narration": "We describe several problems in symplectic geometry which new results and methods, appearing in both Mathematics and Physics, may provide new avenues for. The geometry of the Lagrangian subvarieties of a symplectic manifold has been the subject of a great deal of current research.  One version of this is a construction by Weinstein of the symplectic ``category''  whose objects are symplectic manifolds and whose morphisms are Lagrangian subvarieties.   A recent monograph by Guillemin and Sternberg shows that Weinstein's category and variants of it are powerful tools in semi-classical analysis.  We show hints that this category reveals symmetries in semiclassical systems which are not apparent in the underlying symplectic manifold.  This may be a semiclassical version of a principle advocated by Witten, that a quantum system may be have much more symmetry than the underlying symplectic manifold. Another area we propose investigating is the relation between symplectic geometry and quantum manifold invariants.  Many topological quantum field theories may be interpreted mathematically as counts of points in moduli spaces. One major exception seemed to be Chern-Simons gauge theory; in Physics language, this theory is not supersymmetric. Recent work in Physics (due to Beasley-Witten, Kapustin-Willett-Yaakov, Kallen, and others) has shows that Chern Simons Gauge theory has supersymmetric avatars.  We use this insight to conjecture formulas for quantum manifold invariants which may give more insight into their topological nature.  We also speculate on other possibilities raised by these constructions.\r\n\r\nThe interplay of ideas from Mathematics and Theoretical Physics has been a productive one for both fields. This project develops new perspectives on the relations between these two areas.  The planned project would give both concrete mathematical results and, hopefully, new avenues of interaction between the two fields.  More broadly, problems arising from Physics, and the Mathematics arising from grappling with these problems, have been at the core of Mathematics for centuries.  Quantum Field Theory and String Theory show every promise of playing a similar role in the future, and stimulating new discoveries in Mathematics, which invariably lead to applications far removed from their area of origin.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSymplectic Geometry is a field of Mathematics having its origins in the study of classical mechanics and dynamical systems.  The early discoveries of Lagrange and Hamilton showed that Newton's laws could be described geometrically if the spaces in question came equipped with an antisymmetric bilinear form (analogous in some way to the familiar metric of Riemannian geometry) which satsifies a certain integrability condition (a closed two form).\n\nOne of the central ideas of theoretical physics, the study of quantization, also finds a geometric expression in terms of symplectic geometry.\n\nIn recent years this field has grown into one of the central themes of modern mathematics, with many applications and ideas far beyond these origins in physics and dynamical systems.\n\nThis project involved many aspects of symplectic geometry; in this summary I'll mention two of them.\n\nModuli spaces of vector bundles on curves are central objects in algebraic geometry.  They also appear in gauge theory and in three dimensional topology.  These spaces are symplectic manifolds, and also Kahler varieties.  But while the symplectic structure is canonical, there are many choices for the complex structure.  Making such a choice allows all the power of algebraic geometry to be brought to bear; but it also destroys some of the symmetries of these spaces, meaning that some naturally occuring subvarities are not complex subvarities, and are not visible in the algebraic world.  Topological or symplectic techniques for studying the cohomology of these spaces have a chance of \"seeing\" this extra structure.  This was one of the themes of this project.\n\n \n\nAnother theme centered on quantization of Poisson manifolds.  In the symplectic case, quantization is a long standing problem, though one with many important objectives and conjectures still open.  In the Poisson case, a stunning result of Kontsevich from the 1990s shows that some aspects of quantization carry over to Poisson manifolds.  But there has never been a persuasive attempt to geometrically quantize a Poisson manifold.  In this project, we make a first attempt at geometric quantization of a class of Poisson manifolds that are \"not too far\" from being symplectic.  In this case symplectic geometry provides a guide, and we reach some surprising conculsions about what such a geometric quantization should look like.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan Weitsman"
