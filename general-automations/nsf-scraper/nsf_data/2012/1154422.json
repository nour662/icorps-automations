 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing scholarships to academically promising undergraduate students in biology (excluding pre-medicine), chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics, and physics. This project builds on an S-STEM project that has a record of accomplishment in preparing students for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. Scholarship recipients have included first generation college students, students from low-income/working class families, from rural communities in Appalachia, from underrepresented minorities, female students, and students who transferred from community colleges. This doctoral research university serves a student population that is mostly low- or middle-income, with 43% first generation college students. It is a unique educational setting where low- and middle-income students have the opportunity to study and participate in high quality research under the supervision of research scientists.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project provides a comprehensive approach to mentoring STEM undergraduates. Prior successful activities include a high rate of participation in research experiences, matriculation to graduate study, and progress to STEM careers. Expanded mentoring and advising services build on the success of the Science Learning Community (SLC), which offers academic support and enrichment programs and a supportive residential setting for incoming freshmen STEM majors. The project continues the successful series of research talks and informal mentoring sessions for S-STEM Scholars. Support also includes providing qualified S-STEM Scholars with financial assistance to subsidize both GRE registration and graduate application fees for masters and doctoral programs in STEM disciplines. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project opens opportunities to students from social groups that historically have had low participation in STEM careers. Expanded recruiting efforts focus on recruiting minority and female students and leveraging established community outreach programs, including a science mentoring program for minority high school students, outreach to STEM academies School District, Upward Bound programs, and a partnership with the Girl Scouts of America. Students educated through the S-STEM program promote economic development through their future contributions to high tech enterprises and to advances in science and technology. Those who serve as educators play a crucial role in promoting societal change as role models for their own students.",
