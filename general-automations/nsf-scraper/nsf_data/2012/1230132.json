 "awd_abstract_narration": "This pilot project is an exploratory study of alpine cairns on Baranof Island in Southeast Alaska. This is an archeological investigation engaging experts in the fields of archaeology, botany, and ethnohistory in a multidisciplinary study of upland cairns (artificial arrangements of stacked rocks or mounds of stones) in southeastern Alaska. The PI argues that very little has been done to explore the upland archaeology of the region and nothing is known about the functions of the cairn sites. It has been hypothesized that these structures were used for hunting blinds, burials, boundary markers, etc. The research team proposes to survey the sites and disassemble selected cairns in order to gain data on their age and function. It will also gather oral history from Tlingit elders in the region to determine the extent of their knowledge about traditional Tlingit activities in the alpine areas, the cairns, and perhaps some insights into their function.\r\n\r\nThe project will recover data relating to ages, functions, and distributions of cairns on mountains Southeast Alaska. Cairns appear to be quite prevalent in this region of Alaska but their distribution, specific topographic settings, and functions remains unknown. This investigation has the potential to feed into a much broader research agenda that examines the evolution of social complexity among hunting and gathering groups, one that sheds light on early native North American social and cultural organization. In addition, the project will test an innovative methodology, lichenometry, for dating these rock cairn sites; and is in addition, an innovative project that brings together archaeology and oral historic methods and data to provide new insights on these structures.\r\n\r\nFinally, the project includes partnerships with the US Forest Service (USFS) and local Alaska Native communities interested in the data uncovered by the project. Native communities are very interested in learning more about their ancestors. Native high school and/or college students will be included in the field team and communications with tribal leadership will be enhanced through daily/weekly information exchanges between the PI and tribal liaisons. Investigative data will be utilized by the USFS in developing their plan for protection, preservation and interpretation of their alpine cultural resources.\r\n",

The project focused on artificial cairns in alpine settings above the tree line in central Southeast Alaska.

He was able to draw upon twenty years of ethnographic research in numerous Tlingit communities to conduct interviews with tribal elders. The purpose of this effort was to develop an historical-ecological context for Tlingit cultural activities, migrations, and ethnogeography in alpine settings.

All work was under the supervision of persons with appropriate professional qualifications. This work initially focused on mountain slopes and crests with primary goal of identifying all cairns and other site types of sites in the targeted locality. As a result, the team recorded 50 cairns within 5 sites on Baranof Island. Archaeological data collected during this inventory includes cairn dimensions, GPS positions, still photographic images, and video documentation. Topographic mapping of the research locale and clustered features was undertaken by UNAVCO using ground-based Lidar. With inventory and mapping completed, four alpine cairns were selected for excavation/dismantlement based on their morphology and lichen growth. As each feature was disassembled, archaeologists sought artifacts, faunal and floral materials, and carbon samples from inside and/or immediately under the cairn. All dismantled cairns were subsequently rebuilt within its marked footprint and within its approximate original morphology with lichen-bearing surfaces facing outward to the extent possible. No artifacts occurred within, under, or the excavated cairns. Radiocarbon (AMS) analysis of collected organic materials and lichenometrics indicate that alpine cairns on Cross Peak are prehistoric and built within the last two millennia. Physical, historical, and oral history points to construction of the cairns by ancestors of the Tlingit and, more specifically, by ancestors of Sitka and Kootznoowoo tribes.</p>\n<p>In September 2014, after retrieving a time-lapse camera left to overwinter at Cross Peak, a helicopter survey was conducted over mountains along the lower reaches of Hoonah Sound.

This project contributes to the existing knowledge base of prehistoric and historic land-use in southeast Alaska, a means by which to ascertain how indigenous groups responded to the dynamics of a changing environment. The information collected about human activities on the Baranof, Chichagof, and the broader Alexander Archipelago broadens understanding of past human adaptation to this overall coastal environment. It has the potential to permit an assessment as to how this adaptation may or may not have varied from that of the land use practices of other coastal social systems in the world. In addition, data collected in this case study may be especially useful in understanding human adaptation in relation to rapid climate change due to the 1) rapid and dynamic climate and geomorphological changes in the landscape and 2) long-term habitation by peoples with strong oral tradition and ethnogeographic consciousness and adaptive capacity and resilience,
