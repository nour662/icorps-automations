 "awd_abstract_narration": "For point-to-point communications, channel capacity is very well\r\nunderstood, and there are schemes that approach the capacity for\r\nmost useful channel models. In contrast, the multi-user communication channels\r\nare not as well understood. The channel models are more complicated, there are\r\nmore varieties, and many important problems remain open. As one well-known\r\nexample, the capacity problem for discrete memoryless broadcast channel is\r\nstill unsettled. As another example, the interference channel capacity region\r\nis known only in certain special cases (such as strong interference). What is\r\nclear from the recent studies of such channels is that in a multi-user\r\nwireless network, the key performance limiting factor is often the interference rather \r\nthan the noise, especially at high signal-to-noise ratio.\r\n\r\nTo alleviate this difficulty, the notion of degrees of freedom has been used as\r\na first order characterization of the system throughput as normalized by the\r\nlogarithm of the signal to noise ratio. The total degrees of freedom of\r\nseveral interference networks have been quantified. On the other hand, the\r\ndegrees of freedom region, which is more revealing than the total degrees of\r\nfreedom, is much less well understood. For most of the interference networks,\r\nthe regions remain unknown.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to quantify the degree of freedom regions of a\r\nclass of general interference networks with multiple transmit nodes and\r\nmultiple receive nodes, possibly equipped with multiple antennas, and with\r\ngeneral message demands. In particular, we will study the X interference\r\nnetwork, which include interference channels, broadcast channels, multiple\r\naccess channels, as special cases. Through interference alignment design based\r\non vector and rational independence, we will bound tightly the degrees of\r\nfreedom region and devise schemes that are optimal (or near-optimal) in the\r\ndegree-of-freedom sense.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The project will advance significantly our understanding of\r\ninterference networks, and positively impact the design, architecture, and\r\nsignal design and processing for next generation wireless networks. The\r\nproject will also help train the next generation of researchers and engineers\r\nin the field of signal processing and communication networks.",
