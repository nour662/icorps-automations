 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop in engineering education will bring together a panel of experts to address the chronic question of why under-representation persists in engineering degree programs.  The participants of the workshop will identify the technical, social, political, and/or economic impediments to implementing decades of prior recommendations on mechanisms to enhance racial and ethnic diversity in engineering and develop potential strategies for overcoming these impediments.\r\n\r\nThe results of this workshop can potentially inform more effective efforts to draw on the diverse population of the United States and thus improve both the number and quality of engineering graduates, as well as prepare a more diverse 21st Century workforce.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Identifying and Surmounting Impediments to \nImplementing Diversification Efforts in Engineering Education\n\nA project of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) and the National Academy of Engineering (NAE)\n\nThis project was created in response to the numerous reports that have been released by federal agencies, engineering societies, corporations, and the National Academies over the past 50 years recommending steps to be taken to increase the diversity of students pursuing science and engineering degrees and ultimately increase the diversity of the US technical workforce. \n\nAn analysis by ASEE and NAE indicated that there are consistent themes in the recommendations in these reports including:\n\nInculcating and reinforcing students\u00c6 academic and professional      knowledge; \nPedagogical enhancement of future and current teachers and      faculty;\nStrengthening organizational receptivity to students; \nEnabling economic capacity; \nEnhancing public and community education and institutional      involvement; and \nIncreased educational research and policy development on related      topics.  \n\n\nGiven this consistency in recommendations over such a long period to time, ASEE and NAE did not want to again pursue an examination of how to enhance racial and ethnic diversity in engineering.  Instead the critical question posed for this project was what are and have been the impediments (e.g., technical, social, political, and economic) to implementing the prior recommendations to enhance racial and ethnic diversity in engineering and how can these be overcome? \n\n \n\nIn order to facilitate a reasonable statement of work in the allotted project time frame, the focus of the project was on 1) underrepresented minority populations in engineering fields; and 2) recommendations that address higher education.   The intent of the project was to inform critical stakeholders in the engineering education community, including policy makers, on why past recommendations were not implemented.\n\n \n\nA two-day workshop was organized in the fall of 2013 by ASEE and NAE to convene stakeholders drawn from communities of diversity researchers, social scientists, organizational change researchers, and engineering educators.    The workshop\u00c6s outcomes are outlined in the workshop report Surmounting the Barriers: Ethnic Diversity in Engineering Education which was published by ASEE and NAE in the fall of 2014 and can be assessed for free at https://www.asee.org/Surmounting_the_Barriers.pdf and www.nap.edu.\n\n \n\nThe workshop report includes a summary of pre-workshop survey research questions which were used to explore and confirm the identity of specific impediments and their importance as well as identification of specific instances when impediments have been identified and surmounted and whether the implemented strategies might be taken to scale.  The workshop was structured so as to explore issues specific to the strengths and challenges of geographic regions (e.g., California, Florida, the Upper Midwest, and Texas).  The workshop report notes that researchers identified several key impediments including:\n\nLack of incentives for faculty and institutions;\nInadequate or only short-term financial support for students;\nUnsupportive      institutional and faculty culture and environment;\nLack      of institutional and constituent engagement;\nSystemic      problems in higher education, including inadequate faculty skills and K-12      engagement;\nLack      of learning communities that can improve retention;\nA difficult      curriculum, heavy on math; and\nInadequate      assessments, metrics, and data tracking.\n\n\n \n\nASEE and NAE disseminated the workshop report Surmounting the Barriers widely through existing channels of communication and publications.   The report was a resource for the ASEE board authorized 2014-2015 Year of ACTION on Diversity where members discussed, engaged, and highlighted individual and collective activities that serve to advance the ..."
