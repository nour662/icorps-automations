 "awd_abstract_narration": "The complexity of modern high-end computers has made it exceedingly \r\ndifficult for scientific applications to effectively manage resources \r\nsuch as extreme-scale parallelism, single-chip multi-processors, \r\nand deep hierarchy of shared/distributed caches and memories. In \r\nparticular, as machines and applications have both evolved to become \r\ncomplex and massively parallel, compilers have failed to automatically \r\nbridge the gap between complex software and diverse hardware platforms.\r\nOptimization models for  parallel computing have lagged far behind \r\nthose for serial applications, and conventional compilers are \r\nincreasingly unable to accommodate emerging high-end architectures.\r\n\r\nThis research develops a new optimization model that allows\r\n1) developers to effectively interact with advanced optimizing \r\ncompilers to provide both domain-specific knowledge and high-level \r\noptimization strategies (e.g., directions to enable new or choose \r\namongst differing parallelization strategies); 2) computational \r\nspecialists to easily define arbitrary domain-specific transformations \r\nto directly control performance optimizations to their code; \r\n3) architecture-sensitive optimizations to be easily parameterized  \r\nand empirically tuned to achieve portable high performance.\r\nThe optimization model is supported with an integrated environment \r\nthat contains two main components: ROSE, a C/C++/Fortran2003 \r\nsource-to-source optimizing compiler developed at DOE/LLNL; and POET, \r\na transformation language together with an empirical optimization \r\nengine developed at UTSA. This framework permits different levels \r\nof automation and programmer intervention, from fully-automated tuning \r\nto semi-automated development to fully programmable control. The research \r\ntargets both the optimization needs of computational kernels and the more \r\ngeneral requirements of whole program optimizations.  The framework is \r\nintegrated as an external development mechanism for the widely-adopted \r\nATLAS library and is connected with empirical tuning research under \r\nDOE SciDAC program to improve the efficiency of large-scale scientific \r\napplications.\r\n",
