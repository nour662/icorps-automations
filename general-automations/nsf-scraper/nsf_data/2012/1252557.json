 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant funds travel to a meeting of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers to promote synergies between the two fields.  Advances in several AI areas, such as data mining, natural language understanding and constraint solving, have become ready for application in many domains, including SE. SE as an area for AI -- automating the activities of programmers -- is still a long-term vision for AI. SE goals, such as component-based, evolvable software containing valid world models and correct code, are important to AI as they are to other fields. The workshop will explore synergies between the fields and serve as a planning meeting for future interactions.",

The aim of the RAISE workshop was to answer the question:\n\n         Are SE and AI researchers ignoring important insights from AI and SE?\n\n Thus RAISE \u00c613 was a crossover workshop where the state of the art in both fields was documented and extended.   This workshop explored not only the application of AI techniques to software engineering problems but also the application of software engineering techniques to AI problems.

The  workshop brought together researchers from the AI and software engineering disciplines to build on the interdisciplinary synergies which exist and to stimulate research across these disciplines.\nThe first part of the workshop was devoted to current results and consisted of presentations and discussion of the state of the art.
