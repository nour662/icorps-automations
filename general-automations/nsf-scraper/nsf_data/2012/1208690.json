 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies how to use co-robot systems and math-oriented co-robotics competitions to enhance student engagement, increase student motivation in learning Algebra and subsequent STEM subjects, and interest in pursuing STEM related careers and post-secondary study.  The project leverages a unique robotics platform called Mobot (an intelligent modular system designed for K-12 education) to prepare a cohort of teachers to engage their students with relevant pedagogy that illustrates abstract math concepts with concrete applications using computing and robotics.  As such, there are four basic research questions that guide project: (1) To what extent do fellows' students exhibit (a) increased interest in STEM coursework and careers, and (b) increased knowledge of computing and robotics? (2)  How do fellows' students compare to similar students in non-participating teachers' classes in indicators of academic achievement and engagement? (3) How does students' participation in robotics dance and math robotics competitions contribute to their interest in pursuing computing and STEM careers and coursework? (4) To what extent do after school programs integrate the curriculum developed by this project?\r\n\r\nEach year, the project recruits 15 mathematics, computer science, and technology teachers to participate as Robotics Fellows.  These fellows experience an intensive week long summer professional development with follow up throughout the academic year.  For implementation in formal and informal settings, the project team works with curriculum experts and teachers in creating teaching plans, instructional materials and evaluations for a co-robot curriculum.  The project is integrated with the annual UC Davis Center for Computing and STEM Education Day, where teachers and students participating in the project showcase their accomplishments.\r\n\r\nA mixed methods approach is used to determine the effects of the professional development and to measure student outcomes. Both formative and summative evaluation strategies inform the development and implementation of the project. As such, the project will advance theory, design, and practice in middle and high school mathematics, technology and design-based classrooms through the use of a field tested co-robotics curriculum.",

Through this project, the UC Davis Center for Integrated Computing and STEM Education (C-STEM) has developed and provides innovative hands-on integrated programming, robotics and math curricula along with a set of easy to use technology tools for students and offers comprehensive professional development for K-14 educators, many of whom have no experience with programming and/or robotics. The C-STEM curriculum, programming and robotics resources have been successfully used by K-14 teachers in both formal and informal programs for integrated learning of math and computer science with hands-on robotics.</p>\n<p>The mission of the C-STEM Center is to broaden participation of students traditionally underrepresented in computing and STEM related careers and post-secondary study and to develop students&rsquo; 21st century problem-solving skills to tackle real world concerns through integrated computing and STEM education. Through this project, C-STEM became now a University of California (UC) Approved Educational Preparation Program for undergraduate admission for all UC campuses. C-STEM now also has the prestigious University of California Office of the President (UCOP) A-G Program Status.</p>\n<p>This project developed a suite of innovative educational technology tools:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://c-stem.ucdavis.edu/studio/\" target=\"_parent\">C-STEM Studio</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em><a href=\"http://c-stem.ucdavis.edu/studio/roboblockly/\" target=\"_parent\">RoboBlockly</a></em></strong>&nbsp;. C-STEM Studio is a comprehensive user-friendly platform for teaching computing and STEM with robotics for integrated learning. The Studio includes code, comprehensive documentation, teacher guides, textbooks and activities all in one download. RoboBlockly is a web-based robot simulation platform for learning coding and math. RoboBlockly uses a simple puzzle-piece interface to program virtual Linkbot and &nbsp;Lego Mindstorms NXT/EV3 robots. Constructing programs with blocks can also generate Ch/C/C++ code that can be used to control real robots directly. The RoboBlockly curriculum includes student self-guided Hour of Code, robotics, and teacher-led math activities. Both C-STEM Studio and RoboBlockly are provided to schools and students at no cost. At the peak, more than 10,000 students a day use the web site for RoboBlockly to learn math and computing with robotics.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;developed <a href=\"http://c-stem.ucdavis.edu/curriculum/ict-pathway/\">C-STEM Math-ICT Curriculum</a>&nbsp;provides K-12 students with 12 years of hands-on integrated math and&nbsp;computer science education with coding in Blockly and Ch/C/C++. The curriculum has been adopted by more than 60 school districts. The C-STEM curriculum is one of a handful recognized computing programs recommended by a committee for <a href=\"https://code.org/educate/curriculum/3rd-party\">Beyond Hour of Code.</a></p>\n<p>The project developed a unique professional development (PD) model, including train-the-trainer program, with various options to prepare STEM teachers who have no prior computer programming or robotics experience to quickly use C-STEM tools to bring the C-STEM integrated curriculum in their classroom teaching. C-STEM&rsquo;s teacher training sessions have been designed to meet the specific needs of K-12 educators in terms of time commitment, useful-content, classroom implementation needs, availability of follow-up sessions and local access. Current C-STEM PD offerings range from on-site training, &nbsp;1-Day Academy, &nbsp;2-Day Academy, 1-Week Institute, 1-Week Workshop, to Train-the-Trainer program to prepare STEM teachers to integrate computing and robotics into their regular STEM courses as well as to offer new courses on computer science, robotics, and Cyber Physical Systems.</p>\n<p>The C-STEM Center along with industry partners organize an annual curriculum-based level playing field RoboPlay Challenge and RoboPlay Video Competitions on C-STEM Day in different regions to further engage students in project-based team activities that showcase their accomplishments and creativity in not only math and engineering, but also in writing, art, music and film production. The RoboPlay Challenge competition is unique in that challenge tasks are not announced until C-STEM Day. Student teams are assigned to different divisions by their math levels. Over 600 students participated RoboPlay Competition in 2016 at two sites (Davis and Irvine, CA) with high percentage of female (over 30%) and other groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM (over 70% non-white).</p>\n<p>By making connections across the STEM disciplines, the C-STEM curriculum helps students to connect regular STEM topics to real-life experiences, while developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The integrated C-STEM curriculum has shown great promise in closing the math achievement gap for schools with a large percentage of underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/23/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Harry&nbsp;H&nbsp;Cheng</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1208690/1208690_10210531_1482546007677_StudentsCSTEMday--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1208690/1208690_10210531_1482546007677_StudentsCSTEMday--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students at the UC Davis C-STEM  RoboPlay Challenge Competition, 2016\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1208690/1208690_10210531_1482546007677_StudentsCSTEMday--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students at the UC Davis C-STEM  RoboPlay Challenge Competition, 2016\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students at the UC Davis C-STEM  RoboPlay Challenge Competition, 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UC Davis C-STEM Center</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Harry&nbsp;H&nbsp;Cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students at the UC Davis C-STEM  RoboPlay Challenge Competition, 2016</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1208690/1208690_10210531_1482545885118_C-STEM-ProfessionalDevelopment--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1208690/1208690_10210531_1482545885118_C-STEM-ProfessionalDevelopment--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"C-STEM Professional Development.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1208690/1208690_10210531_1482545885118_C-STEM-ProfessionalDevelopment--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"C-STEM Professional Development.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">C-STEM Professional Development.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UC Davis C-STEM Center</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Harry&nbsp;H&nbsp;Cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">C-STEM Professional Development.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1208690/1208690_10210531_1482545782809_AboutUsCSTEM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1208690/1208690_10210531_1482545782809_AboutUsCSTEM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UC Davis C-STEM Program\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1208690/1208690_10210531_1482545782809_AboutUsCSTEM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UC Davis C-STEM Program\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UC Davis C-STEM Program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UC Davis C-STEM Center</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Harry&nbsp;H&nbsp;Cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UC Davis C-STEM Program</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
