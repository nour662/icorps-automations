 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate a prototype of a\r\nhigh-throughput, agile, low-cost manufacturing system for tile mosaics. Mosaics have been a source of\r\nvisual splendor for millennia, but they have always required arduous and painstaking hand assembly.\r\nOur Phase I proved the feasibility of a programmable, high-throughput robotic tile-assembly system to\r\nenhance the production of mosaic tilings. Phase II R&D will build upon Phase I success to further speed\r\nup, automate and scale the system, develop an effective agile manufacturing management system, and\r\nanalyze the economic viability of robotic mosaic assembly for Phase III. We will accomplish this by\r\nenhancing the mechanical processes and reducing operator time - in addition to developing a productionflow\r\ninformation system. After Phase II system optimization, we will evaluate the commercial potential\r\nof the Artaic technology. The anticipated technical result will be providing a 5x faster manufacturing\r\nprocess with a 75% reduction in the price per square foot of customizable mosaic tilings produced. The\r\nintellectual merits of this SBIR project involve Artaic?s disruptive robotic technology, which transforms\r\nmosaic installation from its current, time-consuming manual labor processes to a rapid, robotically\r\ndirected customizable process.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project expands the utilization of artisanal mosaic work\r\nwhile increasing the competitive advantage of U.S. manufacturing processes through increased\r\nautomation and customization. Successful development of this technology will enable a breakthrough\r\npricing structure that is 75% lower than the competition (based on manual and rudimentary automated\r\nprocesses), leading to broad market affordability and widespread commercial adoption. Our robotic\r\nsystem has the potential to revolutionize the $76B global tile industry, while creating numerous\r\ndomestic job opportunities. Artaic expects that the 5x increase in manufacturing speed realized during\r\nPhase I will be maintained in Phase II during manufacturing scale-up without loss of placement\r\naccuracy. The increased understanding of robotic agile manufacturing-enabled mass customization\r\nprocesses will expand the scientific understanding of related robotic processes that utilize highthroughput\r\nflexible assemblies, such as for medical or pharmaceutical technologies, or for consumer\r\nproducts. In addition, classical mosaic techniques will become more accessible as an art form to all\r\nstudents, while undergraduate students will increase their understanding of STEM concepts through\r\nengineering courses utilizing this technology. Artists and designers will find the realization of their\r\ndesign work much more practical and affordable as a business enterprise.",
