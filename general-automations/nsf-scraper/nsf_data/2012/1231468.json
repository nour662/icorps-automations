 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: There is much to be learned about the roles of prokaryotic microbes (bacteria and archaea) in the physiology, biochemistry, and ecology of reef-forming corals. The importance of greater understanding of prokaryote associations has become especially evident because it is now known that many corals harbor endosymbiotic prokaryotes with multiple, significant effects on coral biology.  This project will assess how different prokaryotic communities affect the biogeochemistry of nitrogen within the coral, and how these microbial communities, and the functions they carry out, are affected by global climate change. To accomplish this, the latest high-throughput-sequencing (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic) tools will be used to examine the taxonomic and functional diversity of these symbioses in a model coral from the Caribbean, Montastraea cavernosa.  Proposed experiments will elucidate the effects of thermal stress on these prokaryotic communities, as well as the coral host and symbiotic dinoflagellates (i.e., zooxanthellae) from individual corals. The bioinformatic analysis of the sequence data from this project will result in the discovery of novel prokaryotes and increase our understanding of the taxonomic and functional biodiversity of prokaryotes in corals.  Broader Impacts: The particular metatranscriptomic approach described in this project is novel in its application to corals and their multiple symbionts and could be an important advance in applying molecular techniques to the study of corals.  This project will also support the research activities of both undergraduate and graduate students who will work closely with the principal investigators on their individualized research projects. Both the investigators and students supported on this project will also engage in public outreach events to provide environmental education lectures about the ecology and conservation of coral reefs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe role of symbiotic microbes in the biology of many marine organisms remains unknown and spans from beneficial to producing disease in some cases.  During the duration of this project we sought to better understand the multiple roles of symbiotic microbes in the biology of corals and sponges.  We used an array of techniques  from physiological, biochemical and molecular measurements to investigate process such as nutrient biochemistry, the role of microbes in disease and the effects of climate change, such as ocean acidification and warming seawater, on the structure and function of symbiotic microbial communities.  Our results have shown that these microbes have a wide range of responses and roles in the health of their coral or sponge hosts.  These changes in the \"microbiome\" of the host are as important to these marine organisms as shifts in the microbiome are to the health and wellfare of human beings.  Our results have shown the following;\n\n1.  The microbiome of different coral species is often very specific but can also be affected by different environmental conditions.\n\n2.  Changes in the microbiome of corals and sponges, when exposed to future conditions of ocean acidification and increasing seawater temperatures, causes both predictable and unpredictable changes that significantly affects the ecological function of their hosts.\n\n3.  That the bacterial agents of previously described coral diseases cannot always be isolated from corals exhibiting the supposed signs of that disease.  This suggest that rather than having specific pathogens, most examples of coral disease are opportunistic in a similar manner to the increase in hospital acquired diseases in humans when their resistance is low.\n\n4.  The expression of genes in the host sponge or coral are significantly affected by the community structure of the microbiome under a range of environmental conditions.\n\nDuring the period of this project we were able to train several undergraduates and two graduate students in the microbil ecology of coral reefs and presented our data in numerous professional and public outreach venues. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael P Lesser"
