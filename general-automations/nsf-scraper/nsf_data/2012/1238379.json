 "awd_abstract_narration": "End-to-end high performance networking must continue to develop to keep pace with the computing ecosystem. While the community continues to make significant strides in high-performance computing, the ability to transfer the vast amounts of data generated by scientists has failed to increase commensurately. When scientists spend time dealing with data movement, or are limited by lack of timely access to data, the potential for scientific progress is hampered. Today, there are many application communities struggling with the well-known performance problems in TCP/IP in order to do the real work they need to do.\r\nThis proposal would support the continued development and deployment of Phoebus, a protocol and service implementation for improving end-to-end transfers to gigabit speeds. Phoebus provides a network \"inlay\" that augments the network topology with an additional layer of protocol and functionality. Phoebus leverages the ubiquitous TCP/IPv4 implementation on the end hosts, while providing an adaptor to translate to a variety of alternate protocols over the wide area, including creation of virtual networks on the fly. Many data-intensive applications can use Phoebus without modification and without making any system-level changes.\r\nPhoebus makes use of a session-layer protocol called XSP, for eXtensible Session Protocol, for end-to-end communication and uses various transport layer protocol instances on different segments of the network, as appropriate. In many cases, performance can be improved by simply using existing protocols tuned based on network conditions and properties. Similarly, a high performance TCP alternative can be used when more assumptions about the underlying network can be made.\r\n\r\nPhoebus is essentially a WAN accelerator for research and education networks. This project will work with various application communities to modify their software as necessary to make use of Phoebus and XSP. This will enable the creation of an automatically tuned data movement service, as well as the creation of appliances to act as \"on-ramps\" to dynamic circuit networks. Broader impact will therefore include significantly improved data transfer performance for scientific applications. Intellectual merit is found in the work's creative approach to adapting the concept of WAN acceleration to a multi-prototcol high bandwidth high delay environment.",

Kissel, Indiana University\n \n1 Outcomes\nDespite continuing advances in the link speeds of networks, data movement\nremains a key problem in many scientist\u00c6s lives. In the era of Big Data, with\nincreasingly distributed collaborative endeavors, moving and sharing significant\namounts of data is critical. This is challenging for various reasons and\nmany researchers still share data by shipping physical disks. Understanding\nthis detriment to progress, the NSF has supported significant investments in\nnetwork capacity for educational institutions. Yet even when there is ample\ninfrastructure, it is not straightforward to manage high-throughput data\ntransfers. The goal of the Phoebus project is to produce a system that eases\nthis process for science users by automatically accelerating data movement.\nThis project supported the development of Phoebus, a protocol and\nservice implementation for improving end-to-end transfers to multi-gigabit\nspeeds.

Our testing and evaluation showed dramatic performance increases,\neven while using well-tuned applications that were already achieving good\nperformance over the standard IP network. Bill Owens, a Director at NYSERNet,\nthe research and education network in New York, noted \"A physics\nresearcher at Syracuse University has been able to increase his performance\nby over 10 times, reducing the time needed to transfer a dataset that is\ncentral to his research from 40 days to less than 4!\"\n2 Intellectual Merit\nThe Phoebus project produced an open architecture for a network acceleration\nservice, and a body of work studying its characteristics. The architecture\nis driven by features of networks, some that we have applied and some that\nwe derived in the course of our work.\nThe Phoebus approach contributes to the community\u00c6s body of knowledge,\nstanding as an approach differing from the current state of the art.\nThe \"Science DMZ\" model being adopted by much of the community suggests\nbuilding loss-free network enclaves, and placing data transfer nodes\nin them. The Phoebus approach mitigates the effects of loss across existing\ncampus networks and broadens the reach of advanced networks. At the\nother end of the spectrum, WAN acceleration devices are widely used in enterprise\nnetworks, but are vendor-specific and proprietary. We have designed\nan open, extensible architecture network services including our open-source\naccelerator.\n3 Broader Impacts\nThe impact of high-performance networking on both science and society is\nunquestionable and profound. In that sense, fundamental work in improving\nnetwork performance and functionality has an impact. Further, we have\nproduced a software artifact that has been used in various large-scale scientific\ncollaborations including the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave\nObservatory (LIGO) project, the CMS project in the Large Hadron Collider\ncol..."
