 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tropical grasslands, or savannas, cover over 20 percent of the land on Earth, support most of the world's livestock and wild herbivores, and thus feed a large fraction of the world's population.  At their edges, savannas often grade into forest, and they can shrink or expand depending on whether the forests advance or retreat.  Three major factors seem likely to account for the boundary between savanna and forest: fire that kills trees, rainfall that sustains them, and the grazing of the herbivores on tree seedlings and grass.  This project will mount a very large field experiment in one of the most productive savannas in the world, the Serengeti of Tanzania, to test which combinations of fire, water, and grazing best maintain savanna. Researchers from the U.S. and Tanzania will plant seeds and seedlings of dominant trees into fenced or unfenced, and burned or unburned areas within different sites that range from low to high rainfall, and then measure the success of the trees over three years.\r\n\r\nBesides giving us new understanding of why savannas occur where they do and how their boundaries may change in the future, knowledge important to our ability to manage livestock and provide food, this research will train new scientists, promote international collaboration, and build the capacity for science in the developing world.  The project will help train two Tanzanian researchers plus a Tanzanian graduate student at the University of Missouri and a postdoctoral scholar at Wake Forest University in North Carolina.  To build scientific capacity in Africa, the project will offer annual workshops on data collection and statistics for students at Tanzania's Sokoine University of Agriculture.",

Our project set out to answer the following question: what prevents trees from taking over savannas, establishing and growing in the open patches of grassland that are so common in this biome? We addressed this fundamental issue by exploring the factors causing tree limitation across a large African savanna ecosystem. Specifically, we studied the factors that limit tree seed germination and seedling establishment across a moisture gradient spanning 200 km of native savanna in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania. The Serengeti is an ideal natural laboratory for this question because it harbors all of the factors potentially influencing seed germination and seedling growth&mdash;fire, large herbivores, competition with grasses, and the availability of soil nutrients and water. As such, it provides a model for other savannas that evolved under similar conditions in the past, including those in North America.</p>\n<p>Over a multi-year study, we manipulated fire, soil moisture, herbivory and grass cover across 38 plots, tracked the success of transplanted seeds and seedlings, and followed the fate of ~700 adult trees. Our work showed that the two dominant overstory trees in the system, <em>Acacia tortilis</em> and <em>A. robusta</em>, are strongly seed-limited, but that seed production, germination and infestation by insect seed predators varies across sites and years. <em>A. tortilis</em> averages ~ 4 fold higher germination rate than <em>A. robusta</em>, but both species experience higher germination rates in wet compared to dry sites. Our work demonstrated strong negative effect of grass competition on seedling survival and growth, which overwhelmed water-addition and herbivore removal treatments (Figure 1). We found weak support for a systematic effect of fire on seedling recruitment but instead found that fire has a net negative effect at the wet end of the precipitation gradient and a net positive effect at the dry end. We hypothesize that hotter, more destructive fires in productive environments explain the negative effect, and that a reduction of tree-grass competition at the dry end (where water is limiting) may explain the positive effect. Together, these effects lead to a tree population with a strongly bimodal size distribution (i.e., consisting of small and large trees, but not intermediate-sized ones) that is a product of a recruitment bottleneck at the sapling stage. At the adult end of the tree life cycle, we find a persistent decline in density (the opposite to what we find at the seedling stage) driven primarily by elephant herbivory, suggesting that the system has switched from being largely fire-dominated in the recent past to herbivore-dominated today.
