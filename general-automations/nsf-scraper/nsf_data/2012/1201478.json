The purpose of the event is to present some of the recent significant theoretical advances in the aforementioned areas to an audience comprising both experts and young analysts. It is the hope of the organizers is that, as a by-product of the conference, a plan will emerge for coordinating attacks on certain problems arising in physics and engineering for which the lack of smoothness (caused by domains with intricate/irregular geometry, including slits and fractures) is a natural feature. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
