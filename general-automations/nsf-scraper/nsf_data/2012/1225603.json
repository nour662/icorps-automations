 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two-year colleges (TYCs) play a significant role in the United States' higher education system, serving 36% of the students in higher education.  Retraining in growth areas such as the medical field or alternative energy often requires content knowledge in physics. But the needs go beyond just content knowledge.  Future employees are in need of skill sets such as scientific problem solving, synthesizing information and product design. While traditional instruction provides discipline-based content, it does not always allow students to develop these skills. Substantial efforts have been made to develop research-based instructional strategies in physics that enhance both content learning and development of scientific skill sets. However, the American Institute of Physics survey of TYC physics faculty members has shown that traditional lectures occurred in over 60% of the classes most of the time and 43% of the respondents at TYCs were not using a single innovative strategy listed on the survey. \r\n\t\r\nThe major goal of this project is to have a significant impact on STEM education at TYCs by providing sixty new TYC physics instructors with an eighteen-month intensive professional development experience that includes: (1) on-line interactions among project staff and participants, focused on seminal papers in physics education; (2) a 4-day immersion experience, in workshop format, where participants receive direct experience with several research-based instructional strategies;  (3) post-conference online mentoring and on-site meetings with select mentees; and (4) a follow-up conference conducted in tandem with a national American Association of Physics Teachers meeting where participants present capstone projects.\r\n\r\nThe second project goal is to further the development of the next generation of leaders in the TYC physics community by recognizing as \"alumni-in-residence\" past program graduates who exhibited early leadership traits while in the program. These program alumni are sharing their recent transformations with current participants and providing insight into the philosophical approach the leadership team strategically employs in each aspect of the experience.  They are also being mentored in physics community leadership and provided opportunities to lead sessions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe New Faculty Experience for Two-Year College Physics was designed to investigate the effectiveness of an 18-month experience in improving the use of research-based instructional strategies by instructors new to teaching physics at Two-Year Colleges.  We found that this 18-month experience proves very effective in providing both the knowledge and support to transform instructional strategies implemented by the participants.  It is our belief that the support from the community of learners is vital to the success of the program.\n\n \n\nThe experience included five weeks of on-line interaction where participants and mentors discussed a different seminal paper in Physics Education Research each week.  This laid the ground work for a four-day, 40 hours, workshop where participants explored multiple research-based instructional strategies that have been successfully implemented at two-year colleges by seasoned physics instructors.   The entire workshop was taught using active-engagement strategies, modeling for the participants how to effectively engage throughout the entire classroom experience.  Participants not only learned the advantages of the various approaches, but also explored potential pitfalls to avoid in implementation.  They also worked in small groups to create activities ready to implement when they left the workshop. \n\n \n\nFollowing the workshop, participants continued to receive support through the online environment for the next 16 months.  It was especially true during this time, that the community of peers provided essential support in helping instructors through the tough and draining process of transforming their approach to teaching.  Each participant was required to post activities that they developed for feedback, butwere also encouraged to post journals of their efforts.  Many faculty posted entries of success and failures in the classroom over the course of the 16-months.  The community provided the nurturing and encouragement for instructors to learn from lessons that went awry and to build on the success.  Speaking of building on successes, we found that instructors who were active in the online community were just as able to build on the success of others as they were able to build on their own success.\n\n \n\nThe commencement conference brought participants together for a second workshop.  This workshop started with an optional day focused on Astronomy, a subject many but not all Two-Year College Physics Instructors often teach.  The second workshop also had a major theme of stressing the importance of scholarly contribution to the profession.  All participants were required to give either a poster or oral presentation on some aspect of their work during the 18-month experience.  The commencement conference is held in tandem with the Summer National Meeting of the American Association of Physics Teachers and both the oral and poster presentations were repeated during this conference.  We were especially pleased with the results of the final cohort, where five papers were published or accepted for publication from cohort members.  This is highly significant when compared to the extremely poor contribution from the greater two-year college physics community where journal articles are rarely produced.   \n\n \n\nA second component of the project was to investigate how to produce the next set of leaders for the two-year college physics community.  Many of the past leaders have retired over the last five to ten years and of the few remaining leaders several are nearing retirement.  The community was struggling to produce and mentor younger professionals to take leadership roles.  We created the Alumni-in-Residence program to work with instructors that had successfully completed the New Faculty Experience in an earlier cohort and to give them an opportunity to help lead sessions.  This proved highly valuable, both to the current cohort of new faculty and to the alumni leading the session.  In addition, sessions on leadership development modeled after the work done through Project Kaleidoscope were led.  Some of these sessions were private sessions for those in the Alumni-in-Residence program, while others were open to the entire two-year college physics community.  Much was learned from our first attempts and the early indication is that the last cohort of Alumni-in-Residence will indeed fill critical roles in the Two-Year College Physics community. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott F Schultz"
