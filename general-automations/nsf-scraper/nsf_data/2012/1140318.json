 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates an educational software infrastructure by broadening the support for the successful BusTracker.edu API to support computer programming projects that use real-time Web-based data to better engage and better train introductory computer science students. Examples of real-time data accessible over the Web include stock values, traffic information, weather, public transit, flight information, inventory overviews, and many others. The infrastructure ensures the requisite data availability, integrity, and accessibility, as well as automates grading techniques.\r\n\r\nBy bringing real-world, real-time data of intrinsic interest to students in introductory classes, more students are expected to be recruited into and retained in the computer science major. The new programming projects also provide an opportunity to introduce students earlier to advanced concepts such as distributed computing and cyber-physical systems, thereby better preparing them to meet the emerging challenges of the IT workplace.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the infrastructure, the project will produce a set of programming assignments using the infrastructure suitable for CS 1 and CS 2 courses. Evaluation encompasses both the new system, as well as the effect of its use on student learning outcomes and on retention. The infrastructure will be available through a dedicated website and a number of workshops will assist faculty in learning to use the new system in their courses.",
