 "awd_abstract_narration": "A persisting gap in recruiting talented students to careers in science is targeting students from historically underrepresented minority groups.  The number of underrepresented minorities in neuroscience is woefully small despite the ever growing numbers of these populations in the US.   The prevailing view, supported by studies of high school and college students, is that the solution to the problem of minority access to research careers is 1) to engage and nurture these students through early inclusion in research projects, coupled with 2) academic and social support and professional development.  Exposure to effective role models, i.e. members of underrepresented minorities who have achieved a measure of success, is warranted as it allows students to see themselves in similar roles.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of the University of Minnesota Minority Undergraduate Summer Research Program (May 31-August 11) is to establish a rigorous program to recruit, nurture, and mentor promising undergraduate science majors from traditionally underrepresented populations to professional careers in research in neuroscience.  This project will 1) recruit these students to a career in science early in their undergraduate career by providing them with a significant research experience, 2) expose these students to the field of biological sciences at large through a capstone poster presentation with students in other research areas, and 3) retain these students in the field, through professional development and ongoing mentored support.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding the brain and how it functions is such a high national research priority that President Obama highlighted it in his 2013 State of the Union Address.  To meet the President's bold challenge it is necessary to educate and recruit the future generations of scientists who will devote their careers to the study of the nervous system.  The goal of this summer research program held at the University of Minnesota in 2012 was to offer outstanding undergraduate science majors the opportunity to conduct neuroscience research as a means of interesting them in research careers.  An attendant priority was to recruit members of racial and ethnic groups that are woefully underrepresented among neuroscience researchers in the US.  In this 10 week program, four students received extensive research training along with seminars in research ethics and professional skill development.  The summer program culminated in an all-campus scientific poster session in which the students presented the outcomes of their summer research experience to faculty, graduate and professional students, and interested members of the community.  Faculty evaluations of the students' research performance indicated that all of the students had a high aptitude for research in the field of neuroscience and this was communicated to the students.  Feedback from the students confirmed the primary goal of the summer program as all students asserted an interest in a neuroscience research career and attributed that to the summer research experience.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/08/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert L Meisel"
