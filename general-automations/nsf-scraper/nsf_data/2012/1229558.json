 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to New Mexico State University (NMSU) is for the acquisition of a state-of-the-art high resolution atomic force microscope (AFM) system.  The instrument will be installed in a readily-accessible centralized core facility that supports the NMSU main campus and five satellite community colleges. AFM is an indispensable tool in characterizing surface topography on the nanoscale via phase or force imaging.  It will enhance process development and analysis of nanostructured materials as well as provide a new resource to probe specific and dynamic interactions of complex physic-chemical, biological, and agricultural systems.  A multidisciplinary group of junior and senior faculty from  the Colleges of Engineering; Arts and Sciences; and Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences with active research programs will expand their investigations and teaching into nanoscience and nanotechnology by employing the unique capabilities of the AFM. Specific research projects that will directly benefit from the instrument include thin film morphology of nonmetals (such as graphene), metals, metal-oxides, nitrides, carbides, and their nanocomposites; surface functionalization of nanomaterials and microstructural changes in material surfaces; imaging in soft biological and agricultural materials; electrochemical investigation on addressable array platforms; and, optical, magnetic, and electrical properties of materials, etc.    \r\n\r\nThe new AFM will impact not only the specific research programs, but also help to catalyze and promote a broader, college-wide initiative in materials research and education at NMSU. The centrally-located instrument will significantly enhance the research and breadth of capabilities of more than one-hundred faculty, staff, and students. In addition, this modern AFM includes design features for ease-of-use and versatility for multi-disciplinary applications that facilitate high quality educational training and will be used for student training, classroom demonstrations, and sponsored workshops.  This project bridges the gap between the classroom and the research lab. The combination of a modern AFM in a managed core facility with established informal and formal training for a multi-disciplinary user base will have a positive impact on nanoscience and microscopic imaging research and education in southern New Mexico, the borderland region, and beyond.",
