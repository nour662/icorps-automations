 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this grant, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will organize and run a series of interdisciplinary conferences in the mathematical and computational sciences during the three year period between April 2013 through March 2016. Conferences to be held in the first year of the award are as follows:  SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (Austin, TX), SIAM Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems (Snowbird, UT), SIAM Conference on Mathematical Aspects of Materials Science (Philadelphia, PA), SIAM Conference on Control and Its Applications (San Diego, CA), Applied Algebraic Geometry (Fort Collins, CO), SIAM Conference on Geometric and Physical Modeling (place to be determined), Analysis of Partial Differential Equations (place to be determined), and Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing (place to be determined.)  The funding will support travel of students, early career professionals and invited speakers to SIAM conferences and dissemination of invited conference presentations and tutorials to the wider community. \r\n\r\nSIAM interdisciplinary conferences are distinguished from other conferences in the mathematical and computational sciences by the extent to which they routinely attract researchers and practitioners from within the mathematical and computational sciences and simultaneously from within other sciences, industrial organizations and government laboratories. As a result they contribute to advances in the sciences, in government programs, and to the economic competitiveness of the United States. The conferences in the series address a broad range of topics and applications, giving them intellectual vibrancy, timeliness, and reach, and they utilize an open format to identify and incubate emerging areas through community proposed sessions. The conferences provide a welcoming environment for students and early career professionals, integrating education with research. Oversight of the conferences by SIAM officers promotes diversity by forceful and supportive encouragement of diversity among organizing committees and invited speakers. In addition, a special focus on diversity is provided by the SIAM Workshops Celebrating Diversity.",
