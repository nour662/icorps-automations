 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Global Environment for Network Innovations 'GENI' is a suite of research infrastructure supported by the NSF that is rapidly emerging in prototype form across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research into very large socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for 'at scale' experiments in future internets.\r\n\r\nThe GENI Project Office organizes three major GENI Engineering conferences (GEC) per year, in which the entire GENI community meets to review current status, and to decide on subsequent steps in GENI's evolution. These GECs include community-based working groups leading GENI's design and planning, and demonstrating progress with live experiments.\r\n\r\nUCLA is hosting the thirteenth edition of the GENI Engineering conference.  This project supports organizing the demo session to be held on the UCLA Campus. About 400 leading researchers and Ph.D. students from diverse US institutions will gather at UCLA to showcase their ideas and results.  The Campus Technology Services will fit the venue to support high speed networking experiments both wired and wireless. In particular, a 10GB link will be enabled and each demo will be provided with 1G wired connection. The venue will be also connected to the National Lambda Rail (NLR) and Internet2 Interoperable On-demand Network (ION) network infrastructures thus enabling researchers and practitioners to access all the GENI sites nationwide. Each GEC 13th participant will be issued temporary campus-wide wireless credentials that will grant access to the campus wireless infrastructure and commodity Internet for the duration of the event. Furthermore, 4G wireless connectivity will be made available through the GENI-WiMax infrastructure.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The GEC Demo sessions provide graduate students with both an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to formal publication.   It helps new graduate students understand what is being done with GENI and encourages cross-university cooperation by providing a method for students and faculty to discover who amongst their peers at other institutions might be valuable resources.   It also supports outreach to new community members, including the emerging US Ignite community.",
