 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Vitaly Kresin's group from the University of Southern California will introduce an approach for manipulating the orientation, reactions, self-assembly, and surface deposition of very cold polar molecules by the application of an external field.  This will be achieved by embedding the molecules into superfluid helium nanodroplets in a beam.  The droplets cool the molecules to sub-Kelvin temperatures without impeding their ability to migrate and rotate freely.  An externally imposed electric field will produce nearly complete molecular alignment.  This novel route to explore and control quantum phenomena will be applied to the following areas: (i) Steering the outcome of molecular reactions and assembly via imposing a mutual orientation on the reactants; (ii) Nanodroplet size selection via electrostatic deflection of droplets doped with polar molecules.   (iii) Soft-landing of aligned polar molecules via application of a directed electric field near a substrate. \r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, quantum-level control of cold and ultracold polar molecule assembly, interactions and reactions has attracted significant interdisciplinary interest in view of their potential value for quantum computing, novel condensate phases, molecular interferometry, and investigations of fundamental symmetries. Potential applications of the deposition technique include production of oriented films and arrays, enhanced optical sensing, etc.  On the human resources side, the project will offer graduate students excellent training in a wide range of experimental and theoretical aspects of an inherently interdisciplinary field.  Postdoctoral researchers will receive professional mentoring.  Commitment to teaching and outreach includes ongoing active undergraduate student involvement in research, as well as contributions to programs and workshops for undergraduate, elementary-school, and high-school students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScientists? drive to understand and control matter extends all the way down to understanding and controlling the behavior of individual molecules.  An important category of control is \"orienting\" one or a group of molecules, i.e., forcing them to point in a desired direction.  Achieving a high degree of orientation can help to measure molecular properties with high precision, or to speed up or slow down reactions, or even to create new states of matter and possibly to design a quantum computer.  To enable and sustain such orientation the molecules must be strongly cooled, which is usually very challenging.  A novel, elegant, and broadly applicable technique for doing this is to embed molecules into nanodroplets of superfluid helium that are flying as a beam inside an evacuated chamber.  Such embedded molecules become cooled to less than half a degree above absolute zero, but also remain capable of rotating freely. \n\n \n\nIn the course of this project we performed a so-called beam deflection experiment in which the droplet beam with embedded molecules passes through a strong non-uniform electric field.  The field orients the molecular \"dopants\" almost completely and at the same time deflects the whole nanodroplet beam sideways.  We found that this deflection reached several millimeters in magnitude, which is an extremely large effect testifying to the great magnitude of the force experienced by the oriented molecules.  Since the helium nanodroplets are rather large, this experiment also may represent the heaviest laboratory molecular beam deflection ever.\n\n \n\nThe finding of exceptionally strong deflection of helium droplets with embedded molecules opens to door to a number of important applications.  For example, this effect can be used to measure the dipole moments (i.e., the distribution of electric charge) of a wide range of molecules, from small all the way to large biological ones, as well as to study solvents at the nanoscale level. It also can be used to detect the formation of unusual molecular agglomerates and to observe the products of reactions proceeding in the quantum regime.\n\n \n\nThe second part of the project involved another very interesting fluid, namely water.  Microscopic droplets (\"clusters\") composed of just a few to a few dozen of water molecules have been investigated in hundreds of research papers.  The reason for such great interest in water clusters is that they help scientists understand the properties of bulk water, of water aerosols and microcrystals in the atmosphere and in interstellar space, as well as of the small confined pools of water that surround biological molecules in all living organisms.\n\n \n\nOne of the main experimental tools in cluster science is mass spectrometry:  clusters are ionized by light or by a beam of electrons and the resulting ions are sorted by size. Unfortunately, it has proven very difficult to ascertain whether, and how much, the ionization breaks up the nanodroplets one is trying to analyze.  The reason is that there has been no easy way to estimate the original masses of the neutral droplet.  We came up with a solution to this puzzle.  By aiming a beam of small molecules at the water cluster beam and measuring the velocity loss of those clusters that captured a molecule, we were able to estimate the original masses and to discover that the droplets do indeed  fragment significantly upon ionization.  These results will enable researchers to achieve a better measure of the true size of particles whose properties they are investigating.  In addition, the same technique can be applied to research involving many other kinds of clusters.\n\n \n\nIn the course of this project, undergraduate and graduate students engaged in important, educational, and collaborative scientific work.  The lead graduate student and the principal investigator received awards for their research.  International contacts and exchanges were established and strengthened.  Highly successful international workshops were organized. The project was accompanied by educational and outreach activity, with group members serving as judges in top-level science fairs and participating in educational workshops.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vitaly V Kresin"
