 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in biodiversity research have led to progress in two separate directions that focus first on how organisms change over time, and second on spatial patterns of biodiversity at a given time. The proposed research brings together these two approaches to understand biodiversity in a dynamic context. Fundamental research questions are: (1) how are the rate and order of diversification in different groups of organisms determined by the community in which they live, and (2) how does the sequence of diversification dictate the resulting community composition?  The research focuses on insects and spiders and uses the known dynamic geology of the young islands of the Hawaiian archipelago, where different contemporary sites represent stages in a geological sequence, as a system for examining feedbacks between adaptation, population divergence, and associated community succession. Methods include: (1) genomic and other molecular tools to measure active diversification of interacting groups of species that are recent arrivals to these novel habitats, and (2) ecological and computational approaches to measure changes in species composition over time.\r\n\r\nThe research will determine the importance of changing roles of species within communities as populations diverge over time and assemble in space, and the role of that dynamic community in fostering diversification. The work also informs applied areas of invasion and conservation biology, and restoration ecology, by testing the importance of priority, sequence, and associated interaction strengths. The project will train multiple undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdocs in research at the intersection between evolutionary biology and ecology.",

Ecological approaches provide an understanding of the immediate factors that shape species diversity and community health, but generally do not accommodate evolutionary change. Evolutionary approaches provide explanations of the behavior of specific lineages over longer timescales.  Our research was part of an effort to merge these ecological and evolutionary approaches by investigating species interactions and communities in an age structured landscape in the Hawaiian Islands. Specifically, our research contribution was conducted within an evolutionary framework.  We used a genomic approach to understand the genetic structure of a species that exists across an age-structured landscape in Hawaii, the importance of volcanic age to the relationships among genetically unique elements within species, and obtained necessary information about unique taxonomic elements in arthropod communities of Hawaiian forests.\n\nIntellectual Merit: Developing approaches and testing hypotheses about the origins and assessment of biodiversity is critical to understanding the natural state of species, which is likewise essential to understanding our negative impact on those species.  Our research has provided a striking and dramatically different insight into a major species component of native Hawaiian forest communities in a temporally structured landscape.  Our work has shown that  (1) arthropod species may show enormous genetic structure across their distributions, suggesting the existence of extensive but hidden biodiversity and specialization across the landscape (in conjuction with the results of other researcher?s in this collaboration); (2) evolutionary dynamics that maintain ecological similarity despite high levels of genetic structuring, all implying; (3) hidden vulnerability of unique evolutionary ecological communities.  During the course of this investigation we also uncovered an alarming and previously unappreciated level of ecological damage caused by invasive species. \n\n Broader Impacts: The broader impact of our work can be understood in the context of our larger collaboration with the Dimensions team.
