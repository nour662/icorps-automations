  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe aim of this project was to study how objects change (and what stays the same) when they are cut up into pieces and glued back together.  For example, any two polygons with the same area can be cut up into pieces and rearranged into one another, but a cube and a regular tetrahedron (even if they have the same volume) cannot.  The original inspiration for this project was the study of geometric rearrangements such as these using techniques from algebraic topology.  However, it quickly turned out that the most fruitful avenue of inquiry was in describing cutting and pasting of algebraic objects called \"varieties.\"\n\nA variety consists of all points at which a set of polynomials (in some number of variables) is zero.  If a variety sits inside another one we can cut out the smaller one and say that the larger variety is \"glued together\" out of the smaller one and the complement of the smaller one.  The question of scissors congruence asks the following: given a variety, what other varieties can be formed by cutting up the pieces and rearranging them?  The classical approach to studying this question is to find some nice \"volume\" function on varieties so that it is preserved by cutting up (just like volume of polyhedra is preserved when polyhedra are cut up into pieces).  Many such different volumes exist, which are useful for different examples.  If two varieties have different volumes (for even one choice of volume function) then one can't possibly be made from the pieces of the other.  For a long time, there was a question that nobody knew how to answer: do there exist varieties such that all of their volumes are the same, but one can't be made out of pieces of the other?\n\nIn December of 2014, Borisov found an example of two such varieties.  In an amazing coincidence, he found this example by looking for a completely different example: an example of two varieties that have different volumes when thought of as polynomials in n variables, but if instead they're thought of as polynomials in (n+1) variables (where the (n+1)-st one happens to not appear) suddenly have the same volumes.  From an algebro-geometric perspective it is completely unclear why these two examples should appear simultaneously.\n\nHowever, when one considers the problem with topological techniques it follows very naturally.  Instead of looking at volume functions, one constructs a nice topological space (a \"shape\" of some kind) such that paths through the shape represent ways of cutting up varieties and rearranging them into one another.  Thus the shape keeps track of both whether it's possible to make one variety out of another, and also the different ways to do it, the same way that a map keeps track of which cities are connected and all of the ways it's possible to get from one to another.  Thus this has more information than just the volume function.  Once this information is taken into account, topological calculations show that all examples of the kind Borisov was looking for are also, simultaneously, examples of varieties that can't be cut into pieces and rearranged into one another.  So it is not the case that Borisov was extremely lucky in his example; any solution that he found would have answered both questions simultaneously.\n\nIn order to find this link, we ended up deloping a general theory of scissors congruence that can be applied in geometry, algebra, logic and other areas.  In the future we hope that we and others can find other applications of this theory that are as fruitful as the appilcation to varieties.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Inna I Zakharevich"
