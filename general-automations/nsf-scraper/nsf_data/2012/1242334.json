 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis workshop, supported by the Division of Materials Research and Division of Chemistry is designed to facilitate underrepresented scientists to compete for assistant professor positions in materials chemistry/engineering and materials science. The workshop targets individuals with training in chemistry, physics, engineering, and biology interested in independent research careers focusing on materials research. The academic focus of this workshop serves to assist underrepresented groups to create support networks. The relationships forged at the workshops facilitate ongoing advocacy for the participants through future phases of their careers. The Future Faculty Workshop (FFW) is now entering its fifth year and the last workshops by every measure have been successful. The first three workshops were funded with purely private sources. However, with the generous support of NSF, the 2011 workshop was expanded and had the largest group yet with 41 attendees and 11 Professor mentors. The FFW organization has largely been performed on an ad hoc basis and has been rotating among a group of highly committed mentors. We have documented the impact in increasing diversity in professorial ranks. However, the challenge of increasing the diversity of the academy remains as a significant problem. As a result, this workshop will therefore be needed for some years to come. The FFW will be further developed over the next three years by engaging different geographic regions and populations of the US beyond the Northeast, where the last 4 workshops were held. A national FFW is expected to not only serve different groups of aspiring academics, but also facilitate interactions with other centers of materials research and stakeholders.\r\n\r\nNON TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis workshop, supported by the Division of Materials Research and Division of Chemistry is designed to facilitate underrepresented scientists to compete for assistant professor positions in materials chemistry/engineering and materials science. One of the greatest challenges to the future of the United States is effectively harnessing our nation's diverse human resources in science and engineering. We will not be competitive without developing future generations from all social, economic and racial backgrounds. In spite of many programs, there continues to be a disproportionately low engagement of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering. It is recognized that getting people interested in science at a young age is important. However, even for those underrepresented minority students who go on to study science, the \"pipeline\" is leaky from the undergraduate to graduate school and on to the professorate. At every stage the proportion of underrepresented minority students progressing to the next level loses ground relative to the majority. Greater representation in the professorship by underrepresented minorities and other disadvantaged groups will be transformational and is one of the most effective ways to enhance diversity in the future science and engineering workforce.",
