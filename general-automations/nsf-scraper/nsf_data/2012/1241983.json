This GRC will be focused on state-of-the-art research in materials science, polymer chemistry, nanocomposites, and biomaterials science and technology. In keeping with the past tradition of this GRC the programmatic themes of this conference cover a range of important and timely topics spanning the range nanostructured polymers, to polymer physics and engineering, to targeted polymer materials for delivery and repair, and the mechanics and assembly of polymer structures. These themes, combined with the diverse array of speakers and attendees, promise a GRC of strong technical merit and broader impact.  The invited speakers are internationally known, world-class experts in their respective areas of polymer synthesis, polymer physics, polymer engineering, nanocomposites, and polymer biomaterials. In addition to the invited talks, poster sessions will offer an exceptional opportunity for scientific discussion in an informal setting, where early career researchers interact with established experts from academia, industry, and government laboratories.  The GRC will be preceded by the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), which will provide a special opportunity for postdoctoral researchers and graduate students to present their latest results and benefit from the feedback and interactions with the other participants of the GRS and GRC.",
