 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit \r\nThe 2nd Penn State Bioinorganic Workshop will be held on the University Park campus of The Pennsylvania State University  from May 31-June 9, 2012.  The proposed workshop aims to provide a complete immersion training experience to students and postdocs.  The field of bioinorganic chemistry is diverse, and includes a wide variety of scientific disciplines, including genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, and physical chemistry. The workshop will include lecture topics, such as, (1) principles of molecular biology; (2) principles of coordination chemistry; (3) principles of quantum chemistry; (4) transient state kinetic methods; (5) EPR spectroscopy; (6) ENDOR/ESEEM spectroscopy; (7) computation of spectroscopic parameters; (8) resonance Raman spectroscopy; (9) X-ray absorption spectroscopy; (10) M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy; (11) magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy); (12) mass spectrometry; (13) isotope effects as mechanistic probes; (14) protein electrochemistry; (15) X-ray crystallography; and (16) biological electron transfer.  In addition, a \"hands-on\" laboratory training aspect is also included.  The following hands-on sessions will be offered: (1) SF-absorption spectroscopy; (2) the FQ method; (3) EPR spectroscopy; (4) M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy; (5) ENDOR/ESEEM spectroscopy; (6) resonance Raman spectroscopy; (7) mass spectrometry ; (8) purification of air-sensitive enzymes; (9) site-directed mutagenesis; (10) protein electrochemistry; and (11) cryoreduction experiments at the Breazeale Nuclear Reactor on the Penn State campus. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nMany areas of this meeting will directly relate to central challenges facing society today.  Fundamental collaborative research in bioinorganic chemistry may provide important insight for rational design of chemical/industrial processes. An example includes the improvement of the Haber Bosch process, a crucial process for modern agriculture, by a better understanding of the enzyme nitrogenase.\r\nThis workshop will make important contributions to training of students and postdocs in bioinorgranics. Approximately 80 young researchers will immerse themselves in a wide variety of methods and concepts central to this research area, thus receiving training that will undoubtedly be broader than they could possibly receive in any one research group.",
