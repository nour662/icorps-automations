 "awd_abstract_narration": "High dimensional data are becoming increasingly available from a wide \r\nrange of scientific investigations, including genomics, bioinformatics, \r\nengineering, and climate studies. Sound analysis of such datasets poses \r\nmany statistical challenges. It calls for new statistical theory and methods \r\nas well as new technical tools. In this collaborative research project, the \r\ninvestigators will first develop results and  technical tools in random matrix \r\ntheory and then take a unified approach using the technical tools developed \r\nto study several important problems in high dimensional statistics \r\nas well as applications in signal processing, physics, and mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe statistical and scientific objectives outlined in this proposal are interdisciplinary \r\nand will establish connections among different fields - random matrix theory, high \r\ndimensional statistics, signal processing, physics, and mathematics. The research \r\nwill also provide technical tools as well as methodology, to researchers in other \r\nscientific fields who collect and analyze high dimensional data. These include, \r\nbut are not limited to, genomics, biostatistics, and electrical engineering. The procedures and algorithms developed in this project will be implemented and softwares developed will be made freely and publicly available on the web as open source\r\ncode along with the associated research reports so as to facilitate the dissemination of knowledge.",
