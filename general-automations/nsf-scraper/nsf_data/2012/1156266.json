 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of two sub-projects, each of which aims at developing new tools for econometric analysis. The first proposes a practical procedure for moment condition models. Moment condition models have been extensively studied over the last few decades, though relatively little is known as to how to estimate them using the Bayesian approach, which is convenient if one wishes to incorporate prior beliefs into her analysis.\r\nThere exist at least two significant challenges associated with applications of the Bayesian approach to moment condition models. First, a flexible way to express one's beliefs needs to be used. Second, a general moment condition model induces complicated interdependence across unknown parameters that are being estimated. This project proposes a new approach to address them. It is applicable in many areas across diverse disciplines, since moment condition models are fundamental to general statistical analysis.\r\nThe second sub-project proposes econometric tools for analyzing economic rationality while taking account of heterogeneity across individuals. In particular, it empirically examines the concept of stochastic rationality, which has been considered in various branches of economics and psychology. The empirical content of stochastic rationality is expressed in terms of a high dimensional system of inequalities stated in an indirect manner. This feature poses challenges both theoretically and computationally, and a set of novel econometric methods are proposed to overcome them.\r\nAdditionally, these methods provide means to conduct policy analysis without imposing arbitrary assumptions. This has direct implications for evaluation of actual economic policies. Both sub-projects will produce computer programs for the proposed procedures, and they will be made available to the public at no costs. Also, the proposed activities are expected to provide educational benefits to students through research assistantships supported by the grant.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis proposal yielded the following outcomes:\n\n(1) The project on nonparametric random utility models has shown that it is possible to carry out tests of various choice axioms, and more importantly, calculate counterfacturals without relying on ad hoc assumptions.  That is, this project is free from parametric assumptions, and it even avoids smoothness assumptions, which are commonly used in standard nonparametric methods.  This is crucially important since economic theory usually does not predict any implications in terms of parametric forms or smoothness.  The proposed method therefore enables researchers and policymakers to directly focus on what economic theory tells us, and not ad hoc aspects of model specifications and assumptions.\n\nAn important fact to note is that this flexibility is also associated with practical advantages.  By avoiding parametric forms and smoothness assumptions, interesting and somewhat unexpectedly, the project rewrites economic restrictions in terms of linear-quadratic problems.  Due to recent advances in computational methods, such problems can be solved quickly, reliably and accurately using modern computers, as opposed to relying on highly nonlinear optimization, which is often extremely hard to solve in a reliable way even in a moderate degree of dimensions.\n\n(2) The project on nonparametric Bayes method has shown how to carry out fully Bayesian inference of moment condition models.  Bayes approaches are playing increasingly important roles in economics for various reasons including their computational advantages.  Nevertheless, to this date, very few fully Bayesian procedures are available for general, overidentified moment condition models (except for a few methods that appeared, apparently stimulated by the proposal developed in this project).  The project has developed powerful algorithms that are easy to implement and fast to converge to conduct nonparametric Bayesian inference.  An important advantage of our fully Bayesian procedure is its numerical stability, in comparison to other classical and pseudo-Bayesian counterparts.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yuichi Kitamura"
