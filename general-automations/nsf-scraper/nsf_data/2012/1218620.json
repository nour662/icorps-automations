 "awd_abstract_narration": "In some combinatorial optimization problems, the resulting solution\r\nmay violate some constraints provided the cost of finding the solution\r\nis significantly reduced. Such problems are called soft constraints\r\nproblems. In hard constraints problems, an acceptable solution cannot\r\nviolate any of the constraints. Hard constraints versions of many\r\nproblems have resisted satisfactory solutions as compared to the\r\ncorresponding problems with soft constraints. The goal of\r\nthis project is to study combinatorial optimization problems with hard\r\ncapacity constraints.  \r\n\r\nThe PIs will be focusing on hard capacity versions of network design\r\nand facility location problems. These problems have applications in\r\nnetworking and resource allocation and are among the central problems\r\nin combinatorial optimization. As it has happened often in the past,\r\nthe PIs believe that techniques developed for solving these problems\r\nwill have broader impact in solving other combinatorial problems. \r\n\r\nTraining and fostering undergraduate as well as high school students\r\nis a major emphasis of the broader impact of the proposed project.\r\nThe PIs' prior work with undergraduates have led to very good career\r\nopportunities for many of them. The PIs will continue working with\r\nstudents at Rutgers-Camden, fostering their raw talent and helping\r\nthem discover their own potential.  The PIs will also continue working\r\nwith high school students, giving them exposure to theoretical\r\ncomputer science and working on research with some of them.",
