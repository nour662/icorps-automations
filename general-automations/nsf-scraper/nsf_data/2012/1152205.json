 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research group of Professor Myers of Harvard University to develop new methods for the facile construction of complex molecules in the laboratory.  This research focuses on three areas: 1) the investigation of scope and utility of a new auxiliary for asymmetric synthesis; 2) the development of new methods for the synthesis of substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines and isoquinolines; and 3) the development of storable reagents for alkene labeling in aqueous media.  New transformations that form carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bonds with absolute stereo-chemical control will be investigated.  The products proposed for synthesis have great promise for potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry and may provide new ligand platforms for metal-catalyzed transformations.  The discovery of new transformations in synthetic chemistry has inherent intellectual merit, as well as practical application. Frequently, new methods in synthetic organic chemistry lead to new understanding of basic reaction mechanisms or to the development of completely new views of chemical reactivity, and initiate cycles of further discovery and insight. \r\n\r\nThe research is by design of practical nature, thus, it is conceivable that innovations from the work might find industrial application, such as in fine-chemical or pharmaceutical product synthesis. Developments in synthetic organic chemistry have tremendous benefit to society.  Basic research in the field of chemical synthesis is necessary to provide scientists from all areas the tools that they need to rapidly and reliably construct new molecular structures, for any conceivable purpose.  Potential applications include the discovery of new pharmaceutical agents, agricultural products, and materials, as well as the development of more efficient and/or environmentally beneficial industrial processes.  This research will also provide training for graduate students, preparing them for careers in academia and chemical industries.",
