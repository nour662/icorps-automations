All of the conference topics are central to analysis and are active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.",

This Conference provides a vital international forum for mathematicians and scientists working in the ever growing field of analysis and applied analysis, including dynamical systems, differential equations, and real-world applications.  Each conference takes place in a different region of the world to benefit most people.  The following five features make the Conference unique and outstanding. \n \n (1) Its high quality and broad coverage so that each participant can find numerous stimulating talks to match his/her interest; (2) its well-organized symposia that are participated by most of the leading experts of the world in the chosen areas; (3) its capacity of arranging each conference to take place in a different region to benefit most people; (4) its organizer, AIMS, which is backed by thousands of supporters, with its proceedings published by AIMS; and (5) its financial support for a broad participation by young researchers and graduate students.\n\n\n The 9th AIMS International Conference on Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations and Applications took place at the Hyatt Grand Cypress Resort in Orlando, Florida, July 1-5, 2012.
