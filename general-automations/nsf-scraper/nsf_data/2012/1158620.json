 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hidden Light of Antarctica is a photographic project that will explore the visual effects of ultraviolet and infrared light waves on the landscape of Antarctica. Since ultraviolet and infrared light waves are outside the visible spectrum, these photographs will reveal ?hidden? light. The artist will collaborate with an atmospheric chemist who is developing a long-term record of boundary-layer ozone flux through the investigation of bromine compounds in the Ross Island region. She will compare her photographs taken daily with the data results collected by the scientist and her team to determine if the daily ozone fluctuation can be perceived visually. Combined, these diverse approaches to the exploration of ozone depletion, global warming, and climate change will bring fresh perspectives and expanded insights to these subjects. The resulting images will have their own aesthetic qualities with a direct connection to science that will make them unique. This project will result in a series of photographs, a monograph, and an installation.",
