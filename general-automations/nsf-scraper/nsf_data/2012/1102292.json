 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an exciting time in our quest to understand neutrinos -- fundamental particles that play key roles in the early universe, in cosmology and astrophysics, and in nuclear and particle physics. Results from neutrino oscillation experiments have provided compelling evidence that neutrinos have mass and give the first indication that the Standard Model of nuclear and particle physics is incomplete. With the realization that neutrinos are massive, there is an increased interest in investigating their intrinsic properties. Understanding the neutrino mass generation mechanism, the neutrino character (Majorana or Dirac), the absolute neutrino mass scale, and the neutrino mass spectrum are some of the main focuses of the immediate future's neutrino experiments. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this award is based on the fact that a sensitive search for the neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay is the only practical way to determine if neutrinos are Majorana particles (their own antiparticles). This exotic decay is the most sensitive test of lepton-number conservation, which is an important symmetry in elementary particle physics. With the goal of ultimately realizing a 1-tonne scale neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay experiment using Germanium (Ge) detectors, the Majorana collaboration is assembling a prototype referred to as the Demonstrator that is intended to confirm that background levels low enough to justify such a large experiment can be reached. The baseline plan for the Demonstrator is for 15 kg of Ge detectors fabricated from Ge enriched in the double-beta isotope 76-Ge. Because most of the cost of such an experiment is the apparatus associated with it and not enriched Ge, and because one can increase the mass of instrumented 76-Ge significantly without increasing that base cost, there is the opportunity to \"increase\" the physics reach of the project for a reasonable, incremental additional cost. This award provides support for extra Ge detectors fabricated from enriched material to improve the physics reach.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The technology of larger, lower-background HPGe arrays developed from a tonne-scale experiment can be expected to enable a new generation of highly efficient, ultra-low-background gamma spectroscopy measurements. Among the fields that stand to benefit from this new generation of technology are: direct dark matter searches; measurements for environmental monitoring; atmospheric, ocean, and groundwater environmental transport; methods of radioactive dating; reactor monitoring; bioassay for determining very low occupational exposures to radiation; and biological studies involving radiotracers at very low activities. An E&O program with the Morehead Planetarium on the campus of U. of North Carolina will bring underground science to the public.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNeutrinos are amongst the most abundant fundamental particles in the universe, yet understanding their exact nature has proven to be a most difficult experimental challenge.  Determining these properties provides insight into our basic understanding of fundamental interactions and their role in the universe. Recent revolutionary measurements of neutrinos from the sun and from neutrinos created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere found the surprising result that neutrinos have non-zero masses, in disagreement with the long-held existing \"standard model\" of fundamental interactions. (Two of these pioneering experiments were co-awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.)\nThe fact that neutrinos are not massless, has opened the possibility to search for a long postulated rare decay process known as \"neutrinoless double beta decay\".  If observed this would prove that neutrinos are their own anti-particles (unlike all spin 1/2 electrically charged fundamental particles where the particle and anti-particles are distinct particles).  Such a discovery would have profound implications, not only showing neutrinos are Majorana particles, but demonstrating that a fundamental symmetry of nature known as lepton number is violated, while also allowing one to precisely \"weigh\" (determine the mass of) neutrinos.\nNeutrinoless double beta decay experiments use the atomic nucleus as an exquisitely sensitive laboratory to search for this postulated extremely rare process.  As illustrated in Figure 1, beta decay is the process where within an unstable atomic nucleus a neutron changes to a proton while emitting an electron and a neutrino.  Likewise, there are a few unstable nuclei with the special property that they cannot beta-decay, but where it is possible to have what is known as two neutrino double beta decay, where two neutrons change to two protons while emitting two electrons and two neutrinos.  This rare process has been observed in about a dozen or more different nuclei.  The even more elusive decay mode known as neutrinoless double beta decay, where two neutrons change to two protons while emitting two electrons but zero neutrinos has not yet been observed.  However experiments around the world are actively searching for this postulated decay.\nThe MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR has been constructed to search for neutrinoless double beta decay using the atomic nucleus, 76Ge.  The support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) allowed the procurement of material enriched to 88% in 76Ge from which high purity germanium (HPGe) diodes were fabricated.  These HPGe detectors act as both a source of double beta decay and as a detector of the ionizing radiation from the decay. See Figure 2 for strings of these detectors being mounted into a cryostat.  The NSF also partially supported the construction of the Demonstrator array, which was jointly funded by the Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Science and the NSF.   \nThe immense challenge of looking for such a rare decay mode is that one must go to extraordinary lengths to reduce all possible backgrounds.  Currently, the best limits on neutrinoless double beta decay find half lives of greater than 1025 years.  It is difficult to put such numbers into context, but roughly this would correspond to about 500 decays per year for a ton of material.  The aim is to limit backgrounds to a few decays per year per ton of material.\nConstruction of the DEMONSTRATOR is complete and the array is collecting data a mile underground at the Sanford Research Facility in Lead, SD (see Figure 3).  The preliminary background measurements show that the collaboration has met its initial stringent background goals, which indicates that 76Ge is a viable candidate for a future ton scale neutrinoless double beta decay experiment.  A larger experiment will be needed if the current experiments do not observe the decay.  Such a future experiment has been recommended in the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee?s 2015 Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science.\nA final, very tangible outcome from NSF support of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, is that it provided ideal training for undergraduate and graduate students that will become the next generation of scientists and engineers.  The complex state-of-the-art technologies utilized by the experiment provided an ideal platform our young citizens to be trained to compete in an increasing global, technology driven economy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/17/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John F Wilkerson"
