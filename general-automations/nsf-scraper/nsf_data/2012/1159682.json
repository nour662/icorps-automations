It covers investigation of the band offsets for different dielectrics (SiNX, Sc2O3 and (CeTb)MgAl11O19) on crystalline ZnO, CdZnO, ZnMgO and also for the latter two on a-IGZO and measurement of interface state densities and thermal stability of all these dielectrics on a-IGZO. Optical and electrical techniques are used to characterize the band offsets, bandgaps and interface state densities.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description: Crystalline and amorphous electronic oxides are gaining interest for gas and chemical sensing, ultra violet light-emitting diodes for solid state lighting, flat-panel, flexible and touch-screen displays and solar cells. The importance of transparent conducting oxides in these products has led to a surge of research in recent years to discover new materials, lower the costs of manufacture and improve properties. Oxide-based thin film transistors have great potential for realizing a roll-to-roll display. If this can be realized, it may also create new applications in heads-up displays, windshields, electronic books or light weight computers and eventually change the entire display industry.  This project is designed to develop a new class of solid-state materials that can be made at low temperatures, allowing their use on cheap substrates like paper and plastic.   In addition, cross-disciplinary education activities introduce the public to these exotic and enabling materials. The PI engages in undergraduate and graduate mentoring, K-12 outreach, conference symposia organization, and writing a textbook.",
