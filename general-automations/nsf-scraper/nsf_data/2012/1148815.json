 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wide-scale deployment of wireless sensor networks has been hindered primarily by the inability to endure for long durations on small power sources.  The focus of this project is on creating computationally efficient electronics to extend the lifetimes of wireless sensor nodes.  Ultra-low-power analog circuitry is used to provide additional computational resources at each sensor node while simultaneously reducing the total power consumed.  This project systematically addresses how to effectively use analog signal processing in a wide variety of wireless sensor network applications by investigating (1) the creation of modifiable, easy-to-use smart-sensor architectures for ultra-low-power computation, (2) continuous-time signal-processing approaches for event-detection systems (including biologically inspired processing), and (3) ultra-low-power memory storage and data conversion techniques.  \r\n\r\nThe importance of this research is in providing the knowledge necessary to create drastically improved nodes for wireless sensor networks in terms of power consumption and computational ability.  The same low-power design techniques can be used for a variety of other power-constrained applications such as consumer electronics and biomedical/implantable devices.  Integrating education and outreach with the research of this project will lead to (1) close mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students in a team-centric environment, (2) cross-disciplinary coursework, and (3) high-school outreach activities to expose many new students, including those from underrepresented groups, to engineering and electronic systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith battery-powered sensing devices becoming more prevalent in our lives, power consumption has become of paramount importance.  Conventional electronic systems digitize all sensor information prior to processing it.  However, this practice often wastes significant amounts of power by digitizing information that is not relevant to the task at hand.  Alternatively, analog circuitry has been shown to be extremely power efficient and capable of performing complex signal-processing tasks.  We have shown that adding analog circuitry prior to digitization can help to save significant amounts of power by intelligently selecting what information to digitize.  However, analog circuit design has long been considered difficult to design, inaccurate, and inflexible, whereas digital circuitry has been dominant in electronics due to its perceived ease of use, accuracy, versatility, and abundance of general-purpose architectures.\n\nIn this work, we developed a reconfigurable analog processor that is capable of bringing many of the desirable traits of digital processing to the analog domain.  Specifically, this system leverages floating-gate transistors, which are the core elements of digital flash memory, in an analog fashion to create high-precision analog non-volatile memory.   We utilized these devices to program the parameters of a variety of analog building blocks which can then be connected in any desired configuration to perform sophisticated tasks.  We then developed a platform that combines this reconfigurable analog processor with a digital microcontroller and a radio to simplify its use in wireless sensor networks and Internet-of-Things applications.  We also created a software infrastructure to greatly simply the process of designing analog circuitry, even for the non-expert.  Furthermore, we demonstrated the use of these systems within various applications, including a Parkinson's Disease detector, a heart-rate monitoring system, and a vehicle-classification system.\n\nAdditionally, we developed a hands-on educational program based upon this reconfigurable platform.  We incorporated a high-school student, numerous undergraduate research projects, and graduate students into designing low-power sensing and classification applications with the reconfigurable analog processor.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David W Graham"
