 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding establishes a new CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates\r\n(REU) site at Utah State University.  The project, called\r\nBug Wars, exposes students to research on software testing and AI\r\nplanning through both competition and collaboration.  This project will\r\ncreate new knowledge about user-session-based testing, model-based\r\ntesting with AI planning, and the combination of these two techniques\r\nas applied to web applications.   A novel feature of this REU is that\r\nit encourages both competition and collaboration. The students initially\r\nsplit into two teams that strive to find the most faults in web application\r\nsystems under test. One team collects, reduces, and prioritizes\r\nuser-session-based test suites. A second team uses machine learning to\r\nbuild models of the software and AI planning to generate test suites.\r\nStudents compete to show the merits of their approach on the same systems\r\nby considering the sizes and fault detection effectiveness of their\r\ntest suites.  The students then critically discuss their work and propose\r\ncombining the different approaches to further improve effectiveness.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are that twenty-four students over a\r\nthree-year period have the opportunity to participate in a supportive\r\nenvironment that encourages them to pursue graduate studies in Computer\r\nScience. The students are better prepared for graduate school as they gain\r\nbasic research skills, including the formulation of research questions,\r\ndesign of experiments, critical evaluation, and written and oral\r\ncommunication.",
