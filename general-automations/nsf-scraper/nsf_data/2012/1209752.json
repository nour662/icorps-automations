 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Scott N. Schiffres of Carnegie Mellon University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Nano-sized particles to enhance heat transfer in melting-freezing with applications to solar thermal energy storage,\" during the summer of 2012 at the University of Tokyo in Hongo, Tokyo, Japan.  The host scientists are Shigeo Maruyama and Junichiro Shiomi.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the study of how nano-sized particles, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, influence thermal conductivity in materials undergoing phase-change.  A metal coated fiber 3-omega technique is being used to characterize thermal conductivity of the phase-change material with nano-sized particles in addition to characertizing other aspects of the nano-sized particle suspension.  One application of this research is to understand how nano-particles may enhance heat transfer during melting and freezing, allowing for enhanced thermal storage and reduced energy usage.  \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
