 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modifications of DNA without any change to the sequence of genes known as epigenetic effects, play important roles in gene expression and allow an organism to adapt to its environment.  In the nervous system these non-coding changes to DNA, such as addition of a methyl group,  can affect behavior and learning.  In the honey bee it was found that aggressive behavior shows a paternal effect, suggesting that some genes inherited from the father are expressed at a different level than genes that are inherited from the mother possibly due to modifications of the DNA.  It has been theorized that parent-of-origin effects on gene expression may be more common in social insects because families have one mother and many fathers, and these effects may play a role in many social behaviors in honey bees.  This project will use sequencing of gene products in families of bees from specific genetic crosses to determine which honey bee genes have expression that is influenced by whether they are inherited from the mother or the father.  The results will aid in the identification of genes that influence specific behaviors such as aggression and provide a better understanding of epigenetic processes in animals. Honey bees are important pollinators for our food crops and a greater understanding of honey bee behavior is important to apiculture. Additionally this project will train a postdoctoral researcher, undergraduate and graduate students in cutting edge genetic techniques thus producing future researchers for this important beneficial insect. Information will also be provided to the public through websites and the popular press.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn African race of honey bees was introduced into Brazil in 1956 and has spread northward as far as the southern U.S. In comparson to European races commonly used in beekeeping, \"Africanized\" bees are highly aggressive.  The number of stings from colonies of hybrid honey bees (European by Africanized crosses) depends on which race is used as the father.  Hybrid colonies with Africanized fathers sting much more than hybrids with European paternity, and equal to the African lineage hives. This project was designed to investigate whether the asymmetry between hybrid families for aggression was caused by differential expression of parental genes (alleles) in the hybrids.  We found that the asymmetry in behavior was also present at the individual level. Isolated hybrid workers and queens with Africanized fathers sting faster than the reciprocal hybrids. This was true for hybrids derived from two different European races tested.  Sequencing the total pool of gene transcripts in worker bees was conducted and parental alleles were identified by sequence differences, allowing us to measure expression of both maternal and paternal genes. \n\n \n\nSurprisingly, we found that 8% of genes tested were expressing primarily the maternal allele in hybrids with Africanized paternity, but not in the reciprocal hybrids with European paternity. This same asymmetric pattern was found in all three samples analyzed: whole larvae, adults and individual brains of worker bees.  This reflects the asymmetry in behavior and suggests that interactions between maternally-inherited mitochondrial genes and nuclear genes can have a big effect on allele-specific expression in all life stages and tissues.  The maternally biased genes were mostly dispersed through the 16 bee chromosomes but two clusters were identified in which all of the genes were maternally biased.  We previously discovered that these two chromosomal regions influence stinging behavior or alarm pheromone production.  Overall, the maternally biased gene set was enriched for mitochondrial proteins, genes involved in metabolism and genes involved in the piwi-RNA silencing pathway.  It was recently shown that aggression in honey bees is caused in part by a shift in brain carbohydrate metabolism from OXPHOS to aerobic glycolysis. These biased genes may be influencing that shift.  Silencing some metabolic gene(s) inherited from an Africanized father may influence aggression in his daughters, causing a shift towards glycolytic metabolism.  Higher aggression of daughter queens should increase their success in queen duels. Honey bee queens fight to the death when they meet. The same effect would explain why commercial European colonies in areas with Africanized drones become so aggressive when they requeen themselves and the daughter queen mates with African-lineage drones.  We hypothesize that the mechanisms behind the asymmetric parental effects on aggression involve nuclear-mitochondrial interactions, small interfering RNAs and chromatin modifications of paternal chromosomes.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts.  This project answered a longstanding question: why does the aggressive behavior of honey bee shows non-Mendelian inheritance?  These results have relevance to honey bee biology but also further develops the honey bee as a model for studying epigenetic and physiological effects on aggression in a broader context because a shift towards glycolytic metabolism has also been linked to aggression in humans and other animals.\n\n \n\nThis project helped to develop the careers of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers and gave them experience in presenting results orally and in publications, while also involving them in international collaboration.  The project has generated biological samples that may enable the mechanisms of epigenetic effects on aggression to be precisely determined.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Greg Hunt"
