It seeks to help STEM scholars and their students to benefit from careers in STEM.  The project conducts this work through two face-to-face meetings, continuous online discussions, and ongoing group interactions via social networks. It uses 25 STEM scholars to review and discuss existing and future research. Participants work collaboratively to: (1) develop a forum where interdisciplinary teams share knowledge, devise agendas and action items that lead to broadening understanding and pragmatic solutions for traditionally underserved students to enter and persist in STEM fields; and  (2) disseminate results from dialogues and group actions to various audiences.\r\n\r\nThe research workgroups synthesize and disseminate research articles, best practices, and evidence-based culturally relevant programs that chart new directions, challenge deficit thinking, and promote greater interest and participation in STEM. The project benefits from ongoing partnerships with representatives from the United Negro College Fund, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, National Urban League, National Society of Black Engineers, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, and the After-School Corporation that have agreed to contribute to this effort. The lead institutions establish contact with media organizations that target STEM scholars, which can assist with project dissemination.  A five-member advisory board helps guide and inform the project.",
