 "awd_abstract_narration": "CLEAR Scholars in Engineering is an S-STEM program for undergraduate engineering students in the School of Engineering and Technology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI).  Each year up to 12 economically-disadvantaged and academically-prepared rising sophomore students are selected as CLEAR scholars. The program provides support to this diverse population of urban students from the sophomore year through graduation, with the goal of decreasing time spent in extracurricular employment, time to graduation, and indebtedness upon graduation; and increasing engagement with high-impact practices for academic and post-degree success. Leveraging existing academic and support services, CLEAR Scholars participate in a set of activities that promote retention, achievement, and persistence to graduation through: community-building through a cohort model; leadership and career development; engagement with industry; advising through mentoring; and resources for academic success. This program connects scholars who have similar financial challenges, and who share educational and career aspirations to help them integrate more fully into the academic culture through mentoring, leadership and career development, and other activities that support student success. The sophomore level is chosen as the point of intervention because students will have already completed freshman-level engineering coursework, demonstrating preparedness for engineering study as well as a continued need for academic, social, and financial support. The program actively engages campus and community stakeholders, including school administrators, faculty, and industry partners.  Lessons learned from CLEAR Scholars inform other initiatives to improve the undergraduate experience for all engineering students at IUPUI.",

CLEAR Scholars remain in the program through their sophomore, junior, and senior years, provided they remain in engineering and maintain a GPA of at least 2.5.&nbsp; Fourteen students have participated in CLEAR Scholars since its inception in 2012, and all but one of those Scholars has successfully graduated from an undergraduate engineering program at IUPUI.</p>\n<p>CLEAR Scholars met monthly during the fall and spring semesters for activities that connect them to academic and career development resources, as well as helping them develop relationships with one another and with the CLEAR Scholars coordinator (Figure 1).&nbsp; <em>Resources for Success Workshops</em> include presentations from on-campus academic support programs, such as the Math Assistance Center; as well as activities that reinforce habits for success and self-efficacy.&nbsp; <em>Academic Reflections</em> give Scholars an opportunity to reflect on their most recent semester and to analyze what went well and what they might do differently going forward.&nbsp; It also gives more advanced students in the cohort a chance to mentor younger students, which both helps younger Scholars succeed academically and strengthens the social bonds of the cohort.&nbsp; Scholars consistently rate these opportunities to get to know and learn from one another as among their favorite aspects of CLEAR Scholars.</p>\n<p>A key feature of CLEAR Scholars is engagement with both campus and industry partners to provide programming and opportunities to our Scholars.&nbsp; Through <em>Career Development Workshops</em>, the Engineering and Technology Career Services Office provides both regular presentations about their services and one-on-one professional development including r&eacute;sum&eacute; review and mock interviews.&nbsp; Scholars are connected with Career Services upon entering the program as sophomores and are encouraged to take advantage of their services throughout their time in the program.&nbsp; In addition, industrial partners &ndash; including members of the Dean&rsquo;s Industrial Advisory Council (DIAC) for the School of Engineering and Technology &ndash; provide <em>Leadership Development Workshops</em> to Scholars on effective leadership techniques, workplace expectations, and other topics of interest, as well as opportunities for job shadowing and site visits to local industries that hire engineers.</p>\n<p>Perhaps as a result of this focus on preparing students for workplace success, one of our most significant outcomes is that CLEAR Scholars are significantly more likely to pursue credit-bearing industrial internship and co-op experiences compared to the average IUPUI engineering student.&nbsp; 50% of students participating in CLEAR scholars completed at least one semester of industrial internship or co-op in an engineering-related role for credit, compared to only about 5% of all engineering majors at IUPUI (Figure 2).&nbsp; We hypothesize that the CLEAR Scholars enter the program already interested in career development opportunities &ndash; hence their interest in the CLEAR Scholars program &ndash; and that the program&rsquo;s emphasis on connecting Scholars to career resources helps them proactively pursue opportunities of interest.&nbsp; Expanding our count to include not only credit-bearing industrial internships, but also industrial internships that did not result in college credit and both for-credit and not-for-credit undergraduate research opportunities, 12 out of 14 CLEAR Scholars (86%) spent at least one semester or summer prior to graduation engaged in experiential learning directly related to their major, significantly more than the average for engineering (Figure 2).&nbsp; 13 out of 14 students who participated in the program successfully completed an engineering degree, and all remain in engineering-related fields after graduation (Figure 3).&nbsp; Two Scholars were able to use the financial support from CLEAR Scholars to budget for summer classes and graduate earlier than anticipated, thus reducing their overall financial burden.&nbsp; Thus, the CLEAR Scholars program has shown success in retaining and graduating engineering students, preparing them for post-graduation roles in STEM fields, and helping them reduce their financial burdens.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/16/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Karen&nbsp;Alfrey</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1153850/1153850_10163749_1531771004290_S_STEM_Fig1_MeetingActivityTable--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1153850/1153850_10163749_1531771004290_S_STEM_Fig1_MeetingActivityTable--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: Monthly Cohort Meeting Activities\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1153850/1153850_10163749_1531771004290_S_STEM_Fig1_MeetingActivityTable--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Monthly Cohort Meeting Activities\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CLEAR Scholars met monthly during the academic year for workshops and other activities promoting their academic and professional success.
