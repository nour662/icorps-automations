 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work provides a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster at Prairie View A&M University to support a broad array of multidisciplinary computing-intensive research and research training.\r\nThe proposed cluster features Ethernet ports connection between nodes, shared network storage and massive parallel computation on graphics processor cores. Moreover, the on board Gigabit Ethernet ports with switch connection can support large data sets transmission to enable the research in real time multimedia network simulation.\r\n\r\nDemonstrating compressive sensing (CS) on real time multi-view video application requires considerable computational capability but is critical for surveillance camera and sensor networks.  The impacts are nontrivial in homeland security applications especially on the battlefield where sensors and hand-held radios are mobile. Video sensors detect physical properties and rapidly transmit the data to a command control center for remote executable actions. A High Performance Computing cluster makes it possible to explore parallel processing of CS sampling and rendering and the Prairie View cluster is ideally suited for high-speed, parallel video processing in the research of these applications. This cluster enables new research in simulating cognitive radio networks with more complicated situations The real time simulation will help not only understanding how real time processing affects the cognitive radio applications, but also designing algorithms for applications in real world environment. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research includes the integration of research and education. The most direct and immediate impact is that research data, source code, and curriculum materials obtained from the research projects supported by this HPC cluster are freely accessible across the research communities. Strengthening the real time multimedia signal reconstruction, analysis and modeling research impacts homeland security needs and efficient usage of network resources.  Additionally, the development of new courses, expanded research experiences for Graduate and undergraduate students, and outreach to high school and middle school students are an integral part of planned use of the Prairie View HPC Cluster.\r\n",
