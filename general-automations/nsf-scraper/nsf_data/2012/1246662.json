 "awd_abstract_narration": "The performance site for this LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is California State University, Los Angeles, one of the 22 California State University campuses included in the California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU-LSAMP). The project  provides a Master's level \"bridge\" to doctoral-level study for a cohort of 12 graduates of LSAMP undergraduate programs.  The Master's-level experience is designed to increase participant persistence and competencies in STEM and their advancement to Ph.D. programs following completion of the Master's degree.  In addition to providing substantial financial support to enable students to focus full time on a two-year program of Master's-level course work and research, the project provides an integrated set of activities designed to advance BD students toward completion of doctoral level studies.  Activities include: (1) quarterly meetings with the Lead Project Director to monitor progress; (2) a workshop series focused on information needed for adjustment to and success in graduate school; (3) writing support; (4) weekly professional seminars; (5) community building activities; (6) \"connecting\" BD Fellows to doctoral programs; and (7) assistance with applications to Ph.D. programs, financial aid and fellowships.\r\n\r\nThe project will contribute to advancing the NSF's FY 2011-2016 Strategic Plan, which aims to: \"Prepare and engage a diverse STEM workforce motivated to participate at the frontiers.\"  The project will increase the number of Ph.D. level scientists by identifying and developing the talent of students who would be unlikely to pursue graduate-level study at either the Master's or the doctorate level without the project's support.  These include students with deficits in their baccalaureate credentials and others with competitive credentials for direct entry into Ph.D. programs, but who are otherwise unable or hesitant to do so.  Since the pool of LSAMP baccalaureate recipients includes a high proportion of individuals from underrepresented minority groups, the project anticipates that most, if not all of participants will be students from these groups.  Therefore, the project will contribute significantly to broadening participation in academe and science research.",
