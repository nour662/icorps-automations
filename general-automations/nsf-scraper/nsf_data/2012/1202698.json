 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Douglas Watson is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Chicago.  A longstanding problem in astrophysics is to understand how galaxies form.  Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation is to study how satellite galaxies relate to the dark matter subhalos in which they reside.  Uncovering this connection provides a wealth of information about galaxy formation and hierarchical structure formation in the Universe.  Satellite galaxies lead chaotic lives, yet an understanding of their spatial distribution gives clues into the relationship between the light and dark sides of the Universe. \r\n\r\nIn this project the fellow will focus on two principal aspects of galaxy formation theory that seek to shed light on the fate of satellite galaxies:  First, there is a strong luminosity trend of the radial density profile of satellite galaxies such that bright satellites are poor tracers of the dominant, underlying dark matter.  However, what is physically responsible for driving this result remains unclear.  The fellow will seek to incorporate high resolution dark matter N-body simulations that will be able to resolve subhalos down to the very small scales of interest.  Since satellite galaxies are believed to reside within subhalos, a detailed investigation of the spatial distribution of subhalos is crucial towards testing the concordance Lambda Cold Dark Matter model at the extreme small scales.  Second, the fellow will investigate a new technique to use the spatial clustering of satellite galaxies to understand how their stellar mass loss occurs.  Understanding how satellite galaxies can lose stellar mass can yield direct predictions for the amount of diffuse intrahalo light (IHL) at varying scales and may prove invaluable for providing insight into the physics of galaxy formation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  One way to invigorate the general public and the next generation of great scientists is for astronomers to convey complex ideas with inspiration and clarity.  The fellow will take a two-part approach to this endeavor: (1) improving public outreach efforts at the Adler Planetarium, and (2) training K-12 Chicago public school teachers in acquiring the skills to effectively teach science (astronomy in particular) to underserved, minority students.  The first part involves the fellow developing new visualizations and engaging narratives for use in interactive presentations with museum visitors at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago.  In the second part the fellow will help to construct and implement a new professional development workshop for teachers with a focus on astronomy.  The experience with the Adler presentations will help inform the fellow on effective methods for taking astronomy into the classroom.  The teaching workshop will not only allow teachers direct exposure to real scientists and the scientific method, but it will also assess the ability of astronomers to galvanize the underserved youth to pursue career paths in science.  This activity will help enable teachers to inspire students to pursue careers in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGalaxies are beacons of light in the vast darkness of space.  They contain billions, even trillions, of stars, and the light the stars emit allows galaxies act as \"cosmic lighthouses\" for astronomers.  A galaxy will start out bursting with newly forming stars; such young, bright stars emit blue light.  Older galaxies appear red in color as their starlight fades over time.  Astronomers have studied millions of galaxies and we know their colors (i.e., the rate at which they are forming stars), and hence, roughly their ages.\n\nWe also now know that visible matter only makes up about 15% of the matter content in the Universe.  The rest is the ever-elusive \"dark matter\".  Dark matter coagulates into massive clumps (via simple Newtonian gravity), and these so-call \"dark matter halos\" are the natural cites for galaxies to form and evolve.  However, the details of galaxy evolution are extremely complicate and poorly understood. \n\nIn my NSF AAPF proposal I put forth an ambition scientific research proposal: to \"shed light\" on the cosmic history of galaxies.  The outcome was far better than I had imagined.  A fellow postdoctoral researcher and I wrote down a theory that connected colors and star formation rates of galaxies (which, remember, are proxies for their age) to the formation and evolution of the dark matter halos they lived in.  So we simply postulated that by finding a scheme that matched galaxies (things we actually observe) to halos (things we simulate via supercomputers), we could create fake realizations of the observed Universe.

Furthermore, our \"age matching\" theory is now the gold standard in galaxy formation theory and has spawned numerous workshops and conferences on the ramifications of this new picture. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas F Watson"
