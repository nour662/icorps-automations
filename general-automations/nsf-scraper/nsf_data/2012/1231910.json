 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThe idea of molecular electronics is usually stated in terms of miniaturization, scaling, and the difficulties of extending silicon technologies. Aside from digital logic, however, molecule-based architectures could also be novel transducers of chemical activity.  For example, single molecule electronic devices might be used to merge solid state electronics with the dynamic behavior of constituent biomolecules.  This novel repurposing might be the most transformative and impactful outcome of fabricating devices at molecular scales, since no electronic product today incorporates proteins, DNA, or any other biomolecule in a functional way.  Even if molecular devices never compete with traditional digital electronics as memory or transistor devices, these alternate purposes represent untapped new fields with tremendous potential import.\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine a silicon chip device that could report the function of a particular enzyme, or medicine, or catalyst particle.  Directly reporting chemical activity with a solid state device could give users new insights into chemistry happening in real time.  This new information would enable the efficient development of new drugs, or the in situ testing of catalysts to check their effectiveness.  \r\n\r\nThis project aims to experimentally demonstrate and test this premise, and furthermore to monitor chemical activity with molecule-by-molecule precision.  The work is made possible by a recently developed architecture in which single molecules are integrated into functioning carbon nanotube transistor devices.  The nanotube conductance records chemical events in real time with microsecond resolution, as the attached molecule interacts with its immediate environment.  Past work has successfully recorded complex, time varying signals associated single molecule chemistry.  However, the generality of the devices remains unproven, and there is no understanding of how chemical, electronic, and mechanical degrees of freedom combine to generate the signals of interest. A primary goal of this project will be to develop an understanding these possible contributions, in order to develop design rules for how to refine and control the mechanisms at work.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This proposal makes effective use of recent discoveries to push forward the field of molecular electronics, and it does so in a direction of immediate practicality.  The goals are designed to improve our fundamental understanding of signal transduction in single molecule devices, a critical step before such devices can be commercialized for practical applications.  The project is timely and well-positioned because it leverages other ongoing research efforts, it is immediately technically feasible, and suggestive preliminary data exist.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  If successful, this project may help develop an electronic device having wide-ranging commercial significance.  As a high sensitivity and high bandwidth sensor it could benefit a wide spectrum of the medical and pharmaceutical industries through new diagnostic and research capabilities, independent of fluorophores or other optical equipment.  There are also potential benefits to chemical processing generally, through improved process monitoring and control.  The project will also directly support the research training of junior scientists, and the training of science majors interested in becoming K-12 science teachers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs sensors shrink smaller and smaller, they approach a scale where single molecule sensing becomes possible.  At this scale, new fundamental science becomes possible.  How exactly does a molecule interact with an electronic circuit?  Is the interaction general, or unique to particular types of molecules?   This project was designed to understand how a molecule\u00c6s chemical, electronic, and mechanical degrees of freedom combine to generate an electronic signal in practical sensors.  Specifically, the project used single-walled carbon nanotube transistors as exquisitely sensitive sensors.  When a single molecule was covalently attached to one of these transistors, the device could monitor the molecule\u00c6s motions and chemical activity.\n\nWhile the possibility of sensing chemical activity with molecule-by-molecule resolution has many exciting applications, the current understanding of this transduction is highly speculative.  The goal of this research program was to acquire experimental data from a range of single molecule devices so that a more complete model of this single-molecule transduction could be developed.  The project aimed to understand the limits of time resolution, the sensitivity of transduction to the surrounding environment, and the relative importance of the transduction mechanisms that might be involved.  The project organized this fundamental research into two main thrusts.  The first thrust compared different types of molecules to probe the function of the electronic device.  The second thrust applied electronic signals to devices in an effort to induce molecular events.  The two thrusts represented the two main aspects &ndash; sensing and actuation &ndash; of transduction and therefore were highly complementary. \n\nThe project accomplished the major activities of fabricating nanotube transistors, functionalizing them with single molecules, and then characterizing both sensing and actuation.  The work led to two U.S. patent applications and six peer-reviewed papers in the scientific literature.  This project has provided us with a much better understanding of electronics at the molecular scale, especially devices in which the molecule of interest is a protein having many degrees of freedom to interact with its environment.  The research into these protein nanocircuits may even lead to new technologies that could lead to a healthier population through effective and inexpensive diagnosis and health care, for example by testing for disease markers or discovering new medicines.\n\nIn addition to the scientific results, a main component of the project was the training of students to become junior research scientists.  Training and education in nanoscience were integral components of the entire project.  Students worked together in a collaborative, team environment learning how to operate complex equipment, acquire and analyze data, and generally perform nanoscience research.  One undergraduate wrote a senior thesis on his work, and two graduate students supported by this grant completed their Ph.D. dissertations in 2015.  Graduate students in particular gained a broad base of experiences that extended beyond one particular discipline or specialization.\n\nIn addition to the researchers, this project also had an outreach component focused on the CalTeach teaching credential program at UC Irvine.  Funding from this grant has helped support 18 undergraduates majoring in physics, chemistry, or math to become K-12 teachers.  All 18 awardees have graduated with California teaching credentials and have entered the K-12 teaching workforce.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip G Collins"
