 "awd_abstract_narration": "Johnson State College in rural Vermont is developing its programs in Environmental and Health Science with scholarships for academically talented but financially needy students, many of whom are the first generation in their families to attend college.  These programs work in partnerships with New England TRIO Upward Bound Math-Science projects in Vermont and have developed articulation agreements with community colleges, high schools, and other institutions of higher learning, so that students can have the maximum opportunity for retention in their majors and academic success.  As a small school, Johnson State can offer individualized mentoring, opportunities for undergraduate research, and advising about graduate school and future careers in environmental science.  This grant is co-funded through the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.",
