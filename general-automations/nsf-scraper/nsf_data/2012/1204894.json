  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the past several decades, two natural random surface models have emerged within physics and mathematics.  The first is Liouville quantum gravity (LQG), which is a continuum model introduced by Polyakov in the 1980s in the context of string theory and later extensively studied in the context of conformal field theory in the 1980s and 1990s.  The second is a random planar map (RPM), which has its roots in the combinatorics literature from the 1960s starting with work of Tutte and Mullin.  It had long been believed that LQG and RPM describe equivalent objects, going back to work of Knizhnik, Polyakov, and Zamolodchikov from the 1980s which showed that exponents for critical models on LQG transform to the corresponding exponents for critical models in the plane in the same way as for RPM.  This connection has remained elusive for many years because the definitions of LQG and RPM are on the surface very different and is further complicated since the original construction of LQG due to Polyakov was non-rigorous.\n\nThe main outcome of the project were several works which developed the continuum theory of LQG which has allowed for the first rigorous correspondences between LQG and RPM to be proved.\n\nThe first work in this direction (joint with Duplantier and Sheffield) shows that LQG surfaces can be represented as a \"mating of trees\", which is a continuum analog of the type of bijective encoding that many RPM models admit.  This has made it possible to show that RPM decorated with a statistical physics model, such as percolation or a uniform spanning tree, converge to LQG in a sense which encodes quantities such as the lengths of interfaces or areas of regions surrounded by the loops of the underlying statistical physics model.\n\nAnother series of works (joint with Sheffield) in this vein shows that it is possible to equip LQG with a metric space structure and identifies it with another continuum random surface called the Brownian map.  It is the uniform measure on surfaces which are homeomorphic to the unit sphere in a similar sense that Brownian motion is the uniform measure on continuous paths.  The Brownian map was previously realized as an abstract metric measure space arising as the scaling limit of RPM in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology in works of Le Gall and Miermont, hence did not come with an embedding into the plane.  The correspondence with LQG equips the Brownian map with such an embedding.  The proof proceeds by developing a new theory of growth models on random surfaces called ``quantum Loewner evolution?? which represent first passage percolation, diffusion limited aggregation, and more generally the dielectric breakdown model on a random surface.\n\nUnderlying the aforementioned works is the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE), a random fractal curve introduced by Schramm in 1999 to describe the scaling limits of critical models in the plane.  SLEs arise in LQG because they represent the interfaces formed by welding together LQG surfaces along their boundaries.  Part of the project therefore involved studying many of the fine properties of SLEs, especially through their connection with the Gaussian free field, which is a fundamental building block in two-dimensional random geometry.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/26/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason P Miller"
