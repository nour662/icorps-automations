 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in ongoing research projects in experimental physics as structured in a summer REU program at the University of Arizona. Students may choose from a wide variety of forefront physics activities, under the direction of senior faculty members from the Department of Physics at the University of Arizona, or also from in research groups located in several other university academic units including Astronomy, Chemistry, Optical Sciences, Lunar and Planetary Studies, and Atmospheric Sciences. The primary source of participants is students who have completed the equivalent of the first or second year curriculum in science or engineering at Pima Community College, in preparation for transfer to a 4-year degree program (although all undergraduate students are eligible to apply). Graduate Teaching Assistants from the physics department serve as mentors for the participants. Special orientation and skills activities are individually tailored to enable the students to make significant contributions to the research projects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur major goal is to provide a research home for local community college students transferring into physics and other STEM majors at University of Arizona.  Many of these students are underrepresented minorities or come from financially struggling families without a history of tertiary education.  Our Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program provides these students with basic research and life skills and places them in a mentored, active research lab for 8 weeks.  Our intent is to give at-risk transfer students deep roots in university life and in scientific research, allowing them to see STEM-related teaching, research and industrial positions as viable career options.\n\nIn the 2012-14 funding cycle, we placed 37 students from Pima Community College in a variety of science and engineering research labs.  Each student was carefully matched with their expressed research interest, informed by lab tours and presentations by participating researchers.  All students were intensively trained in a two-week \"research camp\", where they learned basic skills such as machine shop, digital electronics, computer interfacing, optical microscopy etc., prior to starting research.\n\nStudent and mentor responses to their experiences have been overwhelmingly positive, with many students writing hundreds of words attesting to the difference this program has made in their lives.  Several of these students continued to do extended research projects well past the REU period (for pay or credit).  This program produced several peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations from students who started in the REU program.\n\nOver its 22-year lifetime, our program has sponsored 237 REU participants, 78% of whom have completed at least a BS in natural sciences or engineering.  This compares very favorably to the national average of 44%, and our completion rate is actually higher among women (81%) and underrepresented minorities (85%).\n\nThese numbers translate to a real impact on the lives of students, families and communities.  Since many of the students come from families with limited background in tertiary education, a student's success is anticipated to have a ripple effect through their siblings, extended family and community.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/03/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Srinivas Manne"
