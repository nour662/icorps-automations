 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical description.\r\n\r\nThe transition from abiotic to biotic O2 production in the Precambrian remains one of the abiding mysteries of Earth Science.  Two of the three O2-producing Mn-enzymatic reactions involve mineral-like structures --- these include disproportionation of H2O2 by Mn-catalase (a dimer-like structure) and oxidation of water by a four-Mn-Ca-oxide cluster (the water-oxidation-center, or WOC) in Photosystem II.  The WOC has long been compared to minerals that contain Mn-oxide cubane-like moieties, leading to chemist's models for these reactions, including such things as a MnIV,IV,IV,III -cubane oxide that resembles not only the CaMn4-oxide core of Photosystem-II but also the core of a birnessite-like MnO2 sheet.  We discovered that these molecules actually do convert to a birnessite-like structure under load in the photocatalytic cell---nanosheets of MnO2 form and it is these mineral-like sheets, not the delicate molecules, that perform the catalysis of water oxidation to O2.  The reaction is furthermore broadly similar to the biogeochemical cycling of manganese in the oceans---initial oxidation of aqueous Mn(II) leads to a Mn(III)/Mn(IV) solid oxide, which absorbs visible photons, photoexcites a O(2p)=>Mn(3d) ligand-to-metal-charge transfer and  disproportionate to release Mn2+(aq) and reactive oxygen species.  In this research project, we detail the pathways for the O2 production in these mineral-like MnO2 sheets.\r\n\r\nBroader significance and importance.\r\n\r\n\t1) This project has strong implications for helping humans to find truly sustainable energy resources.  Human society needs to find a cheap, Earth-abundant catalyst that can help trap energy from visible light.  Earth-abundant materials, such as manganese oxides, are essential because the catalysts must work for 10 billion humans---catalysts made from rare elements are impossibly expensive.  Using minerals to trap light energy can also be advantageous, as they can last longer than more delicate catalysts.\r\n\r\n\t2) This project also has implications for understanding the origins of photosynthesis, and the relationship between the mineral components and biological systems of this planet.  We want to understand how a manganese-oxide mineral that was literally as common as dirt became the central enzyme for photosynthesis.  How did the transition occur between the soil mineral and the enzyme?  What energy source drove the reaction before there was O2 in the atmosphere?  \r\n\r\n3) This work will help to strengthen a US-Australia scientific collaboration, as well as the international training of a US student.  The NSF Office of International Science and Engineering is supporting the travel of the student to the collaborating laboratory at Monash University in Australia.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere is intense effort underway to identify forms of energy that do not produce CO2.  Solar energy is perhaps the most appealing target since the sun irradiates our planet with about 10,000 times more energy than humans could use. \n\nHumans can make solar cells that trap light energy at varying efficiencies but the key catalysts are either made out of rare and expensive metals, or the catalysts degrade after repeated redox cycling in water.\n\nMother Nature has already shown scientists what earth-abundant materials can stand repeated redox cycling in water.  These are the soil minerals that we experience every day, including manganese- and iron-oxide minerals.  These materials also catalyse the oxidation of water to O2 via a cycle that plays out every day in the ocean---minerals like MnO2 collect light in the photic zone of the ocean and the metals are photo-reduced from Mn(IV) to Mn(II), causing the mineral to dissolve.  The metals are then microbially oxidized in a separate cycle back to the solid MnO2. \n\nThe oxidation of water to O2 is important to the Earth's energy future because the other product, H2, is useful as an energy-storage material but the accompanying reaction to turn water in to O2 gas requires four electrons and slows the overall efficiency of the process.\n\nIn this project we investigated two things: (i) the use of MnO2 as an electrocatalyst and its efficiency; and (ii) the re-oxidation step of reducing O2 to make MnO2 in the return cycle.  The work was the essence of the PhD thesis of Ms. Lizhi Tao, who coupled electrochemistry to enzyme studies.  She shed light on the action of the key enzyme for making MnO2 and showed that it functions similarly to a class of enzymes called 'multi-copper-oxidases'.\n\nKey to success in this study were collaborators at the University of Monash in Australia, who are experts in the adaptation of MnO2 to make thin-film solar cells.  Also key were collaborators at the California EPR Center at UC Davis, who helped conducted high-resolution spectra of the enzyme in action.  Finally, this work would have been impossible without the guidances of laborators at the Oregon Heath Science University in Portland who showed Dr. Tao how to isolate the enzyme for study.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William H Casey"
