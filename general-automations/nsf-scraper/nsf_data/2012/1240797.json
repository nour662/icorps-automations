The goal of the workshops will be to understand the spectrum of engineering education research and allow emerging areas to gain recognition.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be to help understand the diversity of research investments in engineering education, identify areas that are emerging, and help current researchers better frame their projects using a common ontology.  The project will also help ongoing efforts to evaluate STEM education portfolios.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by making investments that lead to emerging new fields of engineering, or shifting existing fields.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.",
