R/V Pelican as a designated UNOLS vessel adheres to all UNOLS safety standards, NSF inspections, and reporting requirements.  Historically LUMCON has run an efficient and economical operation to support sea-going activities primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.  This award represents the start of a new five-year cooperative agreement, and for each year of the cooperative agreement annual funding will be re-negotiated based upon the number of days at sea in direct support of NSF peer-reviewed research.  This award is for platform support for NSF programs.",
