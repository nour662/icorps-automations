Understanding the nano- and microstructural properties of biomaterials is therefore potentially of very high interest to applied material physics and is key for the fabrication of novel materials with improved properties.  The goal of this symposium is to present, through a series of invited lectures from world leading experts in the field, an overview of the state-of-the art in the microstructural characterization of biological hierarchic materials and the potential for future research in the field.  An excellent team of presenters has been assembled.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  The symposium also provides an attractive educational opportunity for participating students through a satellite tutorial on microstructural characterization techniques of biological materials, as well as ample opportunities for multidisciplinary interactions between veteran researchers and young investigators in the framework on the MRS meeting.",
