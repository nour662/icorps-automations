 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports a workshop to be held in Arlington, VA in January 2012 on Sustainable Chemistry. The workshop aims to identify key areas where fundamental research in the core disciplines (Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering) is needed to advance the goal of increasing the sustainability of chemical processing and manufacturing. This is expected to include strategies to reduce or eliminate the use of rare elements and other scarce materials, reduce the use of freshwater and energy, and increase the feasibility of recovery/recycling.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will explore multidisciplinary approaches and articulate the need for a systems-level view of sustainability, including science, technology, economics and societal impact. This is likely to require new educational approaches to train the next generation of researchers to incorporate such thinking into their research design. The added value created by funding research efforts that incorporate investigators with different perspectives and from different disciplines will be apparent. The broad recommendations to the scientific community as well as specific examples will be incorporated into a widely available report.",
