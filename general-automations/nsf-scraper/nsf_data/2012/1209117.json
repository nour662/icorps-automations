 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first part of this work concerns the estimation of Taylor coefficients of generating functions with a pole or other singularity along a complex algebraic variety.  The relation between the zeros of the polynomial Q and the coefficients of P/Q have been demonstrated in a series of works from 2000 to 2011.  Via Cauchy's integral representation, estimating coefficients is reduced to residue integration along the zero set of Q.  There are two main open problems addressed in this proposal.  In the case where the zero set of Q is smooth, we consider the effective computation of the homology class of the chain of integration with respect to a basis of saddle point contours.  In the case where the zero set of Q is singular, only quadratic singularities have as yet been worked out; we consider here two examples of higher degree. The second part of the proposal concerns the relation between the zeros of Q and the coefficients of Q itself.  This work is part of the emerging field of stable function theory.  The main goal here is to extend the Borcea-Branden-Liggett theory of strong Rayleigh distributions to random variables taking more than two values.  A third part of this proposal concerns problems in discrete probability theory, including locating the critical points of a random polynomial or power series, and a problem on totally anisotropic percolation.\r\n\r\nThe broad impact of this research lies in computational infrastructure for computation in combinatorial applications.  Generating functions are used in many areas of pure and applied mathematics: random graph theory, theory of algorithms, statistical physics, discrete probability theory, population biology and genetics to name a few.  Estimating the coefficients of a generating function is a crucial step in any application of generating function techniques. This work, and particularly the part dealing with automated computation, allows users to compute without having to develop ad hoc methods in each case.  Broad impacts of the second and third parts of the proposal include further understanding of negative dependence among random variables.  There are also educational outcomes from work on curriculum development and K-12 education enabled by this grant.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project addressed several areas of mathematics and one area of mathematics education.\n\n(1) Analytic Combinatorics.  \n\n\n\n\nCombinatorial analysis, via generating functions, is used heavily in many areas, including statistical mechanics, discrete probability modeling, genomics, graph theory and network modeling, and many others. When using generating functions, it is critical to be able to extract asymptotic information.  Previous to this project, the extraction of asymptotics in more than one variable was possible only in narrow cases when the objects being counted follow a normal distribution.  New results from this project extend to many other regimes, with shapes that look far from normal (see Figure 1 \"non-gaussian limit law\").\n\nIn addition, the PI along with long-time collaborator Mark Wilson have published a textbook on the techniques involved in multivariate asymptotics.  This book highlights many techniques from analysis which are applied for the first time to combinatorial enumeration.\n\n\n(2) Discrete probability models.\n\nMuch work in probability theory is driven by the desire to model various physical or social processes.  Often the complexity of these systems is sufficiently great that a stochastic model is the only one that is plausible or tractable.  A number of the results in this report are of this nature.  For example, we examine a model for coarsening (crystal formation in one dimension) and show that the Poisson point process (essentially, the most random possible configuration of points) will be the result of running a deterministic coarsening process for a long time, starting from a random initial condition.\n\n(3) Forecast aggregation.  \n\nThe rise of futures markets for crowdsourcing predictions of events has led to an explosion in the science of event forecasting.  One central problem is how to combine probability forecasts from more than one forecaster so as to produce a forecast that is better than either component forecast.  We give a theoretical underpinning for this problem, the \"partial information framework\" and apply it to several basic cases.  By doing so, we explain various non-theoretically based practices such as extremization, while also producing new aggregators that, in some cases, outperform the old ones.  \n\n(4) Math education.\n\nFreshman calculus is often taught based on a curriculum developed for STEM fields, sometimes slightly adapted to non-technical disciplines.  A broad outcome of this project has been the development of a calculus course for business students that delivers a basket of usable skills.  An active learning approach is used to guarantee students are engaging in problem solving and working on verbal skills, these being two crucial areas ignored by curricula designed to deliver skills rapidly to STEM students already in possession of fundamentals.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robin A Pemantle"
