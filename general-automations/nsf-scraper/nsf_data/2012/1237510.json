The students will be selected by a committee of leading experts in the field.  These funds will simultaneously aide these students and post-docs to optionally attend the XXIX International Colloquium on Group-Theoretical Methods in Physics (GROUP29), which will have a loop quantum gravity session, and which will be held from August 20th to August 26th at the Chern Institute of Mathematics, Nankai University, not far from Beijing. \r\n\r\nThe broad impact of this proposal will be in the preparation of human resources.  Most of the courses taught at the BNU school are not taught at U.S. universities.  Attendance at this type of conference is a formative event in the preparation of the new generation of U.S. researchers in the field.",
