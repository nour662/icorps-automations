 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches:\r\nThe objective of this research is to advance organic solar cells using tailored chemistries of metallic nanoparticles that when assembled into a thin film act like tiny lenses across the film surface to focus sunlight onto the light absorption region. When metal nanoparticles are aligned into a perfect periodic checker-board array, they can create a plasmonic resonance leading to a high augmented absorption. There will be a significant leveraging through an alliance with the local company, MetaMateria. Also, collaborations with Prof. Terry Bigioni will further expand the scope of study. Metamateria will fashion nanoparticles to be placed adjacent the active collection region and Bigioni will create nanoparticles to be placed inside the active region. The addition of Prof. James Coe from Ohio State's Chemistry provides an experienced background with modeling plasmonic optical effects. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe proposed project will establish a world-class program in polymer solar cells that will advance low-cost polymer solar cells using plasmonics. The development of unique and tailored nanoparticles chemistries with MetaMateria will be a platform technology for other applications, such as fuel cells and water purification, which are key commercialization thrusts for Metamateria\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThrough collaborations with industry, we will increase the competitiveness and position of US industry and advance the efficiency and functionality of solar cells. Participation of industry will broaden the culture of innovation and focus the research output towards strategic commercialization. Undergraduate researchers will provide valuable and substantive contributions to the proposed work.",

Intrinsic properties of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have suggested them not only as a promising alternative but also as a tantalizing complement to conventional inorganic photovoltaics. For the last three decades, OPV research has mainly focused on achieving higher efficiencies. Through sophisticated device geometry, tailored development of new polymers benefited from their synthetic flexibility, and heuristic morphology control aided by various nanoscale microscopy technologies, NREL-certified efficiencies of OPVs reached 10.6 and 11.5 percent in tandem and single cells, respectively. Even though remarkable improvement has been made in three decades, current efficiency of PSCs is not comparable to that of inorganic counterparts, e.g. ~ 44 percent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project, OSU and MetaMateria explored plasmonic metal nanoparticles to improve efficiencies of OPVs. Essentially plasmonics acts to focus and intensify the light onto the photoactive region by its near-field lensing properties at resonance. MetaMateria synthesized colloids of silver nanoparticles (~ 4 nm) that showed sharp and intense plasmonic peak around 410 nm. OSU performed three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D FDTD) simulations using the specifications of the silver nanoparticles and the resulting extinction spectra resemble the experimental data. Furthermore, the effect of particle size, lattice spacing, and lack of monodispersity of the hexagonal array of silver nanoparticles on the extinction resonance was also investigated to help determine optimal design specifications for efficient OPV power harvesting. By leveraging this project, we collaborated with Uzbekistan Academy of Science to explore antireflection coatings (ARCs) in OPVs in an attempt to broaden the scope of this project in terms of light management. Flouride-based ARC improved the transmittance by 3 %.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, the project provided substantive international collaboration opportunities with foreign partners, including Finland and Uzbekistan. Moreover, the project provided educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, including minority students, from diverse science and engineering majors.
