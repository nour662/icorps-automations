 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project proposes to\r\nformulate and engineer chemically modified bio-based and biodegradable Poly(Lactide) based\r\ncompounds, to generate a new class of materials that are, high strength, lightweight,\r\nmultifunctional, environmentally friendly & cost-effective as an alternative to petroleum based\r\npolymers. NTIC has successfully commercialized a portfolio of reactive blended bio-based\r\nand/or biodegradable resins for extrusion, molding, and coating applications. However, it faces a\r\nmajor hurdle due to poor mechanical properties, high prices, and higher densities of current PLA\r\nmaterials. NTIC successfully developed novel chemistries of compatibilization to create\r\nadvanced PLA bio-resins that offer improved toughness in Phase I of this work. The newly\r\nsynthesized materials were applied in four different processing platforms to provide extruded\r\nfilms, injection molded cutlery, extrusion coated paper, and extrusion blow molded bottles.\r\nPhase II funding will allow NTIC to build on the success of the initial trials and build an\r\nimproved, broader portfolio of high strength and economically viable PLA based products.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are technical, environmental, and\r\neconomical. This work will (1) widen the window of performance of PLA based applications; (2)\r\nfurther fundamental understanding of PLA and its chemistries (3) greatly increase the use of\r\nbiobased products in larger industrial and packaging markets implying environmental\r\npreservation of fossil fuel resources; and (4) create new jobs for sales, manufacturing, technical\r\nsupport of newly developed Natur-Tec\u00ae products.",
