 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Promote-Retain-Invest in Science and Mathematics (PRISM) Women Scholars Program is designed to: \r\n(a) Attract current and future students to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. \r\n(b) Improve educational opportunities for undergraduate women pursuing STEM majors. \r\n(c) Increase retention of STEM majors to degree achievement. \r\n(d) Improve student support programs for women pursuing STEM careers. \r\n\r\nThe program is aimed at encouraging high academic achievement, promoting research and internship opportunities, encouraging outreach and community service, and preparing recipients for careers and/or continued studies in STEM-related fields. The program also encourages recipients to network with their peers, provide and receive peer mentoring support, and engage in high quality group learning activities. The ultimate goal is to develop well-rounded and highly-skilled STEM graduates who are prepared to meet the national need for more American scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The program benefits women who are pursuing majors in biology, chemistry, computational mathematics, mathematics, and statistics and actuarial mathematics, and/or completing the requirements for the dual degree program in engineering in conjunction with the University of Notre Dame. The college is using S-STEM grant funds to provide ten scholarships in each of two cohorts for students entering their sophomore year. Scholarship recipients continue to receive support from the program through the remainder of their undergraduate career, provided they maintain academic and social good standing and make acceptable progress toward the completion of their degree. For the 20 recipients, the scholarships provide financial support, as well as opportunities to gain valuable research experience, and to interact with mentors and other professionals in their field. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The program emphasizes the priorities of integrating teaching and research, promoting diversity, and encouraging scientific understanding that benefits society. It helps produce students well prepared to succeed in fields where women have traditionally been underrepresented by helping to develop individuals capable of meeting the national need for more American scientists and engineers.",
