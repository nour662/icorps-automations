 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Ocean, dominated by the huge Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC),  is responding markedly to climate change, being driven by circumpolar winds that have increased over the past  ~30 years, and warming significantly more that the global ocean over the past ~50 years.  Geographically, the Drake passage provides a natural ?chokepoint?  for measuring the time varying transport of the ACC component flows. In turn this provides us with a means of taking the ?pulse? of the Southern Ocean circulation.  \r\n\r\nThe cDrake field experiment is an IPY project to resolve seasonal to interannual variability of the ACC over a four year period. Using an array of (~40) bottom-moored Current and Pressure-recording Inverted Echo Sounders (CPIES) which measure bottom pressure along with the travel time  of 12kHZ sound pulses to and from the surface, a time series of velocity and temperature profiles over a grid array has been assembled over a 5 year timespan. \r\n\r\nA full analysis of the CPIE and ancillary hydrographic data sets (e.g. CTD, ADCP and XBT) will be undertaken to resolve the ACC transport variability, partition its vertical structure between barotropic and baroclinic components, and its lateral structure partitioned between the many jets and fronts  that comprise the ACC in the Drake Passage.",

The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is the pulse of the Southern Ocean, and the Drake Passage chokepoint is well suited geographically for measuring its transport and assessing dynamics that control the currents.  cDrake was a field experiment designed to measure ACC transport and dynamics over a four year period using bottom-moored Current and Pressure-recording Inverted Echo Sounders (CPIES).

The total transport of water volume by the ACC is the sum of the transport due to the nearly uniform top-to-bottom currents and the transport due to density-driven currents.  Previous observations, such as repeat hydrographic transects across the current provided a good estimate of the transport associated with density-driven currents and therefore captured only part of the total transport.  The cDrake instrumentation was capable of measuring accurately for the first time both contributions to the total transport, the density-driven part and the part contributed by uniform top-to-bottom currents.  A commonly used estimate of the density-driven part was confirmed with greater accuracy by the cDrake mean estimate of 127.7 Sv  &plusmn;5.9 Sv (where 1 Sv is 1 million cubic meters per second). The new total combined cDrake-estimated mean eastward transport of 173.3 Sv  &plusmn;10.7 Sv is a consequential advance because both components contributing to transport are well resolved, and cDrake sampling ensured an unaliased and stable estimate of the transport.

This 30% increase is ascribed to improvements in the measurement system rather than due to the ocean?s response to increasing strength of Southern Ocean winds over the past few decades.\n\nWithin the ACC, poleward eddy heat fluxes play an important role in the global energy balance, yet only a handful of direct estimates of Southern Ocean eddy heat fluxes exist.  cDrake documented that eddy heat fluxes were poleward almost everywhere in Drake Passage and were generated by the rapid growth of ocean meanders.  Spatially, eddy heat fluxes were largest in the lee of the Shackleton Fracture Zone, a topographic ridge that spans Drake Passage.   A power-law between eddy heat flux and sea surface height standard deviation was indicated by the cDrake direct observations and further verified with the Southern Ocean State Estimate. This relationship was applied to satellite sea surface height standard deviation to determine global estimates of eddy heat fluxes.   Enhanced eddy heat fluxes occurred in a handful of hot spots that are associated with major topographic ridges as well as regions where the ACC interacts with subtropical western boundary currents.  Within these hot spots, cross-front exchange usually does not span the full latitudinal width of the ACC, implying a hand-off of heat between ACC fronts and frontal zones as they encounter the different eddy heat flux hot spots along their circumpolar path.  Trends of increasing downgradient eddy heat fluxes between 1993 and 2014 occurred at three of the eight eddy heat flux hot spots.\n\nThe cDrake local dynamics array data allowed a thorough analysis of dynamical balances within the ACC in its mean flow and in its large meanders and eddies.  Important dynamical effects were shown to arise due to the time-varying curving path of the current and due to turning of the current direction at increasing depths, associated vertical motion and internal stretching of the water column.  These processes convey torque from winds at the sea surface down through the water column to the seafloor.  It was shown that the average bottom torques under the cDrake portion of Drake Passage were particularly concentrated along the South American continental slope;  in overall average these bottom torques were sufficient to balance the surface wind inputs along a segment of the ACC 15-20 times as long.   \n\ncDrake measured bottom temperature at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.  Observations documented that bottom temperature variability spans a wide range of time scales. Moreover, due to strong interannual variability, long time series are necessary to resolve temporal trends.\n\nThis project increased the participation, training and professional development of women at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels in an area of science, engineering and technology where they are underrepresented. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kathleen A Donohue"
