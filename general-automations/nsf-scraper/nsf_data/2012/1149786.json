 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the massive proliferation of mobile devices like smart phones and tablets, mobile cloud computing (MCC) has emerged as a new paradigm and extension of cloud computing, with which users can access a plethora of unique features. Unfortunately, since mobile users offload most computation and storage to the cloud and are usually battery-powered, high performance connections to the cloud tend to become the bottleneck, hindering the efficiency of MCC. Thus, throughput and energy efficiency for the connections to the cloud are two critical and challenging design issues in MCC, which should be addressed carefully. In this project, the PI proposes a novel Multi-radio Multi-channel Multi-hop Cellular Network architecture to facilitate MCC, and investigates throughput and energy optimization by focusing on the following three main research thrusts: (1) throughput optimization for communications between cloud users and base stations (U2B) in hybrid mode, (2) path capacity optimization for communications among cloud users (U2U) with cooperation, and (3) energy optimization for U2B/U2U communications. The results of this project will advance the state of the art in network optimization for MCC and enrich the scientific knowledge of network design. The proposed research is thus crucial to the success of MCC, which can provide great opportunities for job creation, greater productivity, and economic growth. The results of the project will be disseminated through publications and talks. The proposed research will also be integrated with curriculum development, minority student recruitment, training and mentoring, and outreach to K-12 students.",
