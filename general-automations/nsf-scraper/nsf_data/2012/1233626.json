 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research on a novel fabrication methodology for creating smart polymer surfaces and nanostructures that are capable of changing shapes at nanoscale.  The proposed methodology combines the nanofabrication capability of nanoimprint lithography (NIL) with the stimuli-responsive 'shape memory' effect of network polymers.  An experimental platform will be developed to precisely determine the geometry and the energy associated with the nanoscale shape change, which, in turn, will enable systematic examinations of how the NIL parameters such as temperature, pressure and processing time influence the nanoscale shape memory effect.  A range of bulk shape memory polymers with systematically-varying chemical and physical properties will be studied for their applicability as the proposed new class of smart surfaces and nanostructures.  In addition, unique applications enabled by this new fabrication methodology in areas of optics and biomaterials will be explored.\r\n  \r\nIf successful, the results of the research will advance our current understanding of nanoscale shape memory effect of polymers, and shed light on the entropic (or rubber) elasticity of polymers at length scale approaching the network structures.  The research will also provide a new methodology for fabricating smart polymer surfaces and nanostructures at low cost and without the need for complex chemistry, and establish the structure-processing-property relationships needed for using this methodology for scalable manufacturing.  This research will also enhance the professional development of graduate students, promote diversity in science and engineering disciplines, and enrich K-12 outreach, with a focus on emerging polymer-based nanofabrication technologies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to develop a new and scalable nanomanfacturing method that can create stimuli-responsive polymer surfaces, i.e. surfaces that can alter their properties such as color, friction resistance, wettability, and adhesion.  The approach we developed under this project was based on a combination of nanoimprint lithography (NIL) and shape memory effect (SME) that is the ability of crosslinked polymers to memorize and recover their permanent shapes when exposed to heat and solvent.   Tremendous efforts have been spent on controlling and utilizing the SME of polymers for biomedical, aerospace, and structural applications.  A typical SME cycle consists of: (1) a \"programing\" step, where a shape memory polymer (SMP) is mechanically transformed into a temporary shape at a temperature above its glass transition temperature (Tg); (2) a \"fixing\" step where the temporary shape of the SMP is fixed when the SMP is cooled below its Tg; and (3) a \"recovery\" step, where the SMP recovers its permanent shape upon heating or exposure to a favorable solvent.  The fundamental mechanism of the SME is the entropic elasticity of crosslinked polymers.  At permanent shape, the polymer chains in the network are at the lowest conformational energy states.  During the thermomechanical \"programming\", the chains are deformed and frozen into higher energy states, which will recover to the lowest energy states once the polymer is softened by heating or solvent exposure.  For most of these applications, the active volume involved in the SME cycle is at macroscopic scale.  Under this project, we developed a new method of using NIL to harness the SME at the SMP surfaces with tiny active volume.  In our case, permanent surface patterns are first replicated onto a SMP surface by curing the polymer under a patterned mold (made of elastomers or rigid materials with the surface features designed for certain applications).  The permanent surface pattern of the SMP is then programmed using NIL into a different type of pattern, e.g. a flat surface or a 2D pattern array.  The temporary pattern on the polymer surface will change to the permanent one when the polymer is exposed to heat or solvent.  Such stimuli-responsive surfaces have several advantages: (1) Since the active volume involved in the entire SME cycle is reduced to sub-micron scale, fast response rate can be achieved.  The slow response rate for macroscopic SMPs is a major limit for their applications.  (2) The innovative use of lithographically designed surface patterns, rather than macroscopic shapes, allow us to achieve controlled optical responses (change of color or diffractive properties), wettability of liquids, adhesion and friction of solids.  (3) The method is broadly applicable to all crosslinked polymers and does not require sophisticated chemistry.\n\nUpon completion of the project, we gained the knowledge on the processing-structure-property relationships for the proposed method, by integrating comprehensive experimental study with thermomechanical modelling.  In terms of materials, we examined several different classes of crosslinked SMPs including, lightly crosslinked polystyrene, (meth)acrylate-based resins, thiol-ene based resins, and even novel polymer networks that contain molecular switches for controlled stress relaxations.  In terms of surface geometry of the SMPs, we examined planar films, surface-patterned films, and even micro- and nanospheres.  These studies collectively show that harvesting SME of crosslinked polymers at reduced dimensions can allow us to harvest many exciting functional properties that have not been achieved prior to this project.  \n\nThe broader impacts of the project lie in several areas: (1) potential economic impact through technological application of such stimuli-responsive polymer surfaces in areas of optical communication, biomedical devices, deicing, and dry adhesives.  (2) training of workforce at levels including Ph.D students, undergraduate and high school students, which is crucial for maintaining the leadership of US in research and technological developments under an increasingly competitive international environment. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yifu Ding"
