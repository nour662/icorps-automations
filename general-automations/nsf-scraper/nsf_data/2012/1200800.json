 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to create an efficient computer method for high-resolution topology optimization of structures in three-dimension (3D) so that fine details in 3D can be topologically optimized. The new approach aims to improve the efficiency and resolution of topological design by decoupling the topology representation from the analysis elements. More specifically, we will create a new method: using efficient higher-order elements for analysis and embedding multiple density variables in each element for high-resolution topology representation. Our research objective is thus to understand how the order of the analysis elements and the distribution of density variables within each element affect the resulting design resolution, the analysis efficiency and optimization stability, and upon which to further develop a formal method that enables efficient and stable high-resolution 3D topology optimization.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this research would result in both theoretical breakthroughs and practical advances in topology optimization. Theoretically, this research would offer a new method for topology optimization: the use of higher-order multi-density elements. It represents a significant shift in topology optimization methods where traditionally only single-density linear elements are used. Practically, this research would lead to an efficient method for high resolution topology optimization of 3D structures, which is prohibitively expensive with existing methods. This research would positively impact a host of industries ranging from automotive, aerospace to manufacturing industry where topology optimization of 3D structures are urgently needed. The resulting method, when applied to multiphysics systems in hybrid-vehicle development, would provide a key enabling technology for the advancement of modern vehicle systems. The method would also enable the utilization of additive manufacturing capability to cost-effectively fabricate previously difficult to-manufacture, topologically optimized geometries for substantial performance improvements in aviation and transportation industry.",
