 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the 10,000 species of living birds and their extinct dinosaurian ancestors, the relative size of, and investment in wings versus legs varies dramatically.  This variation probably has profound effects on locomotor performance and many related aspects of bird ecology, including habitat preferences, foraging strategies, migration patterns, and parental care. In an effort to understand the ecological ramifications of how wings and legs function independently and cooperatively during development and evolution, the investigators will measure wing and leg morphology and locomotor performance in Australian brush turkeys (Alectura lathami) throughout their development. These data will be compared to previous studies we have conducted with two species having different patterns of locomotor development [mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar)], and these comparisons will provide new insight into leg and wing structure and the mechanics of movement in juvenile and adult birds. \r\n\r\nThis project integrates the approaches of several biological disciplines and so the result will be broadly significant.  This project will train undergraduate students in principles of scientific investigation.  In addition, the investigators will disseminate their result to the public by making presentations to several groups (Montana Audobon Society, Upward Bound, the Society of Environmental Journalists, the Montana Girl Scouts) and to popular media outlets (History Channel, National Geographic).",
