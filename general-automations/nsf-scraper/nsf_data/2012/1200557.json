 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research project is focused on understanding the fundamental optical and plasma mechanisms in the laser-assisted tip-based nanomanufacturing (LA-TBN) process, utilizing the understanding to identify the optimal conditions for near-field radiation enhancement and plasma-mediated ablation at the sample surface that allow the use of advanced control techniques to achieve robust, high-speed, high-quality LA-TBN. The near-field radiation enhanced plasma-mediated ablation effect and possibly associated thermal side effects during the LA-TBN process will be clarified and distinguished through simulation and experiments enabled by the use of advanced control techniques. The gained knowledge will then be used to analyze and optimize the nanofabrication conditions towards fabrication robustness and quality. The optimal fabrication conditions will be achieved through the development and implementation of advanced control techniques, which in turn, leads to high-speed and high quality nanofabrication. The technique will be implemented and evaluated through the fabrication of a maze-like complicated pattern in single crystal silicon. \r\n\r\nThe success of this project will not only significantly enhance the advantages of the LA-TBN process over other nanofabrication methodologies, including low-cost, ultra-high-resolution and versatility in materials that can be processed, but willalso increase understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in this intriguing process. As one of the first systematic attempts to overcome critical barriers in the LA-TBN process, this project enables these advantages for the productive implementations of this technique in strategically important areas, such as semiconductors. The educational activities comprise curriculum development, recruitment and retaining of under-represented students, and outreach to K-12.",

Weshowed through experimental results that by using our technique high-quality,highly-uniform patterns can be directly produced on hard metalsubstrate.&nbsp;We also created advanced iterative learning control and signalprocessing algorithms for high-throughput manufacturingapplications. Particularly, we further developed a data-drivenmodeling-free iterative learning to achieve higher tracking precisionand improve the robustness of the algorithms against nonlinearity(such as non-symmetric hysteresis effect) and changes of systemdynamics. We also create a time-optimal algorithm to implement thefast Fourier transform (FFT) on general-purpose microprocessors (suchas Intel x86-based microprocessors). The algorithm minimizes theper-sampling-period computation time of FFT, thereby, greatly enhancesthe online implementation of FFT in applications such as thefrequency-domain iterative learning control algorithms and signalprocessing in areas including advanced manufacturing.&nbsp; The research outcome of this project demonstrated the feasibility ofthe laser-assisted probe-based nanofabrication coupled with advancedcontrol technique in practical uses. The fabrication quality in boththe uniformity of the geometry dimension and the surface smoothness has beengreatly improved over those shown in previous work, which in turn,pushed this technology one leap-step forward towards its practicaluses. Moreover, the high patterning speed in the 1-10 mm/sec range onhard metal surface--as demonstrated in this project--is on par with that of the electronic-beam (E-beam)lithography technology. Thus, the project also demonstrated that thelaser-assisted probe-based nanofabrication can be a very competitivealternate to E-beam lithography at a much lower cost in both equipmentand operation cost.&nbsp;The project has resulted in over 12 journal articles (of which four havebeen published, six are currently under review/revision, and two arecurrently under preparation), and over 10 conference papers. With the support of this project, seven graduate students have been trained, of whom three Ph.D. students and three Master students havebeen graduated, and through the support of the research ofundergraduate experience (RUE) supplementary grant), six undergraduatestudents have also been trained. The research project has also beenpresented to over fifty general visitors including high-school studentsand their parents through open lab tours during Rutger's open house days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/02/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Qingze&nbsp;Zou</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200557/1200557_10195994_1509651091375_Jiangbo_LinePatterns2D-3D--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200557/1200557_10195994_1509651091375_Jiangbo_LinePatterns2D-3D--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Line patterns fabricated at different speeds by using the laser-assisted probe-based nanofabrication technique developed in this project.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200557/1200557_10195994_1509651091375_Jiangbo_LinePatterns2D-3D--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Line patterns fabricated at different speeds by using the laser-assisted probe-based nanofabrication technique developed in this project.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Line patterns fabricated at different speeds by using the laser-assisted probe-based nanofabrication technique developed in this project.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jiangbo Liu, Zhixiong Guo, and Qingze Zou</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Qingze&nbsp;Zou</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Line patterns fabricated at different speeds by using the laser-assisted probe-based nanofabrication technique developed in this project.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200557/1200557_10195994_1506374610512_Zhihua_Plowing_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200557/1200557_10195994_1506374610512_Zhihua_Plowing_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Line patterns directly fabricated on hard metal surface at high-speeds\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200557/1200557_10195994_1506374610512_Zhihua_Plowing_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Line patterns directly fabricated on hard metal surface at high-speeds\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Images of the groove patterns fabricated at different speeds by using the HOMDIIC technique with  ultrasonic vibration applied;(b) the zoomed-inimage in (a);
