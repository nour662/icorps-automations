This in-depth analysis of cell characterizations using fluorescence detection to distinguish 17 or more characteristics simultaneously on individual cells and employing multiple parameters to sort these populations while maintaining the viability of the cells will advance the employment of flow cytometers in biomedical research. The isolation and identification of the cancer progenitor cell is only recently feasible because the technology has evolved such that multiple fluorochromes excited by specific wavelengths emitted from several lasers and unique detectors can sort cells based on multiple markers simultaneously. This requires stable laser lines, careful compensation controls, defined fluidics and sensitive optics and detectors. The hypothesis to be tested is that based on identifiable characteristics, the earliest cancer progenitor cell in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can be identified.",

The investigators in this proposal have been involved in identification of the precursor state of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and  flow cytometric sorting of this population demonstrated that microRNA miR15a/16 is selectively decreased in this population. These cells may be the important leukemia progenitor cells.  We have analyzed congenic mice in which the mutated miR15a/16 region has been introduced into control mouse strains.  The resultant mice have increased levels of B-1 cells and decreased miR15a/16.  This is an important verification of the role of the mutation on microRNA processing. We have shown that stem cells with increased levels of miR15a/16 preferentially give rise to B-2 cells, which do not develop into CLL.  This suggests that decreased miR15a/16 is a fundamental defect for the development of CLL.  We have begun two new collaborations both of which need more time to complete. ..."
