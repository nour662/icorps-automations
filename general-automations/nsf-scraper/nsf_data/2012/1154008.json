 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this application is to seek NSF support for the 2nd inaugural joint Biomedical\r\nEngineering Society (BMES) and the Society for Physical Regulation in Biology and Medicine\r\n(SPRBM) Conference on Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE) (30th SPRBM Annual\r\nScientific Conference) (short: 2nd BMES-SPRBM Conference on CMBE). The first joint conference\r\n(2011) on the specific theme of Molecular Imaging and Mechanotransduction was extremely\r\nsuccessful. This joint CMBE conference (2012) will expand the scope and be focused the theme of\r\nCell Motility, Matrix, Mechanobiology and Regeneration. As a rising science field the cellular and\r\nmolecular bioengineering became possible to culture and engineer cells outside the body, and\r\nprovide intrinsic insights for their role in regeneration. In the mean time, the elucidation of the\r\ncellular and molecular basis of life became one of the great achievements of the twentieth century,\r\nculminating in the complete sequencing of the human genome. Today we stand in the midst of an\r\namazing convergence, which has created a nexus for bioengineers. Both the BMES and the\r\nSPRBM realized that research at this remarkable nexus, Now, the inaugural joint BMES-SPRBM\r\nConference on CBME is the beginning of a new focus of the promising subfield in biomedical\r\nengineering and much needed forum for this exciting field.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The explosions of cellular motility, cellular/molecular functional matrix and the\r\nrole of mechanobiology and regeneration such as extracellular matrix and the manipulations in vitro\r\nand in vivo enables new fundamental regeneration at the cellular and molecular level, as well as\r\nproviding new monitoring modalities in vivo. Therefore, these lead to the exciting theme of the\r\ninaugural BMES-SPRBM joint Conference on CMBE. This application will be first is to provide\r\nsupport to young and junior researchers, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students whose\r\nsubmitted papers have been selected for podium presentation on the basis of scientific merits, and\r\npromote minority and women scientists in the field; and second to foster the emergence and growth\r\nof the exciting sub-filed of CMBE. The abstracts will be published in a Conference Proceeding, and\r\nselected full length papers will be published in a special issue of Cellular and Molecular\r\nBioengineering.\r\n\r\nThe specific aims of this meeting are: (1) delineate the current status of cellular and molecular\r\nmotility, matrix, mechanobiology and regeneration, in which leaders from the CMBE fields will give\r\nan overview of cellular molecular motility, functional matrix concepts and review the current state of\r\nmechanobiology and adaptation, as well as their research in molecular/cellular/tissue/ functions and\r\ntissue/organ regeneration; (2) brainstorm the emerging field of CMBE with a focus on the role of\r\ncellular/molecular mechanics, motility, functional matrix and mechanotransduction with regeneration\r\npotentials, which the outcome will be published in a special issue of CMBE; (3) provide training\r\nworkshop for junior faculty, investigators, and students on grant writing and opportunities; and (4)\r\nenvironment setting. The conference program will include Podium Sessions with invited Keynote\r\nspeakers and other invited speakers. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior\r\ninvestigators will also be encouraged to submit abstracts. These abstracts will be organized into a\r\nposter session with cheese/wine receptions. Nine graduate students/postdoctoral fellows will be\r\nselected by the organizing committee to present short talks and six-eight junior investigators will be\r\nselected for a Young and Rising Star session.\r\n\r\nBroad impacts: The rise of engineering in the twentieth century led to profound change for\r\nhumankind. The advances in biology are equally amazing. It became possible to culture and\r\nengineer cells outside the body, and provide intrinsic insights for their role in regeneration. The role\r\nof mechanical modulation of cell functions has been an intensive focus in modern biology and\r\nbioengineering. The explosions of cellular motility, cellular/molecular functional matrix and the role\r\nof mechanobiology and regeneration enables new fundamental regeneration at the cellular and\r\nmolecular level, as well as providing new monitoring modalities in vivo and in patients.\r\n",
