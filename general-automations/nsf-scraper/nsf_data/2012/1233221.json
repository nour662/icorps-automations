The study is in response to the language in the FY12 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Bill, approved by Congress November 2011, that calls for NSF to support such tracking and submit a report to the Committee by November 2012.\r\n\r\nA committee, with the appropriate expertise, will identify existing and additional measures needed to track to the 2011 report's recommendations; discuss the feasibility of including such measures in existing programs of data collection and link them to existing and improved measures of science learning outcomes; and identify additional research needed to inform a full-scale evaluation of progress toward the report's recommendations.",
