 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research funded by this award seeks an understanding of the role and importance of relationships in allocating resources.\r\n\r\nEconomists have a good understanding of competitive markets.  The anonymous, frictionless nature of these markets makes them relatively easy to analyze and makes them an obvious point of departure for studying resource allocations.  Economists have moved beyond this point of departure to study the effects of various frictions, such as market power, externalities, and asymmetric information, giving rise to well-established results in a variety of areas of microeconomics.  This project takes the study of resource allocation in a complementary direction by relaxing the anonymity assumption and studying the role of relationships in resource allocation.  Relationships arise out of repeated, personalized interactions, allowing incentives to be created by intertemporal links in behavior.  In contrast to the standard finding that market frictions lead to inefficient outcomes, relationships may often have salutary efficiency implications.  \r\n\r\nThe project begins with basic work on repeated games.  This work focuses on characterizing equilibrium behavior rather than payoffs and is especially concerned with cases in which agents are either constrained to use or simply choose to use so-called 'simple' strategies.  In particular, the theory of repeated games has given rise to an intuition that some strategies are more reasonable than others, for a variety of reasons that  often touch on concerns for simplicity.  The project develops a formal and precise model of this idea and studies its implications.  The second part of the project turns from the study of repeated games to examine relationships in more applied market context.  The PI examines several different specific settings, each including a continuing relationship between two decision makers.  These continuing relationships bring both benefits and costs; the goal is to determine when these relationships enhance market efficiency.  The third part of the project examines the evolutionary game theory foundations of information processing and belief formation.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal is a better understanding of how relationships help allocate resources.  The research investigates when relationships complement or even replace prices and markets in allocating resources, when the result is an improvement in the allocation of resources, and how we can design markets and economic institutions to make good use of the power of relationships.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include stronger ties between evolutionary game theory work in three different fields -- economics, biology, and psychology.  The project also provides a framework for graduate student research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn standard economic theory, resources are allocated in markets characterized by a single \"market\" price.  This price induces buyers and sellers to sort themselves into those who will participate in the market and those who will stay out.  The participants then interact anonymously, in the sense that it does not matter who interacts with whom. \n\n \n\nThe research supported by this proposal is motivated by the observation that many resources in our economy are allocated by personalized relationships rather than anonymous interactions.  For example, firms and suppliers may interact repeatedly, so that unexpected events (such as cost overruns, design changes or delivery glitches) give rise not to changes in the current price or appeals to provisions in the current contract, but to an agreement that \"we'll make it up next time.\"  Alternatively, firms and workers in the market for skilled labor are idiosyncratic, with different needs and working conditions on the part of firms and different skills on the part of workers, so that the market must not only determine who participates in the market and who stays out, but also who is matched with whom.  As workers and jobs in the economy become increasing specialized, we can only expect such \"matching markets\" to become more important.  Markets for consumer goods are similarly becoming increasingly idiosyncratic and specialized.\n\n \n\nAllocating resources in a matching market is a more delicate task than is the case in an anonymous market.  Intuitively, prices have more to do in a matching market.  This research studies the nature of the prices required to effectively allocate resources in a matching market, and studies the conditions under which such markets are likely to give rise to an efficient allocation of resources. \n\n \n\nA first direction of the research considers prices in matching markets.  Prices in a matching market can be either personalized - meaning that there is a separate price for each buyer/seller combination - or uniform, meaning that each seller sets a price and takes all buyers who are willing to buy at that price.  For example, some colleges and universities, especially junior colleges, practice uniform pricing, in the sense that they set a tuition rate and enroll anyone willing to participate at that rate.  Other universities, most notably a relatively small number of elite universities, practice personalized pricing, seen most visibly in the sense that they simply reject most of the applicants, refusing to take them at any price.  Uniform pricing is considerably easier and cheaper to administer than is personalized pricing.  Why do we see uniform prices in some markets and personalized prices in other markets?  When do uniform prices suffice to efficiently clear markets?  Our research directs attention to the property rights that set the stage for trading in a market.  These property rights are in turn set by the legal and institutional environment in which the market operates.  A primary finding is that if (and only if) these property rights satisfy an invariance property, then uniform prices will yield efficient outcomes.  We expect this result to have theoretical and practical applications.  In particular, it opens the door to the possibility that we might design the legal environment in which markets operate to make it more likely that prices give rise to efficient resource allocation.\n\n \n\nA second direction of the research examines the impact of asymmetric information in matching markets.  In many markets, it is a reasonable approximation that firms (for example) can easily obtain a precise idea of the characteristics of potential employees, and that employees are well informed as to the characteristics of firms.  We say that these are markets of complete information.  In other cases, firms (or more generally, buyers) may be unable to precisely assess the characteristics and suitability of workers (or more generally, the products offered for sale by sellers) wit..."
