 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support a conference on teaching history and philosophy of science in K-12 science classes.  The history and philosophy of science (HPS) are important topics that play a significant role in scholarship about science: its historical and current development; its methods and innovations in such methods; and its philosophical and theoretical bases. HPS is also included, in some form or other, in many state's science standards and in national standards and reform efforts. Despite this prevalence and relevance, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence on how HPS should be taught to achieve desired learning outcomes. This is particularly true of the relationship of HPS to science achievement, as measurable by most standardized tests, but it is also true of the relationship of HPS to other outcomes, such as inquiry skills, practices of science, or scientific reasoning ability. \r\n\r\nThe present conference will envision a research agenda about the role of HPS in K-12 education. It will include scholars from a variety of fields: HPS; STEM disciplines; science education research; psychology and cognitive sciences; and education research methods. The 2.5-day conference will combine three activities: a one-day symposium with public lectures and panel discussions by US and international scholars on HPS, science education, cognitive science, and education research; a one-day invitational workshop to set an agenda for future research and ideas for proposals for future funded projects; and a meeting of the project steering committee to synthesize points from Days 1-2 and to coordinate writing of a monograph, journal special issue, or similar compilation of reports to the field.",

The first conference, \"How Can the History and Philosophy of Science Contribute to Contemporary U.S. Science Education?\", included more than 70 invited conferees with 12 presentations over two days followed by the formation of working groups for further discussion of topics that emerged during the presentations. A second smaller conference was held three years later with a smaller number of invitees.\n\nThe following themes emerged as outcomes from a review of the presentations of the speakers and reports of the working groups at the first conference.\n\nStudents need to understand that central to science is argumentation, criticism, and analysis. As expressed by the conferees in their presentations and reports, central to the nature of science is argument based on critical reasoning that cites evidence and/or well-supported theory. \nStudents should be educated to appreciate science as part of our culture. Several speakers emphasized the place of science in a liberal arts education; that science education not be separated from the humanities and the social sciences in the name of STEM competitiveness; that we need to recognize science as part of our culture as we do art and music; and, that sociocultural connections with science should be used to motivate students for its study.\nStudents should be science literate. Here the objective of education for science literacy is interpreted as the preparation of students to be prepared to make decisions when science affects them personally, and to be prepared make decisions about science policy as citizens of a participatory democracy. \nWhat is meant by the nature of science as discussed in much of the science education literature must be broadened to accommodate a science literacy that includes preparation for socioscientific issues.\nTeaching for science literacy requires the development of new assessment tools. \nIt is difficult to change what science teachers do in their classrooms. The demands on science teachers are stringent. High stakes testing that stresses content mastery, classroom time constraints, and the wide range of teachers? collateral responsibilities during the work day, all militate against introduction of new materials into the classroom that may appear tangential to science content mastery. These obstacles coupled with the need for new assessment tools makes it difficult to introduce more of the history and philosophy of science in the science classroom necessary to prepare students to be science literate. \n\n\nThe second conference, \"How Can HPS Contribute to Science Literacy and Citizenship?\", invited eight speakers to address specifically the theme of using the history and philosophy science to prepare students to be science literate where such literacy goes beyond science content knowledge and includes preparation to evaluate science policy as citizens and as elected leaders.
