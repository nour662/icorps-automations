 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding renews a highly-successful CISE Research Experiences for\r\nUndergraduates (REU) site at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa.  This\r\nsite focuses on empirical software engineering and its projects span\r\nseveral exciting areas of inquiry, including text retrieval based\r\nfeature location, code clone evolution, software engineering techniques\r\nand tools for computational science & engineering, and open-source\r\ndeveloper communities.\r\n\r\nThis REU site will allow 30 students (over three years) to experience\r\nSoftware Engineering research.  Participating students will attend\r\nresearch training and professional development seminars.  Students will\r\nhave the opportunity to submit their research to quality conferences and\r\nto present their work, if accepted.  The project team is committed to\r\nincluding under-represented minority students in their research.  Thus\r\nthis project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate\r\nstudents and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding\r\nwhile promoting learning.",
