 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet is a global ``network of networks,'' connecting a broad range of edge networks together into a fabric that enriches the lives and businesses of millions of people every day.  Study of the Internet---from routing behavior to traffic characteristics to inferring operator policies to security properties and beyond---has blossomed over the past two decades.  A large literature now exists of studies undertaken by the research community, producing much empirically-based insight into the Internet's operation.  However, the edge networks that the Internet weaves together---from cellular to enterprise to residential to data center networks---have received far less empirical study.  The complexity of these networks grows ever-increasing, yet our understanding has failed to keep pace.\r\n\r\nDespite their widespread use and major roles in facilitating modern economic productivity, networks at this scale have received at best fleeting examination in the research literature.  Part of the issue with studying these types of networks is that general availability of analysis tools is nearly non-existent.  While tools to analyze packet trace data from wide-area networks are plentiful, this is not the case for enterprise networks.  For instance, there are many application layer protocols that manifest inside enterprise networks, but rarely transit the shared Internet, for which no packet trace analysis tools exist.  In this project we will develop such tools in the context of the Bro intrusion detection system.\r\nThese tools will form a capability that enables deep analysis of enterprise networks by the research community at-large.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Enterprise networks are vastly complicated entities that have been significantly understudied by the community.  This project will dramatically broaden and deepen our capability to soundly measure these critical networks.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: By building enterprise network analysis techniques directly into the open-source Bro network monitoring system, we will enable broad access to these new capabilities, aiding both researchers conducting investigations of enterprise networks, and security operators who deploy Bro to protect their networks.  As Bro has hundreds of users, providing this latter group with new analysis capabilities will have a significant real-world impact on network security.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project we increased network operators' abilities to monitor and understand enterprise networks: the large internal networks used by companies and institutions for their daily operations.\n\nOne of the impediments to deep understanding of what transpires in enterprise networks is a lack of support for enterprise-centered protocols in standard monitoring software.  Rather, such monitors prioritize understanding general (\"wide-area\") Internet traffic.  We addressed this deficiency through the development of a range of traffic analyzers for our Bro Network Monitoring System that specifically focus on traffic types found in modern enterprise networks (e.g., database traffic, file sharing traffic, etc.), to facilitate analysis of the characteristics of enterprise traffic.  The analysis required, however, that we grapple with a deep problem fundamental to the task: All network observations are approximations of reality - particularly their fine-grained timing - and therefore we must understand the general differences between our measurements and reality or the measurements may lead us to incorrect conclusions about what is happening in the network.  Therefore, as part of the development of our traffic analysis framework we conducted significant work in developing methods to calibrate our measurements to ensure we understood what they show (and what they appeared to but did not).\n\nUnderstanding network traffic by looking at individual activity in measurements does not always illuminate problems.  Rather, we need to develop algorithms that correlate multiple observations to detect many phenomena.  Within this project we developed several algorithms to leverage disparate information to detect issues.  As an example, attackers will often try to gain access to an enterprise by guessing credentials needed to access some computer.  An attacker that uses one computer to launch many such guesses is straightforward to detect.  However, an attacker that instead guesses very infrequently and from a variety of remote computers is much more difficult to detect.  We developed an algorithm that is able to detect such stealthy attacks.  Using data gathered from one of our partners - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory - we were able to find dozens of attacks that had previously gone undetected.  The most noteworthy facet of our approach is that it can be applied to any situation where anomalous activity occurs in a broadly distributed fashion that is pointwise undetectable, providing that the activity manifests as a change (however slender) in a property of the site's aggregate network activity.\n\nOur work in designing algorithms to find various issues within enterprise networks showed the need for a systematic approach to gathering and analyzing data from across the enterprise.  We therefore developed a system called VAST - Visibility Across Space and Time - that can efficiently archive huge volumes of network observations at a massive scale.  VAST can both (1) store large amounts of data from a variety of sources (e.g., many different traffic monitors within an enterprise network, each generating its own type of data) and (2) allow network operators to rapidly query the stored observations to better understand the operation of the network.  VAST leverages our traffic analyzers as data providers and in turn provides operators with an interface to the data such that phenomenon-detection algorithms can illuminate a variety of network issues.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vern Paxson"
