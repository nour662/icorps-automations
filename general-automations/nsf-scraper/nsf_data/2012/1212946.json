 "awd_abstract_narration": "1212946\r\nErvin\r\nThis proposal seeks partial support for student participation in the 2012 Central States Section of the Combustion Institute Biennial Technical Meeting. This meeting is a forum where combustion researchers from academia, federal government, and industry gather to discuss the newest developments and research in combustion science and technology. The meeting will be hosted by the University of Dayton on April 22-24, 2012 in Dayton, OH. The topics that will be covered at this meeting include combustion fundamentals (e.g., soot and NOx formation), applications (e.g., gas turbines), and enabling research for combustion (e.g., diagnostics and computational techniques).\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: In view of the increasing role of combustion in efficiently using energy resources as well as the strong dependence of CO2 and other emissions on combustion processes, it is vital that combustion researchers from across the United States meet together to present and discuss relevant concepts and technologies. It is believed that the proposed activity is of high intellectual merit due to the anticipated quality of the presentations. Thought provoking discussion generated in this meeting in the areas of sustainable combustion, alternative fuels, combustion diagnostics, and innovative combustion concepts will lead to the formation of new ideas.\r\n\r\nBroad Impacts: This meeting is a tremendous opportunity for graduate students to interact with leading researchers in the field of combustion from academia, federal government laboratories, and industry. This meeting will not only serve as a venue for the discussion of the newest developments in combustion science and technology but also as a chance for graduate students to form long-term collaborations. In addition, the meeting will permit students to discover new research activities that they may pursue in the future. The meeting will serve as an important component of graduate student education and will assist in the development of the next generation of combustion scientists and engineers.",
