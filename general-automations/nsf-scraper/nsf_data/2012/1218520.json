 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile computing is sweeping the world.  Recent studies are pointing to the permanent storage in mobile computing platforms being a weak link. Due to considerations of power and physical footprint, flash has been the storage technology of choice hitherto in mobile platforms. Flash and other newer storage technologies, such as PCM and STT-RAM, have their own idiosyncrasies both from the point of view of architecting them and integrating them in the operating system.  In this project, we focus on the system software and hardware issues, in an integrated fashion, in the construction of high-performance storage architecture for mobile platforms.   We will analyze the source of storage-related performance bottlenecks on mobile platforms at different levels of the software stack using a combination of measurement, simulation, and real implementation on existing and emerging mobile platforms. We will propose solutions both at the system software and architecture levels for advancing the state-of-the-art in storage for mobile platforms, and conduct detailed quantitative evaluation of our solutions.  This project with its focus on advancing the state-of-the-art in mobile storage technology can have unexpected economic and societal impact.  We intend to make the research artifacts from this project (traces, workloads, and software) available to the broader research community through open source efforts.  Despite technological advances, system software has lagged significantly behind the hardware in delivering the expected performance. The vision behind this project is an attempt to bridge this gap for the storage side of the system software stack through an integrated hardware/software approach.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMobile computing is sweeping the world. According to recent statistics, there are up to 4 billion mobile users (more than half of the world?s population), with accelerated penetration in regions such as India and Africa. This trend is even more significant in the light of predictions about mobile devices dominating most personal computing landscape in the near future. Recent studies are pointing to the permanent storage in such devices being a weak link. Due to considerations of power and physical footprint, flash has been the storage technology of choice hitherto in mobile platforms.  Flash has its own idiosyncrasies and performance quirks, which can make storage the Achilles?s heel in the performance of mobile platforms.  Further, with the explosion in multimedia content (audio, video, and photos), the user is always finding the local storage on their mobile devices inadequate.\n\nIn this research, we tackled these two issues.  Recognizing that mobile devices are often used as terminal devices for content that is in the Cloud, we devised mechanisms to improve the storage performance circumventing the idiosyncrasies of flash using system-wide context information.  We also devised context-sensitive caching mechanisms to seamlessly extend the local storage to the Cloud while being aware of the user?s preferences.  One of the most difficult aspects of mobile research is conducting user studies and data collection.  Through the mBench framework, we have devised a way to democratize data collection for the mobile research community.  Another key accomplishment from this research is the flashstream multi-tiered storage technology aimed at storing and serving video assets from the Cloud to the mobile devices.  Given that video is the dominant traffic on the Internet, there is a market potential for the flashstream technology, and such technology transfer from academia to industry is being explored.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Umakishore Ramachandran"
