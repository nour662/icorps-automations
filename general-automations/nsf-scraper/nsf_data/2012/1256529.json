Carry out a phenomenological study of faculty members' justifications for instructional choices to better understand the rationale underlying the pedagogical approaches to the teaching of STEM-related core courses, \r\n\r\n3. Conduct a curriculum mapping of the STEM-related core courses to document the focus of faculty members' instructional practices to better understand the relationship between the knowledge and skills taught within and across STEM-related core courses for STEM majors and non-majors, \r\n\r\n4. Conduct an outcomes assessment of students' (a) learning of essential content, (b) complex cognition, and (c) epistemological belief to understand the practical outcomes of evidence-based instructional practices for STEM majors and non-majors in STEM-related core courses, \r\n\r\n5. Design, develop, and implement a pilot program based on the findings of the needs assessment, phenomenological study, curriculum mapping, and outcomes assessments.",
