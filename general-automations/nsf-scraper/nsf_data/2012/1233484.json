 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Scharf, Michael\r\nProposal Number: 1233484\r\nInstitution: Purdue University\r\nTitle: Engineering of termite-derived biocatalysts for use in sustainable energy production\r\n\r\nThis project aims to engineer novel processes for breakdown of 2nd generation (i.e., non-food) bioenergy feedstocks that are modeled after metabolic processes occurring in the gut of the termite Reticulitermes flavipes.\r\n\r\nTermites are well known for their abilities feed upon, digest, and receive nourishment from diets comprised exclusively of lignocellulose. This ability to digest lignocellulose is made possible by specialized termite gut physiology as well as enzymes produced by termites and their gut symbionts. Termites of the genus Reticulitermes (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) are the most common termites in North America. The PI and co-PI?s recently completed efforts to sequence from the R. flavipes gut transcriptome and gut symbiont meta-transcriptome (>360,000 sequence reads) have revealed an abundance of previously unknown genes related not only to lignocellulose digestion, but also to a number of important energy-related processes. However, a functional understanding of the entire process of termite lignocellulose digestion and more specifically, how these metabolic processes can be engineered for industrial biofuels production, remain largely unrealized. This lack of understanding hinders the development of potentially important biocatalysts and processes for use in sustainable bioenergy production. The overall goals of this research are to utilize termite gut sequence (transcriptome and proteome) information to engineer sustainable strategies for 2nd-generation biofuel production from non-food agricultural feedstocks that are economical, sustainable and non-invasive. \r\n\r\nThis project has three specific aims: Aim 1 is to identify host and symbiont genes that are differentially expressed after feeding on different agricultural feedstocks; Aim 2 is to identify dominant proteins and enzyme activities that correspond to feedstock-responsive genes identified from aim 1; and Aim 3 is to use information obtained in aims 1 and 2 to develop and engineer optimally-active recombinant enzyme cocktails. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will advance scientific enquiry while promoting teaching and learning. In particular, this research will have broad impacts on society at-large, as well as through its integration of research and education, and impacts on underrepresented groups. The broad societal impacts of the proposed research include (1) development of biofuels technology, (2) enhancement of U.S. agriculture, (3) developing a deeper understanding of microbial ecology and symbioses, (4) education of the general public and fellow scientists on termite biology, and (5) developing a deeper understanding of physiological characteristics of termites that make them pests. In terms of integrating research and education, the proposed research will engage scientists at multiple levels of education and professional development ranging from the K-12 level, to undergraduate and graduate-level college students, post-doctoral associates, and young faculty.",
