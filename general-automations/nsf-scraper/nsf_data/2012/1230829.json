 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction\r\n\r\nDespite widespread acceptance of the idea that humans are not the only conscious creatures on the planet, and a resurgence of scientific work and public interest in the topic of animal consciousness, considerable scientific skepticism and divergent public opinion remains concerning what it actually means to say that animals are conscious. This project addresses two related research questions. How is consciousness conceptualized in different research contexts? Can the various and seemingly incompatible conceptualizations of animal consciousness be integrated or related in an evidence-based way? \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe project will use the methods of conceptual and logical analysis of scientific and philosophical positions to generate a series of research publications on this topic, and will initiate an \"Online Tree of Consciousness\" to serve as an open database for research, education, ethics, and policy in this area. The project will provide a clear characterization of existing concepts and methods from multiple disciplines. The goal is to integrate these into a single domain of discourse organized around phylogenetic relationships among the species that have been studied. This will allow different sorts of evidence (behavioral, neurophysiological, evolutionary, etc.) to be evaluated in their phylogenetic context, and should aid in the discovery of patterns in existing data as well as helping to identify systematically understudied areas. \r\n\r\nPotential Broader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe project is expected to yield general recommendations and guidelines for future scientific work, greater conceptual clarity about the range of ideas about animal consciousness and how to study it, improved accessibility for policymakers and ethicists concerned with animal welfare to the latest research on consciousness, better access for social scientists to data relevant to the historical and sociological patterns of animal consciousness research, and easy access for educators looking to challenge students with one of the hardest and most fascinating conceptual problems facing any science.",

The modal breadth of consciousness. Philosophical Psychology.\n\nAbstract: In this paper, I argue that the intentional structure of typical human conscious experience has \"modal breadth\"&mdash;that the contents of experience typically include alternate possibilities. I support this claim with analyses of conscious mental processes such as the perception of temporally extended events, persistent objects, and causality, and the experience of bodily agency. While modal breadth may not be strictly necessary for consciousness per se, it is essential to many cognitive processes that are pervasive and functionally important to normal human consciousness. \n\n \n\n2. The Cambrian Explosion and the Origins of Embodied Cognition. Biological Theory\n\nAbstract: Around 540 million years ago there was a sudden, dramatic adaptive radiation known as the Cam- brian Explosion. This event marked the origin of almost all of the phyla (major lineages characterized by fundamental body plans) of animals that would ever live on Earth, as well as the appearance of many notable features such as rigid skeletons and other hard parts, complex jointed appendages, eyes, and brains. This radical evolutionary event has been a major puzzle for evolutionary biologists since Darwin, and while our understanding of it has recently improved with new fossil finds, richer molecular phylogenies, and better grasp of ecological, evolutionary, and developmental processes generally, unanswered ques- tions remain. In this article I argue that a basic cognitive toolkit for embodied, object-oriented, spatial cognition&mdash; what I call Basic Cognitive Embodiment&mdash;is a practical necessity for control of a large, mobile, complexly articu- lated body in space. This hypothesis allows us to relate the complexification of animal bodies to the complexification of perception, cognition, and behavior in a way that can help to fill in gaps in our emerging picture of the Cambrian Explosion, as well as shed light on the deep evolutionary origins of the mind. \n\n\n\n\n\n3. Clever Hans, Alex the Parrot, and Kanzi: What can Exceptional Animal Learning Teach us About Human Cognitive Evolution?\n\nAbstract: The development of cognitive capacities depends on environmental conditions, including various forms of scaffolding. As a result, the evolution of cognition depends on the evolution of activities that provide scaffolding for cognitive development. Non-human animals reared and trained in environments heavily scaffolded with human social interaction can acquire non-species-typical knowledge, skills, and capacities. This can potentially shed light on some of the changes that paved the way for the evolution of distinctively human behavioral capacities such as language, advanced social cognition, and elaborate forms of tool craft. In this light, I revisit several widely known&mdash;but also widely misunderstood&mdash;cases of exceptional animals and argue that each of these cases provides clues about key innovations in our own evolutionary history. \n\n4. \"Animal Consciousness\", The..."
