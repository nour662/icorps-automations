Most experimental force measurements with microtubules have been performed in vitro and are not directly relevant to what happens in vivo.  As a result, the microtubule force balance remains unclear. This project aims to develop and validate a biologically relevant model for the forces generated on microtubules by motor proteins.  The project offers a new paradigm for investigating force generation in cells, by severing individual microtubules with a laser in living cells, and using numerical models of microtubule mechanics to interpret the measurements. \r\n\r\nMost essential mammalian cell functions, including migration and cell division, involve force generation by semi-flexible biopolymers called microtubules. An understanding of how the forces generated by motor proteins affect the shapes and thus the function of microtubules in the cell has applications in a number of fields: cellular transport, cytoskeletal mechanics and cell biology, engineering applications in nanobiotechnology and the understanding of diseases such as cancer. The project promotes a collaborative partnership between multiple investigators, involving experiments, modeling and simulations. The numerical model will form the basis for a long-term development of simulations of the mechanics of the cytoskeleton. In addition, the project contributes to the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students in a diverse, multidisciplinary environment.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Physics of Living Systems in Physics Division.",
