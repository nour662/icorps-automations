 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this research is to understand how plants perceive changes in their light environment, transduce that information, and ultimately alter growth and development to elicit appropriate adaptive responses.  In this project, the phototropic response, or directional growth of a plant toward or away from light, is being used as a model response to understand the molecular components underlying plant light responses.  In particular, physiological, genetic, biochemical, and molecular approaches will be utilized to study the mechanism(s) by which a specific light receptor, phototropin 1, is capable of converting a directional light signal into a physiological response in the plant.  Results from these studies will provide important insights not only into the mechanisms of phototropic signaling but receptor-mediated signaling in general.  Because surface and intracellular receptors are utilized by all cells (bacterial, fungal, plant, and animal) to sense environmental cues, results from this work has a potential impact on a variety of human endeavors, from agriculture to medicine.  Though such impacts are likely long-term, direct and tangible impact of this project on our nation will be realized through training of young scientists (one technician, at least two PhD students, and three undergraduate students).  Moreover, the proposed outreach to local K-12 schools will have a clear and immediate impact on science education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project aimed to better understand the molecular, biochemical, and cellular consequences of post-translational phosphorylation and ubiquitination on the internalization and desensitization of the blue light photoreceptor phototropin 1.  While previous studies had already identified serine and threonine amino acid residues on phototropin 1 that were targeted for phosphorylation, we had to identify the site(s) of ubiquitination.  This was done by a comination of genetic and biochemical methods, and lead to the identification of lysines 526, 527 and 899 as the most critical amino acid targets.  While both lys 526 and 527 are ubiquitinated in response to blue light, neither requires the ubiquitin ligase adapter protein NPH3, suggesting that these may not be essential for phototropin 1 function.  However, mutation of lysines 526/527 to arginines alters the phototropic response of plants, suggesting that this phototropin 1-dependen response does utilize lys526/527 ubiquitination.  In contrast, lys899 is ubiquitinated in both a blue light- and NPH3-dependent fashion putting it squarely at the center of potential phototropin 1 function.  Unfortunately mutation of lys899 to arginine did not alter phototropic responsiveness suggesting that another lys become the target of ubiquitination in the absence of lys899.  This is common in protein ubiquitination.  There are several additional lys residues close to the 899 site and we will be examining these for there function in future studies.  We also generated a phototropin protein that has all 80 lysine residues present converted to arginines to prevent any ubiquitination and this protein appears to lack physiological function, though future studies are necessary to determine exactly what the defects are.  Phototropin 1 internaliztion appears to not require ubiquitination, although phosphorylation does appear important.  However, the degragation and densensitization of phototropin 1 does appear to be modulated by both post-translational modifications.  Moreover, we have found that phototropin 1 moves very dynamically within the membrane, something previously undescribed, and that this intra-membrane movement may be more critical than movement off the membrane for physiological function.  Phototropin 1 ubiquitination is important for this intra-membrane movement.  Results from these studies have defined more precisely the roles of phototropin 1 phosphorylation and ubiquitination, and provide a basis for a large number of future studies that can address the function of this important light receptor.  These studies also provided a platform for the training of 5 PhD students and at least 5 undergraduates at the University of Missouri.  Each of these students learned intellectual and technical skills that can now be taken to the market to advance US science and technology.  The studies performed in this project also provide new insights that we will be exploiting in future studies to apply to agricultural problems, such as biomass production and drought tolerance. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Emmanuel Liscum"
