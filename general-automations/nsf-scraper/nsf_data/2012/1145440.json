 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nematodes are frequently considered the most diverse, abundant, and ubiquitous animals on earth. This assertion however, is not strongly supported by the number of formally described species. The gap between formally recognized species and species yet to be discovered has been referred to as the \"biodiversity identification gap.\" This gap is thought to exist due to difficulties in identifying diagnostic characters in nematodes, overlapping intra- and inter-specific variation, and the lack of taxonomists engaged in the activity of species discovery and description. An important factor that has not been generally addressed is the actual process of species delimitation in the field of nematology. This proposal focuses on the role of species delimitation through an integrated taxonomic examination of a select group of soil-dwelling, plant parasitic nematodes in the family Criconematidae. \r\n\r\nThe species delimitation process will improve our ability to diagnose nematode species and contribute to the development of a plant-parasitic nematode biogeography. The project will incorporate young aspiring scientists and citizen scientists using nematodes as a bridge to the microbial world. Together with the nonprofit organization Discover Life in America, surveys and workshops will be conducted at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, serving as a model for other parks and preserves.",

One famous quote suggests that if all matter on earth were eliminated except nematodes, all the basic features of the world would still be recognizable including the location of various plant and animal species. Yet given this acclaimed status, it is surprising how little we know about the geographic distribution of these microscopic animals. Our study focuses on a family of root-feeding plant parasites, the Criconematidae, known as the ring nematodes due to their prominent, annulated cuticle. These nematodes are common in the soils of native plant communities and several species are important pests in orchards, vineyards, and turf. We have discovered that when examined at the level of DNA, many of these common ring nematode species are actually composed of multiple genetically distinct subgroups. And the subgroups themselves are distributed locally, with more geographically distant subgroups exhibiting a greater genetic distance. This distribution pattern suggests that the nematode parasites have evolved gradually, perhaps in concert with their preferred plant host species. Over time the soil nematode communities, in the absence of long distance dispersal, have altered to the point where they essentially are local endemics, with their composite genotypes potentially serving as a &ldquo;genetic fingerprint&rdquo; for a specific locality. Therefore, from the perspective of achieving accurate biodiversity assessments, it is important to use molecular techniques that provide the proper level of taxonomic resolution. From the perspective of identifying agricultural pests, similar levels of resolution may be necessary to identify nematode subgroups that differ physiologically. During the course of this project, dozens of new species have been discovered that are in the process of being formally described. &nbsp;Ironically, the same molecular techniques used to discover these species indicate that the traditional categories used to classify these species are inadequate to group this increased level of diversity. We have had to reevaluate species, genus, and subfamily boundaries in order to accommodate this new diversity.&nbsp; All of the data generated in this project are being added to the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) to serve as a repository that can be publically accessed and evaluated. Collection data, images, measurements, and DNA sequences will be online once the data is validated. &nbsp;This reference database currently contains approximately 1,300 annotated specimens of ring nematodes. With the addition of specimens presently in the discovery process, this database will provide the largest collection of molecularly and morphologically characterized plant-parasitic nematodes native to North America. This resource should aid investigations into the historical processes that have structured present day plant and animal distributions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/29/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Thomas&nbsp;O&nbsp;Powers</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1145440/1145440_10181038_1472516174970_Diversity-of-Criconematids--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1145440/1145440_10181038_1472516174970_Diversity-of-Criconematids--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Criconematidae, the ring nematodes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1145440/1145440_10181038_1472516174970_Diversity-of-Criconematids--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Criconematidae, the ring nematodes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Microscopic ring nematodes, members of the plant-parasitic nematode family Criconematidae.
