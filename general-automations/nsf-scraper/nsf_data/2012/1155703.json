 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic-rich habitat islands support specialized communities throughout natural ecosystems and often play fundamental roles in maintaining alpha and beta diversity, thus facilitating adaptive radiation and evolutionary novelty. Whale-bone and wood falls occur widely in the deep-sea and contribute fundamentally to biodiversity and evolutionary novelty; nonetheless, large-scale patterns of biodiversity, connectivity, and ecosystem function in these organic-rich metacommunity systems remain essentially unexplored. \r\n\r\nThe PIs propose a novel comparative experimental approach to evaluate bathymetric, regional, and inter-basin variations in biodiversity and connectivity, as well as interactions between biodiversity and ecosystem function, in whale-bone and wood-fall habitats at the deep-sea floor. Their experiments will use bottom landers to carry and hold samples of bone and wood and a control substrate (basalt) at two depths (1500 and 3000 m), 250-500 km apart, in the NE Pacific and SW Atlantic basins, with quantitative recovery of the colonizing assemblages 15 month later.  Each depth will have three replicates.  Their experiments will test fundamental hypotheses concerning biodiversity (genetic and taxonomic) and biogeography of macrofaunal and microbial organisms exploiting these resource-rich habitats in energy limited deep-sea environments, and will explore the utility of whale-bone and wood falls as model experimental systems to address patterns of connectivity and decomposer function in the deep sea. \r\n\r\nThe project will have broader impacts in five areas: (1) At least two graduate students will conduct Ph.D. research, and three undergraduate students will participate in research cruises and develop senior theses within the project.  (2) Project results will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses at two universities. (3) The PIs will develop and deliver a new a graduate-level summer course at Friday Harbor Laboratory entitled Deep-Sea Biodiversity, Connectivity and EcosystemFunction based on project results.  A similar course will be offered at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil at no cost to NSF. (4) Public outreach will include project web sites and cruise blogs at both the University of Hawaii (UH) and Auburn University, and presentations at UH and Auburn open houses. (5) Results will be presented at conservation forums such as  the annual meeting of Pew Fellows in Marine Conservation.",

Whale bones and wood falls provide organic-rich habitat islands at the normally food-poor deep-sea floor and support remarkable communities; nonetheless, large-scale patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem function in these food-rich habitat islands remain essentially unexplored. We developed a novel experimental approach, using deep-sea bottom landers (Fig. 1), to emplace large whale bones and wood blocks at controlled locations on the seafloor in two ocean basins. With these experiments, we explored how biodiversity and decomposition vary for whale bones and wood falls as a function of ocean depth, distance along an ocean margin, and between the North Pacific and South Atlantic. We deployed multiple landers at two ocean depths (1500 and 3000 m) separated by 250 &ndash; 500 km in the NE Pacific and SW Atlantic basins (in collaboration with Brazilian colleagues) and recovered the landers, together with rich communities of animals and microbes living on the wood and bone, after ~15 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We used a variety of techniques (including DNA sequencing, morphological studies, and photographic and x-radiographic imaging) to analyze faunal and microbial assemblages on recovered whale bones and wood blocks. &nbsp;A high diversity of animals colonized our experiments, with 188 species found across all bone/wood substrates on the Oregon-Washington margin, including many species new to science. Fourteen species were unique to whalebones, 32 species to wood blocks, and 69 species were shared across all substrates.</p>\n<p>Wood blocks at 1500 m were heavily colonized and decomposed by wood-boring clams (genus <em>Xylophaga</em>) (Fig. 2), while blocks at 3000 m sustained little colonization and degradation, indicating that wood decomposition varies dramatically with ocean depth. Heavily degraded wood blocks had extremely high abundances of a new species of flatworm and a diversity of other invertebrates (Fig. 2). The abundance and diversity of wood-dwelling fauna were strongly correlated with the both abundance of the wood-boring clam and the weight of wood lost through its borings, indicating that <em>Xylophaga</em> is a key ecosystem engineer, increasing the availability of food and habitat space on sunken wood.</p>\n<p>Degradation of whale bones by the bone-eating worms <em>Osedax</em> was limited (Fig. 3), with only 19 individual <em>Osedax</em> colonizing all 12 bone substrates after 15 months.
