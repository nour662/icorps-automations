 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports collaborative research between Professor Robert Bartynski of Rutgers University at New Brunswick and Professor Elena Galoppini at Rutgers University at Newark on the synthesis and characterization of tunable linker dipoles for improved solar energy conversion devices. This research, which brings together a synthetic chemist and a surface physicist, aims to achieve precise control of the electronic properties of the interface between an organic molecule and a semiconductor by tailoring the properties of the organic overlayer at the molecular level. Ultimately, this work will enhance the fundamental understanding and performance of organic-inorganic and organic-organic hybrid materials that are used in a wide variety of application areas including molecular electronics and photovoltaics. By molecular design of a variety of functional organic compounds, the research team will modify molecular energy levels (HOMO-LUMO) alignment, tune the donation and withdrawal of charge, and influence molecule bonding geometries at organic molecule/semiconductor interfaces.  This will be accomplished using compounds with a Head-Linker-Anchor (HLA) configuration bound to metal oxide (TiO2 and ZnO) or organic (rubrene) semiconductor surfaces. The head groups (H) will be either organic chromophores or electron donor or acceptor groups, and the linker units (L) will contain an internal molecular dipole.  The rigid linkers will be designed to bind at a well-defined orientation and distance from the semiconducting organic or inorganic surfaces. The electronic structure, dye-oxide energy level alignment, binding geometry, and effects of intermolecular interactions of HLA compounds on semiconductor substrates will be studied using a wide array, state-of-the-art ultrahigh vacuum-based surface characterization techniques. Spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements will complement the surface studies.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research, derived mainly from molecular level control of the organic/semiconductor interface, will touch many areas of science and technology including photocatalytic materials, photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and other devices. The educational component of the program will generate two innovative research modules where students gain hands-on experience that will solidify the connection between basic scientific research and technological advances that benefit society.  Students will build simple  solar cells based on molecules similar to those used in this research, but found in everyday items. The modules are easily adaptable for undergraduate laboratories at the two Rutgers campuses, and for demonstrations that will involve K-12 students. These activities will target underrepresented groups including high-school students from the Newark urban area.  Student exchanges and co-advising of Ph.D. theses are integral to the program and the interdisciplinary collaboration between a synthetic chemist and a physicist will broaden the scientific education and training of the students from both laboratories.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     The focus of the research carried out under this grant is to characterize and understand the underlying mechanisms that determine the geometric and electronic properties of organic molecules on metal, oxide, and organic semiconductor surfaces.  These interfaces are essential components of next generation devices such as organic light emitting diodes, thin film transistors, and solar cells.  The goal of the research is to establish guiding principles that will enable the formation of interfaces with desirable characteristics.  The research has had important outcomes in each of these areas. With regard to organic molecules on metal surfaces, we have found that organic molecules can be driven to shed selective hydrogens along their periphery, leading to products that can subsequently form intermolecular covalent bonds.  This may be used to create new one- and two-dimensional carbon-based materials with, for example, unusual magnetic properties that may be used to store or transmit information much more efficiently than is possible with currently available materials.  In addition, organic molecules often self-assemble in ordered metastable arrays, which, through non-thermally induced intermolecular covalent bonding, may lead to an even more diverse family of low-dimensional materials.\n\n     An essential property of interfaces between dissimilar materials is the energy alignment of the occupied and unoccupied electronic orbitals of each material.  This alignment determines the barrier that charge carriers must overcome when traveling form one material to the other.  Through study of several organic molecules, with systematically different electronegativities, on the TiO2(110) surface, we have found a universal behavior that can account for the way in which the levels of the organic molecule and those of the oxide match energetically. Through a coordinated experimental and theoretical effort, we found that all cases could be characterized by a universal curve that depends upon the separation between the lowest energy empty electron state of the oxide and the highest energy occupied electron orbital of the molecule.  This universal behavior has predictive powers and can guide the choice of materials to provide a desired barrier for charge carriers passing through the interface.\n\n     Organic semiconductors, such as rubrene, have many properties that are highly complementary to those of standard inorganic semiconductors such as Si or Ge, such as mechanical flexibility and ease of synthesis.  Earlier studies have found that forming a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on the rubrene surface comprised of molecules with electron-withdrawing character (typically fluorinated alkane chains) can increase the rubrene conductivity by several orders of magnitude.  However, the way in which these molecule form the SAM, and what molecular properties determine whether the overlayer forms the desired 2D SAM forms or agglomerates into 3D polymer islands is not well understood.  Through a systematic study, varying the anchor group (which bonds to the rubrene), the length of the alkene tail, and the degree of fluorination, we have been able to establish guidelines for selecting the type of molecule that will favor 2D SAM growth.  This will allow new degrees of flexibility and control of the charge transport properties, not only of rubrene, but also of other organic semiconductors.      \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert A Bartynski"
