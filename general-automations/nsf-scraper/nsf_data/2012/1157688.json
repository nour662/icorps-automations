 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  RNA polymerase II (Pol II) reads genetic information by synthesizing messenger RNA from DNA in the process termed transcription.  Mediator is a large multi-protein complex that regulates most, if not all, gene transcription by Pol II. It functions as a co-activator by conveying signals from DNA regulatory sequences to Pol II and a set of general transcription factors (GTFs) that assemble at the promoter to form a pre-initiation complex (PIC) for transcription initiation. Mediator is evolutionarily conserved in all eukaryotes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mediator is composed of 21 subunits, with a total mass of over 1 megaDalton, organized into three three distinct modules, termed Head, Middle/Arm and Tail. Since Mediator's function in PIC assembly is proposed to involve direct interactions with Pol II and GTFs, structural information of functional surfaces within Mediator that interact with GTFs and Pol II is required to understand the mechanisms of Mediator functions. However, the large size and complexity of Mediator has greatly impeded structural studies of these questions. This fundamental bottleneck has been overcome recently by determining a crystal structure of the Mediator Head module at 4.3A resolution. This Mediator module comprises 7 subunits with a molecular mass of 223 kDa and is essential for Mediator function. The Head structure revealed a number of structural features that may be responsible for recruitment and coordination of the PIC. These observations led to the hypothesis that Mediator provides functional surfaces with which transcription factors and Pol II interact to bring about transcriptional regulation. To test this hypothesis, this project will determine functional surfaces by taking a structure-guided mutagenesis approach to improve the resolution of the current structure. Structural and functional studies will be combined to determine how the Head module of Mediator interacts with a module of Pol II. Together, the results will provide a picture of how Mediator spatially coordinates different components of the transcription machinery to facilitate a sequence of event leading to transcription initiation. Such structural and functional insights will greatly transform understanding of gene expression regulation by Mediator.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  This project will provide research training opportunities for Indiana University graduate students and for undergraduate students from Indiana University, Purdue University at Indianapolis through the Life-Health Science Internship program. Research training opportunities will also be available for summer students through the STEM program for undergraduate minority students and the Indy SEED project for underprivileged high school students. Students will learn and implement cutting-edge technologies, including the latest molecular cloning and protein complex engineering technologies, X-ray crystallography, bioinformatics, biochemical assays, and yeast genetics.",

Since transcription by Pol II defines biological activities in eukaryotes, elucidation of transcription process is essential to understand biology. Mediator is an essential regulator in transcription. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is a large protein complex composed of 25 subunits with a total mass over 1 mega Daltons. Mediator is organized into 4 distinct sub-complexes termed, Head, Middle, Tail and the CDK8 modules.&nbsp; Head, Middle and Tail modules combined form a very stable so-call core Mediator (21-subunits); the CDK8 module (4 subunits) is dissociable from core Mediator and in some cases, it may function by its own. Despite of its fundamental importance, the mechanism of its function is largely unknown. To elucidate the mechanism, structure and functional characterization of the Mediator complex is essential. Our investigation has led to two major outcomes as follows:</p>\n<p>(i) Elucidation of the mechanism of transcription by Mediator: our investigation has revealed key regulatory mechanism of Mediator in transcription: the key role of Mediator is to recruit the one of the general transcription factors (GFTs), TFIIH, which will in turn facilitate transition of Pol II from initiation to elongation.&nbsp; While core Mediator facilitates transition of Pol II from initiation to elongation, the CDK8 module inhibits recruitment of TFIIH.&nbsp; In essence, we found that Mediator functions to regulate the efficiency of transition of Pol II from initiation to elongation by facilitation or inhibition of recruitment of TFIIH (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>(ii) Development of the Solubility-Enhancing-Protein assisted protein expression (SEP) system and its application to reconstitution of the entire Mediator: The biggest obstacle to reconstituting large multi-protein complexes lies in a difficulty expressing large subunits in soluble form. To solve this problem, we developed a unique baculovirus expression vector that allows for the expression of large proteins in insect cells. This unique vector system fuses an engineered polypeptide to the protein of interest, drastically improving the expression, solubility and stability of numerous otherwise problematic large proteins. We have named this technology &ldquo;Solubility-Enhancing-Protein assisted protein expression (SEP) system&rdquo; (unpublished, a provisional patent application has been filed). Using our new technology, we have succeeded reconstitution of the 18- subunit as well as the 21-subunit Mediator (Figure 2A, 2C). The preliminary EM data is shown in Figure 3D. We also succeeded in reconstituting the CDK8 module (Figure 2E). We obtained the low-resolution 3D reconstitution of the CDK8 module (Figure 3F). These outcomes will lead to structure determination of the entire 25-subunit Mediator complexes.
