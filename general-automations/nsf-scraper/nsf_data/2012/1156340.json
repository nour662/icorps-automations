 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site led by Professor Thomas R. Krugh at the University of Rochester. REU students will participate in a 10 week summer program. The primary focus for REU students will be full-time hands-on scientific research as a member of an established research team. Each participant will have a specific research problem, a specific faculty adviser, and a specific mentor to provide day-to-day advice. A weekly REU Group Meeting provides a forum for participants to report their research to each other early in the summer in the form of an oral presentation, and again at the end of the program in a poster presentation and final written report. Participants will learn from each other, and about other areas of chemistry in the oral and poster presentations. They will participate in a variety of social activities, the group will have sessions on careers, they will visit the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, and have a mini-course on entrepreneurship in chemistry. Recruitment of students will give emphasis to the participation of underrepresented minorities, women, and lower division students.\r\n\r\nUndergraduates will complete an independent research project, gain an appreciation of life as a graduate student in chemistry, participate in the excitement of discovery, gain in-depth knowledge in their research area, and be exposed to research in other areas through oral presentations and a poster session. The Group Meetings also will be used to discuss graduate education, scientific careers, responsible conduct of research and scientific ethics. Graduate student mentors will experience a valuable learning experience in leadership.",
