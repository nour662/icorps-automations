 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective engineering of complex devices often depends critically on the ability to encapsulate responsibility for tasks into modular agents and ensure those agents communicate with one another in well-defined and easily observable ways.  When such conditions are followed, it becomes possible to detect where problems lie so they can be corrected.  It also becomes possible to optimize the agents and their communications to improve performance.  Cyber-physical systems (like robots, self-piloting aircraft, etc.) modify themselves to improve performance break those conditions in that some agent modules negotiate their own communications and decide their own actions, sometimes taking advantage of the physics of the world in ways we did not anticipate.  This renders difficult application of standard engineering tools to accomplish critical fault diagnosis and design optimization.  This project will produce analysis methods address the specific needs of cyber-physical systems that, by their natures, break the rules of convention.  We will apply these new methods to the design and analysis of self-improving controllers for flapping-wing micro air vehicles.  \r\n\r\nThis work will provide advances in both model-checking related formal design methodologies and in module-based self-adaptive control in computationally resource constrained cyber-physical systems.  The formal methods advances will significantly expand our ability to properly design and verify systems that tightly couple computation, sensors, and actuators.  The specific test application addressed is significant to a number of nationally important security and defense efforts and will directly impact identified national priorities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe use of machine learning to adjust, repair, and optimize control algorithms and electronics is becoming commonplace.  Especially when the automated adjustments are made while the controlled system (robot, self-driving car, etc.) is in active service, it can be difficult to ensure the short and long term safety and efficacy of the changes. In this project, we developed specific methods to integrate machine learning based adaptation of control electronics and maintenance of underlying system models that enable the very long-term Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) methods that are often obliviated by the use of machine learning.\n\n Our methods were tested with a minimally-actuated Flapping-Wing Micro Air Vehicle (FW-MAV).  The device was minimally actuated in that it minimized the number and complexity of mechanics, motors, and sensors.  It was Flapping-Wing in that all flight propulsion and control was provided by two flapping wings much in the way an insect flies.  This problem was chosen because it provided significant challenges in real time adaptation (controller fixes must be constructed without interrupting the vehicle's flight mission or causing it to crash) and inference of faults and maintenance of V&amp;V models (the small number of sensors make it difficult to assess correctness or the health of internal components).\n\n We tested our integrated learning and model-inference methods against simulations of several generations of trial FW-MAVs constructed by this and affiliated projects.  We were able to show effective adaptation to wing tear faults while extracting estimates of the loss of force generation caused by those faults and updates to internal models that allowed the vehicle to assess the long-term consequence of those adaptations.  Late in the project, we extended these techniques to be able to detect and characterize faults due to loss of wing stiffness over the life of the wings.  Both of these conditions would be expected in actual service and, because of the minimally actuated nature of the device, difficult to assess in any other way.\n\nIntellectual Merits: The operation of Cyber-Physical Systems that closely intertwine real-world physical interaction with computer-based control and adaptation of that control can be difficult to predict, as they can act in ways that were not fully anticipated by their designers.  Such freedom of action is a benefit in the face of unexpected challenges, but can be a detriment to provision of long-term verification and validation.  This is especially true in systems where internal states of components may not be directly observable.  Our methods were able to intertwine control, adaptation, and inference of internal states in a way that preserves control efficacy and adaptability while still enabling model-based, long term, verification of behavior.  It is likely that these techniques can be adapted for use in other similarly constrained systems.\n\nBroader Impacts: We created a significant amount of infrastructure in support of the building and testing of FW-MAVs.  This unique test equipment and the data we have collected has had, and will continue to have, broad impact and influence on the design of flapping-wing vehicles beyond the scope of this specific project. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John C Gallagher"
