 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from the National Academy of Sciences is to support a planning and assessment activity by the Polar Research Board (PRB). Selected via standard NRC procedures, an ad hoc committee of 16 members will engage a broader segment of the Arctic research community in an information-gathering workshop. The workshop will assess the current state of research and supporting infrastructure and plan for emerging research questions in the Arctic over the next 10-20 years. The assessment will identify the key scientific questions in different realms of Arctic science, exploring both disciplinary realms (e.g., marine, terrestrial, atmosphere, cryosphere, and social sciences) and cross cutting realms (e.g., integrated systems science and sustainability science). Based on the emerging research questions, the study will also help identify research infrastructure needs (e.g., observation networks, computing and data management, ship requirements, shore facilities, etc.) and collaboration opportunities. The goal is to provide crisp, concise guidance for U.S. Arctic research so that research is targeted on critical scientific and societal questions and conducted as effectively as possible. An opportunity for additional, web-based community input will be offered. Existing community planning documents will be used, but synthesis and findings are the responsibility of the committee.",
