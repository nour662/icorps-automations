 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor David Tucker-Smith at Williams College.\r\n\r\nThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has already made enormous progress pushing forward the high energy frontier. During the coming years, the LHC will continue to probe some of the deepest mysteries in particle physics, including the origin of elementary particle masses and the nature of dark matter. In his research, Professor Tucker-Smith studies extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, with an emphasis on understanding how these theories can be tested at the LHC.  As part of this project, Professor Tucker-Smith will study models that address a surprising experimental development from the Tevatron at Fermilab --- measurements of an anomalously large forward-backward asymmetry in top-antitop production.  He will also study the LHC phenomenology of theories with a particular type of new force carrier, theories incorporating new ideas for dark matter, and theories in which the Higgs sector, the part of the model responsible for generating the masses of the elementary particles, differs from that of the Standard Model.\r\n\r\nThis project will also have signficant broader impacts.  Undergraduate involvement is a central part of the Professor Tucker-Smith's research program.  Students will have the opportunity to engage in particle physics research, and through their work they will learn important ideas, methods, and results relating to particle phenomenology and to theoretical physics in general.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Standard Model of particle physics (SM) encodes what we understand about elementary particles and their interactions.  This grant supported work to study theoretical extensions of the SM and to determine the implications of these theories for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other experiments.  Providing valuable research opportunities for undergraduates was an important goal, and nine Williams College students participated in research related to this grant.  \n\nExtra quarks and gauge bosons (force carriers) are predicted in various extensions of the SM and were a major focus of this research.  The existence of dark matter suggests that there may be particles that interact only very weakly with ordinary matter.  A hypothetical neutral gauge boson (Z?) with feeble interaction strength with SM particles could be relatively light while evading detection at previous colliders.  In this research we used Monte Carlo simulations to show that LHC data can be used to probe new parameter space for a light Z?.   We also studied the phenomenology of dark matter models in which Z? gauge bosons play a prominent role.  \n\nNew, heavy quarks are targets of many LHC experimental searches.  SM extensions involving new quarks often predict other new particles as well, and we studied how these might impact new quarks? experimental signatures at the LHC.  In particular, we investigated the possibility that the decay products of the new quarks might involve exotic ``sub-resonances?? that would in turn decay immediately to SM particles.  For concrete models we determined in which regions of parameter space this situation would arise, and we developed and tested strategies for simultaneously reconstructing the heavy quarks and the sub-resonances using collider data.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David R Tucker-Smith"
