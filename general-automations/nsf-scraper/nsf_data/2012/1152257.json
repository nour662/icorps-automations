 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address new regulations being enacted in\r\nthe shipping industry requiring Sulfur Oxides (SOx) reduction from engine emissions. Many commercial\r\nscrubber systems effectively remove SOx from engine emissions, yet none are designed to remove polycyclic\r\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). EnSolve?s approach is to develop a combined biological and mechanical\r\nsystem that can remove PAHs from the scrubber system waste water. The results of the Phase I study confirmed\r\nthe biomechanical approach was effective in reducing PAHs at rates exceeding 99%.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research will be to provide the maritime industry with a cost effective, reliable, and environmentally conscious treatment system for removing toxic substances from the world?s oceans. Ships will be required to either install scrubbing equipment or they will need to switch to more costly low sulfur fuels. A switch to low sulfur fuel would increase current fuel costs by over 88%. A commercial ship owner could realize annual savings of $2 million per vessel in fuel costs using a scrubber system compared with purchasing low sulfur fuel. An estimated 35,000 ships will be impacted by these regulations, yielding a market opportunity for the proposed scrubber water treatment system exceeding $5 billion. Other technologies under development utilize pure physical separation methods that transfer the contaminants from the scrubber water to another medium (i.e., filters) for disposal. Conversely, the proposed biological approach is a regenerative process that would significantly reduce landfill disposal, consumable, labor, and liability costs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis SBIR Phase II research was successfully completed by EnSolve Biosystems through development of a cost-effective solution to hydrocarbon and diesel particulate matter pollution prevention in maritime environments.  International regulations require Sulfur Oxides (SOx) reduction in ship engine emissions, necessitating ships to either switch to low sulfur fuels or install scrubber treatment systems.  Scrubber systems effectively remove SOx from engine emissions, however they are not designed to reduce regulated contaminants from the scrubber wash-water, requiring a treatment system to remove total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and particulate matter (PM) prior to discharge. \n\nThe overall goal of the research conducted in this project was to develop and install a biomechanical treatment system that reduces the contaminants to regulatory acceptable levels while providing a more cost effective and environmentally friendly solution than existing methods.  As a direct result of this NSF research, EnSolve has officially launched the EnScrub scrubber water treatment system for both shipboard and industrial use. \n\nEnSolve completed all the project objectives:  the EnScrub system was developed, installed, improved, and operated aboard commercial vessels.  Field trials demonstrated that the biological component was not required in most maritime installations as the PAHs regularly adhered to the PM and were removed by the automated filtration system.  The effluent of the EnScrub system has been discharged to surrounding waters because it meets regulatory acceptable concentrations for legal discharge. \n\nAdditionally, the EnScrub technology has been adapted for use in other high-saline environments where bioremediation was previously not an option for treatment.  This technology has since been utilized at an oil refinery in treating scrubber water with saline concentrations up to 8%.  The Phase II research showed that biological treatment is effective using EnSolve?s approach in environments with sodium sulfate concentrations up to 15%. \n\nThe EnScrub system has been well received by shipping companies and scrubber manufacturers alike.  The market for shipboard scrubber systems, and the resulting wash-water treatment systems, is rapidly developing, with an estimated 3-billion-dollar market for the water treatment system alone.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard L Penny"
