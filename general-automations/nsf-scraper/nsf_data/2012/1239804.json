 "awd_abstract_narration": "The YouTeach Noyce scholarship program is supporting 28 undergraduate chemistry and physics  majors to become highly qualified 7-12th grade physical science teachers. The program is partnering with and enhancing YouTeach, the University of Arkansas' UTeach replication site. This project is aiding the growth of YouTeach by increasing the number of participants through scholarship support and by allowing more advanced undergraduates to join the program with the support of a Master Teacher (MT). The MT is also providing induction support to the early graduates. All Noyce scholars are receiving additional training and support in the teaching demands of the high-need classroom from the MT beyond that called for by the UTeach model. Special attention is being paid to the recruiting and support of a diverse teacher community. \r\n\r\nThe Noyce scholars are benefiting from the extensive connections with local school districts and teachers that have grown out of previous funded projects including Fayetteville Public Schools, Fort Smith Public Schools, Siloam Springs School District, and Springdale Public Schools. The leadership team is well placed in national professional organizations to make lessons learned through this project available at the national level. This project is developing a lasting model of the cooperation of physics and chemistry departments to produce science teachers, most of whom will teach both chemistry and physics as the new licensure in Arkansas requires expertise in teaching both disciplines.\r\n\r\nPlacement of 28 qualified physical science teachers in Arkansas classrooms is improving STEM education and encouraging matriculation into STEM majors by students in high-needs classrooms across a state with very poor college attendance rates. Integration into Professional Learning Communities developed as part of the College Ready MSP is providing professional support and informing teachers of the barriers to college attendance. All recruiting activities are being carefully documented to form a resource that will be published and featured in the PTEC library, a component of comPADRE and PhysTEC.",
