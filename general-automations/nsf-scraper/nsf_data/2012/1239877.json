The intent is to arrive at a far-reaching overview of the evolution of microelectronics in the coming decade or more, as perceived by leading practitioners in the field. The major goal of the workshop is to assess the current status, define future research directions in microelectronics and to establish collaborations between researchers. This will be achieved through presentations and open discussions of the key technical issues.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: \r\nIt is expected that this Workshop will be instrumental in defining the research required by the growing demands of microelectronics in the coming decade. This workshop will also contribute to the training of participating students and the topics will be disseminated through the Conference Technical Digest.",
