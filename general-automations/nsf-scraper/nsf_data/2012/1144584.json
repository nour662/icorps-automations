 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award supports training in engineering and rehabilitation sciences to prepare future scientists who have a deep understanding of human function and needs, and can design innovative rehabilitation devices, systems, and techniques to help people with disabilities more fully participate in society.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This program focuses on technology innovations related to mobility, manipulation, and cognitive/behavioral limitations. A key feature of this IGERT award is in-depth technical and clinical training with each trainee being advised by a mentor team with expertise in engineering and a clinical discipline. This program is distinguished by its ability to attract high proportions of students with disabilities and veterans. The relevance of rehabilitation engineering to real life serves as an attractor for these students, allowing them the opportunity to improve their own lives and the lives of other people. Additionally, trainees will be introduced to entrepreneurship and commercialization through coursework, invited speakers, and multidisciplinary team competitions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This program is intended to make a contribution to a generation of a technically savvy, clinically astute, and innovation-minded workforce in the field of rehabilitation science and engineering. It will contribute to the basic understanding of how to create deeper collaborations between the clinical science and engineering communities to create enabling solutions for people with disabilities, how to structure graduate programs so that they are more effective in attracting and retaining a diverse set of graduate students, and how to take better advantage of the multinational character of the rehabilitation communities to improve the quality of graduate education.\r\n\r\nIGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to establish new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, and to engage students in understanding the processes by which research is translated to innovations for societal benefit.\r\n\r\n",

Our program consistently demonstrated the ability to produce high-achieving students who are leaders in and out of the classroom. A major objective of our IGERT was to provide meaningful opportunities for all individuals seeking educational and career opportunities in STEM. At HERL, we place a premium on mentoring because it is a critical element in fostering continued interest in STEM - particularly in underrepresented populations. HERL IGERT fellows embraced the opportunity to work with new generations of researchers through our NSF-sponsored Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program, as well as other similar programs, including the veteran-centric Experiential Learning for Veterans in Assistive Technology and Engineering (ELeVATE). The REU and ELeVATE programs ran parallel to one another and provided mentoring opportunities that assist two distinct groups. HERL IGERT fellows are proud of the role they play in developing future scientists, and the benefit of their mentoring will carry on for years. HERL IGERT fellows were responsible for advancing beneficial assistive technology that has a global impact on the lives of individuals/veterans with disabilities (I/VwD). Their research focused on ways to improve the level of inclusiveness for (I/VwD) and improve the level of safety for patients and caregivers. Further, their research has been found to offer tangible benefits for assisting an aging population, as well. Over the course of the program, HERL IGERT fellows assisted with PneuMobility, MEBot, and StrongArm - just to name a few.
