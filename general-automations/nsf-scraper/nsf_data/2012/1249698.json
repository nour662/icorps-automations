The workshop will bring together US and international researchers with interests in plant systems biology to discuss, highlight limitations, and focus on critical questions associated with feasibility and necessary technological and experimental advances for large-scale design of plant systems. The main purpose for the workshop is to: 1) Explore and identify areas of complementary interests, needs, and opportunities associated with the growing discipline of Plant Systems Biology, 2) Identify the primary research grand challenges and explore potential limits of the field from both the biological, computational, and engineering perspectives and, 3)  Formulate funding strategies for future collaborations.  A workshop report will be written and all data and related information generated from the workshop will be made available to the research community through an NCSU hosted website that will be created specifically for the workshop.  The amount of support for this proposal is: $48,516.\r\n\r\n\r\nGarie A. Fordyce, MS.c\r\nProgram Manager, EFRI \r\nDirectorate for Engineering \r\nNational Science Foundation",
