 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to defray expenses of US participants attending the International Workshop in Operator Theory and Applications (IWOTA), to be held at the University of South Wales, in Sydney, Australia, during July 16-20, 2012.  This project will fund participation of approximately twelve junior operator theorists from the United States who do not have support from other sources. Priority for funding will go to women and members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nFor the past 30 years, IWOTA has brought together mathematicians working in a variety of fields that share operator theory as a common theme. This will be twentieth meeting of IWOTA and the first time it will be held in Australia. The main themes of this workshop will be operator algebras, control theory, and harmonic analysis of differential operators.  Due to the diversity of topics covered in IWOTA, the speakers are encouraged to give talks accessible to a general audience of analysts. This makes the meeting particularly useful for graduate students, postdocs, and junior mathematicians; the meeting also creates the perfect atmosphere for stimulating collaborations. The list of invited speakers will include world experts in operator theory and its applications; the list of participants will include junior researchers and postdocs from the United States, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. The program will provide ample time for contributed talks and informal discussions. The award provides a very good opportunity for young mathematicians with research interests in the area of operator theory, broadly defined, to be exposed to the latest developments in several related fields, to interact with researchers from other countries, and to possibly initiate future collaborations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHilbert space operators are infinite-dimensional generalizations of matrices.  The generalization of a vector is often a function, and as a result operators are frequently modeled as multiplications on spaces of functions.  Operator Theory is the area of mathematics devoted to the study of Hilbert space operators.  Part of the study involves finding suitable models for operators, or for commuting families of them.  Once such models are obtained, many basic structural questions become natural.  There are deep inter-connections among operator theory, mathematical physics and engineering; additional links exist with statistics, spectral analysis, geophysics, image recognition and economics, to name a few related scientific areas of knowledge.\n\nThe International Workshop in Operator Theory and its Applications (IWOTA) is the largest mathematics conference devoted entirely to operator theory and its many applications (within mathematics, and also to other related disciplines, including physics and engineering).  Allowing junior mathematicians to take part in this annual conference is of the utmost importance in terms of exposing young investigators to cutting-edge developments, and of finding ways for them to interact professionally with the leading experts in the various subareas.\n\nThe main goal of the project was to award travel funds to junior mathematicians from the United States, so that they could participate in IWOTA 2012 (Sydney, Australia) and IWOTA 2013 (Bangalore, India).  The awards allowed thirteen mathematicians to attend IWOTA, to become more acquainted with the tools and techniques prevalent in operator theory and related areas, and to stay current with research trends.  Junior mathematicians were able to (i) participate in what is currently the largest operator theory in the world, (ii) interact with some of the top operator theorists, and (iii) present their research in an international forum.\n\nThe award have impacted in positive ways the professional development of these mathematicians.  All awardees have indicated that their participation in IWOTA has led to fruitful interactions, and to the publication of articles related to the topics of the two meetings.  All awardees have reported learning new tools, techniques and methods from their participation in IWOTA.  For them, the overall experience was extremely successful.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Raul E Curto"
