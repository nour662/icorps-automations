 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops models for information assurance education and outreach that can be disseminated to other institutions. The primary focus areas of this project are a high school outreach program, a multidisciplinary information assurance curriculum, and a community lecture series. \r\n\r\nThe high school outreach program is a four-week summer program for high school students and high school teachers in two aspects of information assurance - introduction to cryptography and explorations in network security and vulnerability analysis. The purpose of the outreach program is to introduce self-exploratory projects to students who have never participated in a research project and to encourage participating teachers to disseminate the ideas back to their classrooms during the school year. This program will help cultivate interest in information assurance.\r\n\r\nThe proposed multidisciplinary information assurance curriculum incorporates computer science, mathematics, political science, criminal justice, and other related fields to build a strong program that addresses both the technical and social aspects of information assurance.  Developed in consultation with faculty of the respective departments and with members of the law enforcement and intelligence communities, the intent of the curriculum is to create well-rounded graduates with a broad base of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe community lecture series addresses the lack of information assurance education channels in the region. The annual free community course provides in-depth exposure to information assurance topics, with culminating lectures featuring regional and national speakers. The proposed activity is a model for community engagement and education which will raise community awareness of information assurance issues.",
