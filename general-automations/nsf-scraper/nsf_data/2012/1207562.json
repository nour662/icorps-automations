This two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator, which supports quantized helical edge modes, is created by band-gap engineering using molecular beam epitaxy and electrostatic gates. The project will continue to explore interesting physics at the messoscopic length scale, with the focus on the helical edge modes and their interface with superconductors, where proximity effect and Andreev reflection will be systematically studied. The project will support the education of two Ph. D students, where a combination of advanced trainings in semiconductor materials, nanotechnology, and ultralow temperature measurements will be received. Understanding of materials science of this class of material and their topological properties is directly relevant to spintronics and quantum information technology. \r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\nElectrical insulators commonly refer to the materials that prevent the flow of electricity.

However, recent research demonstrates a type of topological insulators with novel properties. Although electricity cannot flow through them, it can flow around their narrow outer edges. The material, called a \"quantum spin Hall topological insulator\", acts as an electronic superhighway. It is one of the building blocks needed to create future electronics and computers. In this project we have carried out experiments on the newly discovered topological insulators made of semiconductors indium arsenide and gallium antimonide, addressing important issues relate to materials science and quantum physics. This is accomplished using the most advanced tools of nanotechnology and ultralow temperature measurements. \n\nThe quantum spin Hall insulator is here realized in InAs/GaSb quantum wells where electron-hole bilayer naturally occurs due to the unique broken-gap band alignment of InAs and GaSb.  In particular, the conduction band of InAs is lower than the valence band of GaSb, which results in charge transfer between the two layers, and emergence of coexisting 2D sheets of electrons and holes, as shown in Figure 1a and 1b. The Fermi energies of the electron and hole subbands can be adjusted by changing the thickness of InAs and GaSb layers, resulting in topologically trivial and non-trivial energy spectra shown in Figure 1c for narrower wells and wider wells, respectively. \n\nIn the topologically non-trivial regime, electron-hole subbands cross in the momentum space and due to the quantum tunneling between the wells, electron and hole states hybridize, opening an inverted energy gap. It has been proposed that at the edge of the system, this inverted gap must close before the normal gap such as in nearby native oxides or vacuum can open, creating a linearly dispersing helical edge spectrum. The term \"helical\" refers to the property that the edge states appear as a pair, with one branch moving to the left with spin up, and the other moving to the right with spin down. This spin-momentum locking property provides a topological protection such that the motion of electrons in the superhighway would be free of back scatterings, a cause for energy dissipation. Further research on this material will help to find way to transmit quantum information by spins and with little dissipation of energy as compared to the today's computer technology. \n\nIn this project such properties are measured by using low temperature quantum transport technique. Devices made from InAs/GaSb quantum spin Hall insulator show almost perfectly quantized conductance (Figure 2), as expected for helical edge channels. Another interesting prospect of the project is to engineer devices that can support so called Majorana bound states, by combining the helical edge states and superconductors. These novel excitations of the system can be exploited for topological quantum computing.  As an intial experiment we have demonstrated a prototype of such devices that show Andreev reflection in the interface between the helical edges and a superconductor (Figure 3). \n\nIntellectual Merit \n\nThe research work that has been accomplished is intellectually original, and represents a fundamental discovery concerning the topological insulators. The project has explored interesting effect and new physics, in particular the Majorana bound states in hybrid topological insulator-superconductor nanodevices. The experimental research work addresses the fundamental phenomenon and its physics in a very clean model system. From our experience with the 2D electron system, what being learned from it can impact many branches of physics. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe project has supported the education of two Ph. D students in semiconductor materials and technology, as well as fundamental physics.\n\nThe InAs/GaSb quantum wells being utilized in this project is a common material system for infrared detectors and imaging arrays. While Rice group designed the structures, material scientists in Teledyne Scientific &amp; Imaging have grown topological insulators for this project.
