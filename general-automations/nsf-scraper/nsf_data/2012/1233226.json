 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal addresses a fundamental aim of the ocean drilling program, namely to help characterize one of the largest and least studied ecosystems on Earth, the deep biosphere of the igneous crust buried below the ocean floor. The principal scientific objective of IODP expedition 336 is, in particular, to investigate the microbial population in basaltic crust from the North Pond area near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The study samples are weathered and porous basalts taken from beneath ~100 m of sediment in the North Pond area. The study proposes to determine both the diversity of the microbe population (using DNA) and its metabolic activity (using RNA).  The PI?s will investigate the relationship between microbes in the basement and those in the water column and determine which metabolic pathways are used by the deep basement microbes. The study will also provide baseline data for the long-term biological observatories installed in the sub-seafloor basement during expedition 336. \r\nUnderstanding deep biosphere life is a major thrust of the new IODP science plan and has implications for understanding the limits of life. The NSF-funded C-DEBI (Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations) program and Deep Earth Academy promote K-12 education and communicate the results of deep biosphere studies to broad technical and popular audience. An undergraduate student will be involved in the research.",

Rocks below the seafloor make up the largest potential habitat for life on Earth, yet we know very little about what life in this environment is like. This project specifically focused on rocks that were collected during an international scientific ocean drilling expedition to the western side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 336), where rocks are made of basalt and exposed to cool fluids that circulate through the seafloor, but other samples-of-opportunity from other deep-sea environments were also included for comparison. Results of this project documented, for the first time, the potential for microbes in this environment to respire (\"breathe\") oxygen, and set a boundary on what the rates of oxygen consumption in this environment might be. This value is important because it helps us to understand how microbes might be involved in \"weathering\" the rocks below the seafloor. We also documented, for the first time, the potential rates at which microbes growing on basalts can convert carbon dioxide into organic matter through chemolithoautotrophic processes (which is similar to photosynthesis, but powered by chemical energy instead of sunlight). This value is important because it provides a baseline for understanding the size of the base of the food web in the subsurface, just as photosynthesis does at the surface of the Earth. Through this project we also contributed to the recent description of the proteins used by iron-oxidizing bacteria to gain energy from growing on iron and oxygen under neutral pH conditions (essentially, growing by creating rust), which has eluded scientists for several decades. Through this project, we also contributed to a growing body of knowledge about the diversity of microbial life below the seafloor, and how this develops as bottom seawater circulates through the ocean crust. We've also developed new methods for capturing cells from these subsurface samples, to enable better analysis by future researchers. Ultimately, the results of this project provide a clearer picture of the types of microbes living below the seafloor and how much energy and food they have available to grow, and these results can inform the search for life elsewhere in the Universe that may be supported by growing on rocks.
