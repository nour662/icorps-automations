 "awd_abstract_narration": "Each summer, 12 undergraduate students will participate in an 8 week research program in the Cornell University Mathematics Department directed by 3 faculty members (the Principle Investigator, R. Strichartz, and 2 other chosen from among current and former department members) and assisted by graduate students and postdocs.  The students will work on research projects that are within their grasp, and which present real opportunities for new discoveries that will be of value to the mathematical community.  It is expected that some, but not all, of the research will lead to published papers.  Two types of projects will be emphasized:  1) computer related research with students writing programs, or using existing software; 2) problems in other areas that do not require a great deal of background knowledge.  In addition, the students will gain experience in communicating mathematics by presenting talks to each other and to the public. Additional information can be found at the project's website: http://www.math.cornell.edu/Undergraduate/REU/REU.htm\r\n\r\nThis project gives students the opportunity to contribute to research projects of interest to the mathematical community.  It is expected that the research will continue to have a significant impact in the area of analysis on fractals.  The faculty mentors are leaders in their fields. Student participants will get a true feeling for what mathematical research is like at a major research university, as they will be part of collaborative research groups including senior faculty, postdocs, and graduate students.  This will help recruit talented students to enter graduate school in the mathematical sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            The purpose of the program was to introduce undergraduates to serious  mathematical research under the supervision of a faculty mentor assisted by a graduate student.  Research problems were carefully chosen to be within the grasp of undergraduate students, yet also to be of interest to the mathematical research community.  Successful projects typically led to joint papers that have been submitted to respectable mathematics journals.  Because of the challenging nature of the problems, not all projects were successful, and those that were involved long term commitments of time by the students in the process of writing papers.  Many of the students also presented talks on their research at mathematical conferences.  Thus the students were exposed to the full spectrum of activities of a research mathematician, with all its joys and frustrations.\n\n             Over a period of three summers (2012 - 2014) there were 36 undergraduate student participants.  Of these, 24 were male and 12 were female, one was from Cornell and 35 from other schools, and three were underrepresented minorities.  Each summer there were 3 faculty mentors leading research groups.  The research ranged over many areas of mathematics:  analysis, algebra, geometry, data analysis, and differential geometry.  During all three summers the P.I. led research projects on analysis on fractals, an emerging area of interest to both mathematicians and physicists that attempts to create a theory of \"differential equations\" on the fractal spaces where the usual theory of calculus does not apply.   It is notable that the contributions of REU students over a period of 19 years has had a substantial impact on the development of this area.  During two of the summers, Xiaodong Cao directed research projects on nonlinear heat equations related to problems in flows in differential geometry.  The other projects offered for one summer:\n\n1.)  Packings and tilings in geometry, directed by Robert Connelly.\n\n2.)  Generating sets for finite groups, directed by Keith Dennis.\n\n3.)  High dimensional data analysis, directed by Mathew Hirn.\n\n4.)  Graphs, chip firing games and algebraic geometry, directed by Farbod Shokrieh.\n\n             At this time the research has yielded six papers that have been published or accepted for publication, two papers submitted for publication, and ten papers in preparation.\n\n            Many of the students are now in graduate school or are applying to graduate school in the mathematical sciences, computer science, or physics.  Several have been awarded NSF graduate fellowships.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/18/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert S Strichartz"
