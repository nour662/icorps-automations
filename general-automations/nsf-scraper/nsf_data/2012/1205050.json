 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to regional workforce needs, Hagerstown Community College is creating a biotechnology microscopy training center for education on the use of bright field, phase contrast, and fluorescence microscopy with digital imaging capabilities, in collaboration with local biotechnology industries, government laboratories and higher education partners. Two biotechnology courses are being created to strengthen the college's biotechnology program and existing biology courses are being updated with new protocols, developing options for entry into biotechnology employment, including internships. Broader impacts include educational outreach through mobile microscopy training for elementary, middle, and high school students, as well as professional development opportunities for area K-12 teachers, including summer workshops and in-service day activities.",
