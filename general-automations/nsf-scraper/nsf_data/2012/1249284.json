 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), a long term partner in the UT System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP), proposes to sponsor a cohort of 12 talented, underrepresented minority (URM) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) fellows during their first two years of doctoral training in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines.  The overall goal of this project is to advance the national and university goal of increasing the number of URM students who enter and successfully complete doctoral training in STEM fields and develop into leaders and role models in academic, government or industry sectors.  The primary goal of the current proposal is to develop a sustainable and training environment that provides comprehensive support for new URM students as they transition into graduate education and begin to develop as research professionals.  This will be accomplished through selective recruitment of prospective fellows to the exceptional training environment of UTSA, and implementation of a support and training program developed by melding of successful strategies developed at UTEP and UTSA, within the foundations of existing social-science and training literature.  A secondary goal is to promote replication of this program or its components in other emerging research institutions with similar URM populations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe UT System LSAMP - UTSA Cohort Bridge to the Doctorate Program was awarded in Fall 2012 and ran for two years.  The purpose of this program was to support PhD students from underrepresented (UR) groups (women or underrepresented minority) in the early years of their training, or support Master's students during their final years of training, leading up to their applying for the doctorate.  This type of support is critical.  Several federal scientific agencies have identified that the U.S. requires a large population of future scientists to sustain future economic growth.  In addition, social science studies have revealed that diversity in a group increases the number of creative solutions that are generated by the group.  Providing support, additional training, and encouragement for UR students while they while they pursue graduate degrees promotes their retention and success. \n\nThe UTSA LSAMP-BD program featured a cohort of twelve, and served thirteen students due to one withdrawel.  Three entered the program as master's students and ten as early stage doctoral trainees.  We provided a variety of stage-specific professional development sessions, faculty and peer mentoring, and outreach sessions to high school and undergraduates.  We also provided critical funding so that the students could a scientific confrerence. \n\nTwo of three students transitioned from master's work to a doctoral program (one at the Mayo Clinic and one at UTSA; sadly, the UTSA trainee was forced to withdraw on a medical leave of absense). The remaining Master's student had a major familiy change change that caused her to postpone application to MD/PhD programs, but she still plans to do so.  Of the ten early-stage PhD students who entered the program, eight continue their training, one has graduated, and the remaining had health issues that caused him to withdraw from the program.  The PDs assisted the student withdrew to obtain a part time teaching position for the student and hopes that someday, he will be back in a position to return to his studies.  One of the PhD students' mentors was cross appointed at UT Austin, so the student transferred to their PhD program in Petroleum Engineering, continuing the project that he began at UTSA.  The overall retention of all trainees was much higher than the national average for doctoral trainees, and even those who did withdraw due to illness, did so in close collaboration with the program PIs and exited in a way that leaves the door open for eventual return. \n\nThe LSAMP-BD program also insured that when two years of support was completed for the students, they were funded either by their mentor or by other training programs at UTSA.  Significantly, four of the trainees entered the UTSA NIGMS-funded RISE program, which provides continued stipend, professional, and mentoring support for the trainees.\n\nThe UTSA LSAMP-BD trainees are on track to have a substantial impact on the U.S. and other underrepresented students when they finish their schooling.  All but two of the trainees is Hispanic, and the remaining two are women, increasing the number of UR students pursuing a doctoral degree.  The single graduate is presently impacting national security be performing Postdoctoral work at Los Alamos National Laboratories.  One Master's trainee is continuing stem cell research at Johns Hopkins University.  The PhD students who continue their degrees are spread among critical fields such as Neurobiology, Physics, Chemistry, Virology, Electrical Engineering, Petroleum, and Mechanical Engineering.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/04/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gail Taylor"
