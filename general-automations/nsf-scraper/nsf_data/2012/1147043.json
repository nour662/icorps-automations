 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals constantly face challenges in their environment, which in part lead to dynamic and complex patterns of locomotion as well as innovations that allow animals to move more effectively in their natural habitat. One notable and extremely interesting innovation is the complex adhesive system of many geckos. Geckos are remarkable in their ability to climb vertically and sometimes in an upside-down posture. This biological adhesive system has inspired the development of gecko-like robots, adhesives, and even gloves.  Although the microstructure and dynamics of the adhesive system have recently been examined, little is known about how and when this system is used and what impact it has on the mechanics and neuromuscular control of locomotion. In addition, little is known about how geckos move in their natural habitat and how the diversity in toe morphology (bearing the adhesive system) relates to ecology and biomechanics. This project is focused on illuminating the functional consequences of morphological and ecological disparity in geckos, and, more generally, will assess the evolution of function across disparate groups of geckos. The researchers will integrate approaches and knowledge from biomechanics, ecology, comparative methods, and physiology to examine locomotion in geckos. Both fieldwork in Africa and laboratory experiments involving sophisticated techniques and equipment such as force plates, electromyography, high-speed video cameras, and micro imaging will be employed. \r\n\r\nIn addition to propelling the understanding of gecko locomotion, utilizing an integrative approach that incorporates field and lab studies will greatly enhance the training of young scientists, including a postdoctoral researcher, graduate students in the United States and Africa, and undergraduates. Trainees will have opportunities to learn sophisticated laboratory techniques, as well as gain valuable field experience. The students and postdoctoral fellow will present their work at international scientific meetings and publish their work in tier one journals. They will ultimately gain the independence, experience, and skills necessary for a successful academic career. \r\n\r\nThe scientific impacts of this work will be wide-ranging and interdisciplinary. For example, it is likely that species occupying habitats with drastically different surface textures will also exhibit differences in macro and micro-morphology. By knowing what morphology best suits a given surface texture, engineering groups could design surface-specific adhesives that mimic the gecko adhesive system. In addition, understanding the neuromuscular control and mechanics during locomotion in an animal with an adhesive system will also provide insight into the control that is necessary for gecko-inspired robots.",

This is not surprising given the remarkable ability of geckos to cling to smooth surfaces, including those that are inverted. The amazing athletic abilities of geckos has inspired the generation of synthetic materials and robots, among other things. Prior to the start of this award, little was known about how geckos move in their natural habitat, and how ecology has influenced the evolution and diversity of gecko adhesive morphology and function. Our research has made significant advances and has propelled our understanding of gecko adhesion. We have published over 20 manuscripts and given presentations at numerous conferences and events in the United States, Canada, Namibia, Trinidad, Italy, and Germany. We have inspired the general public via outreach events throughout the community, collaborations in Namibia and other countries, and through numerous popular press articles highlighting our research. Below are summaries of five major discoveries stemming from this award: 1) We determined that the secondary loss of the adhesive system results in an elevated rate of morphological evolution in the limbs of geckos from Namibia. This highlights the constraints that are likely imposed by the adhesive system. 2) We determined that adhesive microtopography is impacted by habitat use. This result stemmed from a study of different populations of the Namib Day Gecko. 3) We found that geckos can significantly modify the orientation of their feet when moving uphill and downhill in their habitat. This provides them with the ability to adhere when moving on any type of incline. 4) We found that the origin of the adhesive system likely occurred in small steps, and very slight changes in morphology have dramatic impacts on the biomechanics of geckos. 5) We found that the gecko adhesive system reaches its functional limit in extreme situations, such as jumping out of the canopy of the rainforest and landing on leaves below. Therefore, the common assertion that geckos have an overbuilt adhesive system is not likely true, given that extreme situations may be the driving factor in the evolution of the elaborate system. Overall, this award has generated new insight that will influence wide-ranging fields such as material science, robotics, physiology, evolutionary biology, biomechanics, and ecology. This award has enabled the training of numerous undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, and has provided them with the opportunity to collaborate with the international scientific community and to gain international experience by visiting other countries.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/31/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Timothy&nbsp;E&nbsp;Higham</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
