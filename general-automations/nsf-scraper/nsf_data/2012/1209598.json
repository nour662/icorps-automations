The host scientist is Dr. Shingo Saito.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is the development of analytical methods using gold nana-particules to simplify the detection of microbes. The nano-particles interact with and differentiate between different microbial species and are then separated using electrically-driven separation methods.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
