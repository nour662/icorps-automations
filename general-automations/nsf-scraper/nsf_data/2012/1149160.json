 "awd_abstract_narration": "Remarkably little is known about the number and types of genetic mutations that control differences within and among species. This project takes advantage of the diversity among the 350+ breeds of domestic pigeon - many of which show spectacular diversity in color, feather, and skeletal traits - to identify the genes that control variation in this species. Experimental crosses between dissimilar pigeon breeds will be used to determine the number and chromosome location of genes controlling interesting traits. Additionally, the genomes of many different breeds will be surveyed to find the specific mutations that control variation. Importantly, many of the traits that vary among pigeon breeds also vary among wild species of birds and other animals; thus, new insights gleaned from pigeons will yield a better general understanding of animal diversity.\r\n\r\nThe pigeon is already an important model organism in biology and medicine, and this project will potentially expand other research programs by providing new tools for genetic analyses. The educational plan of this project will also have local, national, and global impacts. A centerpiece of this plan is a new computer-based virtual pigeon breeder game that will be installed on the Utah Genetic Science Learning Center's highly successful website. These and other new educational materials will be targeted at a diverse community and broad age range, promote critical thinking and self-directed learning, and key components of this plan will be accessible via the Internet to reach millions of people worldwide.",
