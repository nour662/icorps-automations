 "awd_abstract_narration": "ALGECOM (algebra-geometry-combinatorics) is a series of one-day conferences that have occurred biannually since Fall 2009. The first funded conference is scheduled for April 28, 2012 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The main goal is promotion of collaboration and regular interaction among midwest students and faculty. Non-local senior mathematicians will be invited, enhancing the intellectual content of the series. This will contribute towards building ALGECOM into a longstanding tradition in the midwest. Each session of ALGECOM consists of four talks. A relatively light schedule of talks emphasizes the desire for ample opportunity for informal interaction. Since its inception, ALGECOM has alternated between Purdue University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Indiana University Purdue University in Indianapolis. NSF funds will support rotation of ALGECOM to other midwest institutions. This will broaden the reach of the series.\r\n\r\nConference series of similar scientific content exist on either coast, e.g., the BADMATH day in the Bay Area, and the NSF funded Triangle lecture series in the Raleigh-Durham area. We believe that the success of these excellent series can be replicated in the midwest. We will continue to encourage the attendance of graduate students, recent graduates, and untenured faculty. There are ongoing efforts to recruit participants and speakers in a diverse manner. These efforts are enhanced by NSF support, since it will be possible to fund individuals from a geographically larger region.\r\n\r\nInformation about the conference series can be found at the conference website:\r\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/algecomday/",
