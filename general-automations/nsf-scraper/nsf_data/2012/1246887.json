 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to develop an analytical and algorithmic framework for addressing variational inequality (VI) problems under uncertainty. Variational inequality problems can accommodate an expansive range of problems, including optimization problems, Nash games and equilibrium problems.   Yet, there is limited understanding of how to incorporate uncertainty in such problems. The proposed research intends to fill this gap by considering two extensions: (1) stochastic variational inequality (SVI) problems, which generalize VIs by replacing the mapping with its expected-value counterpart; and (2) robust variational inequality (RVI) problems, where robust solutions to VIs are obtained by parameterizing uncertainty in the feasible solution set and the mapping. In the context of each problem, the proposed research will be aggregated around two thrusts: (i) analysis and (ii) computation. As part of (i), tractable integration-free characterization statements will be developed, including those pertaining to the existence, uniqueness and stability of the associated solutions. Additionally, extensions accommodating nonconvexity will also be investigated.  In the context of (ii), the proposed research will investigate the development of adaptive step-size stochastic approximation schemes implementable over possibly evolving networks, as well as globally convergent and scalable decomposition schemes.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will lead to new and enhanced tools for the design and operation of networked systems, complicated by uncertainty, nonlinearity, nonsmoothness and competition, as arising in transportation, telecommunications and energy sectors. More specifically, this research will lead to robust and reliable power markets, effected through ongoing interactions with the independent system operator in New England (ISO-NE). The project incorporates a comprehensive education plan aggregated around high-school discovery courses, undergraduate research projects and graduate-level seminars and will be accompanied by efforts toward increasing diversity through student advising and mentoring.\r\n",

The second thrust of this grant lay on developing novel techniques for computing solutions to a breadth of such problems. Traditional approaches for such problems often could not contend with the challenge posed by uncertainty and the presence of nonsmoothness (i.e. the presence of kinks in the objectives). By developing novel techniques that combine Monte-Carlo sampling with smoothing techniques, we overcome these challenges in providing formal mathematical guarantees to support the claim that the algorithms can indeed address such problems. Formal analysis of the schemes also allow for determining how fast a solution can be approached. Yet the behavior of such schemes may often be slower, a consequence of the noise that emerges from Monte-Carlo sampling. Yet, by increasing the level of sampling, the variance (or spread) of this noise can be diminished at a suitable rate and the schemes perform similar to those in the deterministic regime. Significant advances have been made in developing such variance-reduced schemes for a range of optimization and game-theoretic problems in uncertain regimes. A related question that has been addressed is the concern of misspecification. Such problems naturally occur in practice since problem parameters are often unavailable (machine efficiency, failure rates, etc.) but can be learnt by solving a suitable problem (namely a learning problem). In fact, both the optimization and the learning problems need to be resolve simultaneously to ensure exact solutions in the limit. Techniques were developed for a range of optimization and game-theoretic problems to cope with such challenges, particularly in uncertain and nonlinear settings. Notably, it was shown that the rate at which the solution is approached is not adversely affected by the impact of such misspecification.
