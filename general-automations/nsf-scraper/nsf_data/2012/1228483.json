 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antitrust law prohibits cartels and other anti-competitive practices in order to safeguard consumer interests and promote market efficiency and innovation.  Legal doctrines, theoretical models, and empirical analyses of antitrust traditionally assume \"closed\" economies, where the boundaries of the market and the nation state coincide.  Yet today, foreign firms often compete in U.S. markets, and exports are increasingly important for U.S. firms.  This project offers a new understanding of antitrust in open economies and gathers extensive new data on antitrust laws and enforcement to allow systematic analyses of the relationship between trade and antitrust.\r\nTwo decades ago, less than forty countries had antitrust laws.  Today, more than one hundred thirty countries do.  Strikingly, this rapid proliferation of antitrust laws has coincided with substantial liberalization of international trade, even though trade openness has conventionally been thought to reduce the need for antitrust by increasing market competition.  This raises the concern whether governments are enacting and enforcing antitrust laws with a protectionist bias against foreign producers.  Alternatively, trade openness may require more vigorous enforcement and lead to increased international enforcement cooperation, because open trade creates greater opportunities and incentives for international antitrust violations. \r\nThis project examines the trade-antitrust relationship theoretically, as well as empirically by collecting new data on antitrust laws and enforcement (at the industry level over several decades in the United States and in the aggregate for numerous other countries).  It thus provides a stronger theoretical and empirical foundation for the important policy debate over an international antitrust regime.  More broadly, it will improve our understanding of how law mediates the relationship between politics and economics, elucidate the effects of delegating authority to expert bodies in a crucial issue area, and advance our understanding of the political and policy consequences of economic globalization.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCompetition law seeks to enhance economic welfare and economic freedom by prohibiting cartels as well as generally institutions and behaviors that reduce or eliminate market competition, such as using a monopolistic position in the market to keep out competitors or colluding to fix prices, divide up market, or rig bids for contracts.  The public enforcement of such laws, however, is inherently political, because it entails the use of the power of the state to constrain or re-distribute market power.  Understanding the fundamentally political nature of competition policy underscores the need for the political analysis of antitrust law and enforcement, all the more so since the selective enforcement of competition laws, perversely, can actually protect market participants from competitors and may even create or exacerbate inefficiencies.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the research support by the NSF Law &amp; Social Sciences Program under grant # 1228483 set out to improve our understanding of how economic openness affects antitrust regulation by developing a new analytical framework based on a more nuanced understanding of the political context of antitrust law and its enforcement and by building multiple new datasets to allow systematic and comprehensive statistical analyses of the relationship between economic openness and antitrust law and practice.  In gathering this data and working toward a more nuanced understanding of competition law and policy in a global context, this project also has sought to contribute to a better understanding of the causes and consequences of the rapid global spread of competition law, which in 1990 was limited to some thirty countries but today is found \"on the books\" in more than 130 countries all over the globe.\n\nThis Project Outcomes Report summarizes key findings from the part of the project carried out by multiple teams of research assistants at Duke University under the leadership of Prof. Tim B&uuml;the (see http://www.competitionpolicy.net for further details).\n\nThe Duke University portion of the project has generated or contributed to the creation of several datasets, to be publicly released in the near future, which provide a detailed encoding of:\n\n- approximately 4,000 antitrust enforcement actions undertaken by the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division between 1958 and 2012;\n\n- approximately 350 antitrust enforcement actions undertaken by the Federal Trade Commission between 2000 and 2010;\n\n- the antitrust provisions (if any) in 100 trade agreements signed since 1945\n\n- some 170 international agreements devoted specifically to enforcement cooperation (and conflict avoidance) between antitrust regulatory agencies.\n\nPreliminary analyses of our new data in conjunction with other data yield many original insights, most notably:\n\n1) The diffusion of antitrust law around the globe is substantially driven by the pattern of institutionalized trade integration: Countries are significantly more likely to adopt competition laws when more of the countries with which they have signed trade agreements have such laws in place.\n\n2) International trade makes antitrust enforcement more likely.
