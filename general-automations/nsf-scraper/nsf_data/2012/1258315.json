 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops, integrates, and tests advanced video and networking technologies to support family caregivers in managing behavioral symptoms of individuals with dementia, a growing public health problem that adds to caregiver stress, increases morbidity and mortality, and accelerates nursing home placement. The project builds upon a recent University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) clinical pilot study that tested the application of video monitoring in the home to support family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease who exhibited disruptive behaviors. The proposed project focuses on expanding the in-home technological tools available to strengthen the linkage between patients and caregivers with their healthcare team via multi-camera full-motion/high definition video monitoring. The proposed work will exploit the capabilities of GENI, in general, and the KU GpENI and KanREN-GENI projects in particular to help meet the goals of the US Ignite program, and explore the benefits of flexible networking to exploit high-bandwidth access to support family caregivers. Additionally, Google's deployment this year of a 1 Gpbs fiber network throughout Kansas City provides the ideal environment for measuring the impact that ultra-high speed networking to the home will have on health care.  Captured video will be streamed and stored on secure cloud-based servers. Upon notification and authorization by caregivers, the videos can be made accessible for viewing by clinical experts from web-enabled devices for the purpose of providing feedback to the caregivers in the home. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe technology platform will be applicable to a broad range of both physical and behavioral illnesses/conditions and caregiver/parental situations with the subsequent result being: 1) improvement in care/treatment within home-based settings; 2) avoidance or reduction of nursing home placements, hospital admissions/readmissions or other institutionalizations; 3) improvement in the quality of life of caregivers; and 4) overall reduced costs for the health care system. Potential applications for this monitoring platform may also be extendable to care settings outside the home. The project will also catalyze multidisciplinary research and education between electrical engineering/computer science, medical informatics, nursing, and other health professions and support the training of graduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goals of the project undertaken by the University of Kansas Medical Center and the University of Kansas Information and Telecommunications Technology Center were to develop and test advanced video and networking technologies to support family caregivers in managing behavioral symptoms of individuals with dementia.   The platform that was developed for this project links caregivers with health care professionals using video monitoring, two-way video conferencing and advanced networking technologies, allowing for observational data to be interpreted by experts outside of the home with follow-on guidance provided back to caregivers within the home to support managing behavioral issues.\n\nThe application includes high-resolution, network-based cameras connected to a video management server (VMS) located either locally or in the cloud (both capabilities have been developed).  When a caregiver elects to capture video behavioral changes in a patient, they utilize a browser-based application accessible via a mobile or other Internet-connected device.   The VMS subsequently creates and stores a video clip of the event.  Upon notification and authorization by the caregiver, the video is accessible for viewing by clinical experts from web-enabled devices for the purpose of providing feedback to the caregiver. \n\nThe project involved three phases over a two year period:\n\n1)            Requirements analysis and technology evaluation\n\n2)            Infrastructure deployment, application development and subject recruitment\n\n3)            Application deployment, use and evaluation.\n\nThis research has provided insight into how patient/caregiver controlled video records can become an additional tool for health care professionals who traditionally interact with electronic health record systems controlled by the health care provider.  A better understanding has been developed on the scalability of patient monitoring and consultation within the home setting with additional consideration being given to the use of video communications by health care professionals working at home and in distributed teams.\n\nFurther, this project evaluated the applicability of GENI &ndash; Global Environment for Network Innovation/Software-Defined Networking to support the secure transmission and storage of personal health information.  This project also helped inform nursing and geriatrics regarding the use of emerging personal digital monitoring capabilities. \n\nThe application/platform that has been developed could be applicable to a broad range of both physical and behavioral illnesses/conditions and caregiver/parental situations with the subsequent results being:  1) improvement in care/treatment within home-based settings; 2) avoidance or reduction of nursing home placements, hospital admissions/readmissions or other institutionalizations; 3) improvement in the quality of life of caregivers; 4) overall reduced costs for the health care system; and 5) reduction in travel time and cost of provider time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Russ Waitman"
