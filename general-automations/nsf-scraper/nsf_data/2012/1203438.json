 "awd_abstract_narration": "For more than 60 years the question of how plants make the growth hormone auxin has been of major interest to plant biologists.  Several issues have created significant confusion including the fact that auxin production at the low levels required for signaling appears to be closely linked to that of several compounds produced in much greater quantities. Auxin is involved in many aspects of plant growth, from early embryo development, to plant stature and form, to root initiation, to fruit development and ripening and plant responses to light, gravity and stress.  Improving our understanding of auxin production and the mechanisms for regulation of auxin levels, therefore, has great potential for enhancing both our basic knowledge of these processes and our targeting of genetics for plant improvement.   \r\n\r\nResearchers are now poised to solve the steps for the first pathway for auxin production using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. Recent genetic evidence makes it appear that two enzymes, an aminotransferase and a flavin monooxygenase, originally assigned to separate pathways, may together be sufficient for auxin synthesis from tryptophan.  To fully define this pathway requires demonstration that the flavin monooxygenase can carry out the novel terminal reaction that has precedent only in enzymes from microbes. This project will test a working hypothesis that the most likely mechanism for the flavin monooxygenase involved in auxin production is a combination of two activities, the oxidative decarboxylation as shown by bacterial lactate monooxygenase and a catalytic cycle using NADPH similar to that of a bacterial phenylacetone monooxygenase.  To date, however, no biochemical analysis of the action of the plant flavin monooxygenase protein has been reported on the expected substrate nor is the reaction mechanism known.  It is the goal of this EAGER project to elucidate the biochemical reaction carried out by Arabidopsis YUC flavin-monooxygenase, to describe the reaction mechanism, and to determine if the reaction measured in vitro can be shown to occur in vivo.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis project will support two graduate students and involve the students in both research and scientific writing.  These laboratories also serve as a resource in plant metabolomics and to auxin researchers interested in analysis and measurement of hormones at low abundance levels and their metabolism in plants.  These laboratories also maintain and encourage ties with several primarily undergraduate institutions, and have been welcome hosts to visitors who require the resources they develop.",

Now with modern genetic, genomic and analytical methods the first pathway to the growth directing plant hormone, auxin (indole-3-acetic acid) has been defined, but methods to fully understand this biochemical reaction were not available.  To fully define this pathway requires demonstration that an enzyme, called a flavin monooxygenase, can carry out the novel terminal reaction that has precedent only in enzymes from microbes.  \n               We showed in this work that the enzyme for making auxin was similar in both corn (Zea mays) and the reference plant Arabidopsis.  However, we also demonstrated that the cloned versions of the Arabidopsis genes, when expressed in bacteria, yielded weak enzyme activity difficult to study in detail.  However, the enzyme isolated from the endosperm of corn kernels was very active and suitable for detailed characterization. Using the corn system we were able to show that uniquely this reaction required molecular oxygen from the air.  Because of this requirement, we developed methods that allow researchers to measure the contribution of this first pathway to the total production of auxin in plants.  This result should lead to the discovery of the complete set of reaction methods plants use to produce this important growth signal such that plant growth can be better understood, modified and improved.\nBroader Impacts:\nThis project supported the research of two graduate students and involved undergraduate students in both research and scientific writing.  The research laboratories where this project was conducted also serve as a resource in plant metabolomics and auxin researchers interested in analysis and measurement of low abundance compound levels and metabolism in plants.  These laboratories also maintain and encourage ties with several primarily undergraduate institutions, and were hosts to visitors who required such resources.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/12/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jerry D Cohen"
