This conference brought together energy researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry.  Topics spanned emergency energy technology broadly, including wind, solar, shale-gas, efficiency/conservation, storage, smart-grid, transportation, systems and devices, and sustainability.  Conference papers to be published were peer reviewed from full-text submissions.  Of 143 papers submitted, 85 were approved for conference publication.  EnergyTech2012 followed the inaugural EnergyTech in May 2011, and substantial growth was realized (125 presentations in 2012 vs 70 in 2011).  The conference\u00c6s popularity has grown substantially, and much interest has been expressed in holding it again next year.  Thus it was decided to organize the conference once again in Cleveland, OH in  2013 and 2014.     \nSpecific activities supported in whole or in part with NSF funding:\nOur NSF award was used exclusively to provide travel and registration support for domestic students attending IEEE EnergyTech2012, May 29-31, Cleveland, OH.  NSF travel funds were allocated to 16 student awardees from 13 States.  \nWith additional support from ARPA-E and from the Cleveland Foundation, we were able to assist 39 domestic graduate students attending the conference.  Further, 39 high-school students from local STEM programs were hosted for half-day attendance.\nIn all, 105 students attended this conference.  Most of the domestic graduate students attending were offered at least partial support.  Their attendance will help attract researchers and technologies to energy-related fields, helped to train the next generation of energy researchers, and helped to connect students with current researchers and industrial representative working in energy.\nAchievement of desired objectives:\nOur success in attracting interested students to this conference and helping make their attendance possible exceeded our ambitions.  We hope to expand further on this success in next year\u00c6s IEEE EnergyTech conference.\n \nAttendees:\nIEEE EnergyTech2012 had 235 registered attendees.  Among these, there were 105 students.  Twenty-four attendees came from overseas, and the remainder came from 25 U.S. States.   The program included 4 parallel tracks&mdash;one of which was designated an \"industry\" track with 28 presentations from industry.   Among the academic presentations, the strongest representation was from NASA Glenn Research Center (a sponsor) and from Case Western Reserve University (the host institution).\nSurvey results:\nOur response rate on surveys was relatively low (approximately 15%, or 36 respondents).  We will attempt to improve the response rate in 2013.  Of those responding to question 1&mdash;rate your overall experience at EnergyTech2012&mdash;33 out of 34 rated it excellent or good.  On question 2&mdash;do you expect to attend EnergyTech2013&mdash;30 out of 36 respondents (83%) said they expected to return again next year.  For question 3&mdash;would you recommend EnergyTech2013 to a colleague&mdash;36 out of 36 (100%) responded \"yes.\"  In rating favorite sessions, half of the top 6 sessions were from the industry track (which comprised only 25% of the total sessions), indicating that the industry track was highly valued by attendees.\nFuture plans:\nBased on the success of the inaugural EnergyTech conference in 2011, and the growth from 70 presentations to 125 presentations in 2012, we plan to continue to offer and grow this conference.  Dates have been set for both 2013 and 2014.\nConcrete outcomes:\nApproximately 80 full-text, peer-revie..."
