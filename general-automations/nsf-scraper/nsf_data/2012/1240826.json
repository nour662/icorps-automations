Also important is leaning how to present, in a cogent and understandable way, the results of one?s research. The requested\r\nsupport will help to accomplish these ends. At the conference, students will make important personal contacts and learn of employment opportunities. At a special student breakfast, the conference organizers will describe to the students optimal techniques for presenting scientific information and how the conference program is put together.",
