 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnership for Innovation project from the University of Oregon (Eugene) proposes to develop the capacity to accelerate the commercialization of inorganic nano-particle technologies. Inorganic nano-particles consist of an inorganic (metal or metal oxide) core 1 to 100 nm in diameter surrounded by a shell of molecular or polymeric coatings. The wide variety of the physical properties of the core materials and the selective binding capabilities of the ligands and coatings comprise a versatile tool kit with commercial applications across nearly every industrial sector.  However, commercialization of these nanomaterials has been limited by difficulties in translating the synthesis methods used during discovery research to reliable commercial scale production.  This project aims to address research problems at the frontiers of nano-science by developing improved materials measurement and characterization techniques that will enable nanoparticles to be produced and their properties optimized, advancing the state of the art in nanoscience, and thus accelerating the commercialization process itself.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project are related to economics, education, and diversity. The small companies that participate in the knowledge enhancement partners (KEP) group will develop production techniques that are reproducible, reliable, scalable, fast, efficient, robust, precise, and inexpensive. These improvements will enable large-scale economic opportunities in photovoltaics, solid-state lighting and display technologies. The project will enable the acceleration of the commercialization of nanoparticles in other sectors, including: energy storage, catalysis, information technology, cancer treatment, and environmental remediation. Students and faculty members who participate in this project will learn to conduct basic research in an explicitly technological and industrial context.  The KEP will encourage the participation of under-represented groups by offering summer research experiences to community college students.\r\n\r\nPartners at the inception of this project include lead academic institution,University of Oregon,(Department of Chemistry, Materials Science Institute, Center for Advanced Materials Characterization in Oregon (CAMCOR), and Lundquist College of Business); Small businesses: QD Vision, Lexington, Massachusetts; Voxtel, Beaverton, Oregon; Dune Sciences, Eugene, Oregon; and Hummingbird Scientific, Lacey, Washington; and a Federal agency: The National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland. Other partner organizations include: Academic (UO Lundquist Center for Entrepreneurship and Office of Technology Transfer); Private (Life Technologies); Public (NanoBusiness Commercialization Association, National Nanomanufacturing Network, Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnology Institute; Safer Nanomaterials and Nanomanufacturing Initiative; and the University-Industry Demonstration Partnership).",

To address the fundamental scientific challenges that inhibit innovation, this project brought together expertise from the university, four small business partners and additional private sector partners to advance innovation and accelerate the commercialization of inorganic nanoparticle technologies.\n\nThe research team addressed problems at the frontiers of nanoscience, guided by the technical issues confronting the partnership companies. In one focus area, the team developed improved materials measurement and characterization techniques that enable academic researchers and manufacturing engineers to elucidate the reactions by which nanoparticles can be produced and their properties optimized.  In a second focus area, the team advanced the state of the art in nanomaterial production to accelerate the commercialization process.\n\nMajor findings of our research include:\n\nNew, rapid nanoparticle characterization techniques.  Traditional methods of determining the size and structure of nanomaterials are slow, tedious and expensive.  The research team developed new methods of characterization based upon x-ray scattering that were faster, easier and less costly.  Several studies demonstrated how these new methods accelerate development of new nanomaterials with properties optimized for applications from microelectronics to biology.\nNew, continuous growth techniques for metal oxide nanocrystal synthesis.  Metal oxide nanocrystals have a myriad of uses in applications requiring magnetic materials, transparent conductors and active catalysts.  The research team discovered a new synthesis method that permits exquisite control over the placement of individual atoms within the nanocrystals while simultaneously controlling the size of the finished nanocrystal.  This unprecedented level of structural control provides an opportunity to manipulate the optical, magnetic and electronic properties to fuel new applications of these materials.\nFlow reactors for reliable production of precisely defined nanoparticles. A significant challenge in nanoparticle production is that the structure, and therefore the properties, of the nanoparticle can vary widely due to small changes in reaction conditions.  The research team developed a simple, yet powerful, flow reaction system that permits precise control of nanoparticle core size and over the composition of the surface coating.  Using the flow reactor, each batch of particles is the same and the size and composition can be predictably controlled during production.\n\n\nThe broader impacts of this project are related to economic development and education.
