 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research will define a new approach for retrieving useful analogies for innovation based on the relevant performance characteristics of critical functions. Analogy matching is made possible by the novel incorporation of Non Uniform Rational B-spline (NURBs) based metamodels that enable efficient representation of critical function performance. These metamodels are obtained from simulations, engineering models (such as bond graphs) and/or experimental data collections. This approach will enable multiple analogies to be presented to the designer with a quantified match quality metric related to the desired performance benefit to the design. The impact of this approach for inspiring novel designs will be measured through controlled experiments measuring the impact of the MetaAnalogy via Performance Specification (MAPS) technique at both the conceptual design phase and throughout the design process. Working prototypes from the experiments will allow for direct quantification of performance.\r\n\r\nEngineering innovation is critical to meet a vast array of challenges including the grand engineering challenges of the 21st century in the form of energy and environmental solutions. If successful, results of the research will provide a critical foundation for new approaches to analogy retrieval based on quantitative performance measures along with function for use in education and industry. Class modules applying MAPS to analogy-based innovation will be created. Workshops integrated with webinars on MAPS and design by analogy will be used to disseminate research results beyond the educational sector and to provide necessary educational tools to bring design by analogy and quantification via Metamodeling into the classroom.",
