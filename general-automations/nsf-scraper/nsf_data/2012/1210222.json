 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Alec Michael Kretchun of Portland State University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Landscape change and carbon sequestration in the forests of northeastern Asia under a changing climate,\" during the summer of 2012 at Kookmin University in Seoul, Korea. The host scientist is Dr. Dongwook Ko.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is that it addresses landscape and regional issues related to climate change, forest succession, and carbon dynamics and management using both empirical data collection and modeled forest change in Korea. Because of their unique history and composition, these forests are a source of valuable lessons on forest growth processes, successional dynamics, land use impact, and human-nature interactions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
