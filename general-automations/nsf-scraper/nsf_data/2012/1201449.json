The discovery of new catalytic processes and the improvement of existing ones have a major economic impact on our nation.  It is estimated that 80% of the products of modern society go through a catalytic process at some point in their manufacture.  Catalysis is also critically important for securing the nation?s energy supply.\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests support for the 2012 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Catalysis.  The conference, which will be held at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire, on June 24?29, 2012, will bring together leading researchers from around the world to discuss their latest, most exciting work in catalysis and future directions for the field.  The meeting sessions that will take place are:\r\n\r\n1)\tCatalysis: New Advances and Applications\r\n2)\tAdvances in Surface Science and Characterization\r\n3)\tAdvances in Theory and its Application to Catalysis\r\n4)\tPerspectives on Catalytic Mechanisms\r\n5)\tOrganometallic Catalytic Systems: Homogeneous to Heterogeneous\r\n6)\tClosing the Pressure Gap, Fundamentals to Application\r\n7)\tAdvances in Photocatalysis\r\n8)\tNew Frontiers in Catalysis in Energy Systems\r\n9)\tCatalysis: Impact and Future Directions.  \r\n  \r\nA special effort will be made to support early career scientists who otherwise would be unable to attend: junior faculty members, post-docs and graduate students, with special emphasis on promoting the participation of women and underrepresented groups.  Participation by early career catalytic researchers will add significant value to this conference and will foster communications among current and future leaders in a field that derives its vitality from the continuous interplay between academic and industrial research.  The setting of the conference helps keep participants on-site in order to maximize interactions, intellectual discourse and networking.",
