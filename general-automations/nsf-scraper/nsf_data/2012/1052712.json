The Raman spectrometer is primarily used by the high pressure research group at Princeton for rapid non-destructive mineralogical analysis of standards for pressure determination (e.g., ruby fluorescence) and is an essential component for high-pressure diamond anvil cell experiments to study the properties of deep Earth mineral phases.  Funding will support acquisition of a new laser, CCD detector, and spectrometer.  The upgraded Raman system will support faculty and student research beyond Geosciences at Princeton and student training will be facilitated through hands on experiential learning as part of analytical coursework.\r\n\r\n***",
