 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the City College of New York, which is part of the City University of New York.  This grant will provide research training for 36 early-stage students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013-2015.  The Department of Biology has a dynamic group of 22 research-active faculty members who will serve as research mentors.  Their research interests span the biological spectrum, ranging from molecular biology to population biology; some representative research projects include host-parasite interactions, modification of genes to modulate behavior, mechanisms underlying bacterial division, and molecular pathways in blood cell formation.  In addition, students will attend research seminars, where they will be exposed to the diversity of research projects being conducted in the department, and various workshops, where training in responsible conduct in research, scientific writing, and scientific communication will occur and where panels will inform students about different career opportunities in industry and academia.  Students will also take field trips to local industries, such as biotechnology companies, and research institutes, such as the American Museum of Natural History, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, with which the City College has a partnership agreement.  The program's multi-phase recruitment effort within City College and among City University community colleges will consist of traditional \"hard copy\" formats, digital-based advertising, and campus recruitments.  Students will be selected based on academic record, research performance, motivation, and potential for outstanding research in biology. Students will be tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/biology/REU or by contacting the PI (Dr. Chris Li at cli@ccny.cuny.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Jonathan Levitt at jlevitt@ccny.cuny.edu).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goals of the NSF REU site at the City College of New York (CCNY) were to involve students, particularly from under-represented and economically disadvantaged populations, in research and train them to articulate their research findings to a larger audience.  By involving urban, non-residential college students in research, their research laboratories were expected to provide a nurturing and stabilizing community, which was to help in the retention and graduation of the students.  We had a total of 39 students over the four summers in which we ran the program.  Of these students, 23 were recruited from CCNY and 16 from the community colleges within the City University of New York (CUNY) system.  The cohort was racially and economically diverse and in aggregate included: 51.2% under-represented minorities (not including Asians except Pacific Islanders), 48.7% female, &gt;48.7% Pell recipients (not all fellows responded in the first two cohorts), and 48.7% who were the first in their family to attend college.  By having a connection to CCNY, the expectation was that the CUNY community college students would transfer to a 4-year college, and, in particular, to CCNY.  Urban, non-residential public colleges have low retention and pass rates (for instance, the 6-year graduation rate at CCNY is 44%).  Overall, we found that the NSF REU program did what it was intended to do.  Despite our program focusing on more junior students (i.e., after their sophomore year), over 50% of the NSF REU fellows have already graduated with a BS or BA degree.  Eight of these fellows went to graduate school, seven to medical school.  Of the 16 community college students in our cohort, 14 transferred to a 4-year college and three have already graduated with a BS or BA degree.  With the exception of three fellows, the remaining fellows are on track to graduate in a timely manner.  Six fellows are already co-authors on peer-reviewed journal or workshop papers; fellows are on two additional papers that have been submitted.  In summary, the funding was essential to encouraging underserved populations to participate in scientific research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christine Li"
