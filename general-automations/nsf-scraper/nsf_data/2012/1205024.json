 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses theoretical physics at the interface of nuclear physics, particle physics, and astrophysics.  There are two major themes: i) exploring the role of neutrinos and their self interactions in core-collapse supernovae as well as in the Early Universe; ii) exploring the structure of nuclei at or far from the line of stability using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. \r\n\r\nResearch activity contributes to the national priorities in nuclear science such as neutrino physics and rare-isotope science.  Neutrinos play an essential role in physics and there is a fascinating interplay between neutrino properties and various astrophysical phenomena.  They are rather special particles with their seemingly very small masses and feeble interactions with ordinary matter.  Neutrinos make an exceptional probe for astronomical environments that are typically concealed from the standpoint of other observation techniques, such as optical and radio observation.  They also impact supernovae, the explosions that end the lives of highly massive stars. Understanding the structure of rare isotopes (short-lived nuclei not normally found on Earth) could lead to a better understanding of the physics of nuclei, origin of elements, and fundamental interactions, as well as applications for society.  The project will directly involve graduate students as part of their preparation as future scientific leaders.",
