 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over 70,000 students take organic chemistry each year in the USA with attrition rates approaching 50% at some institutions. The obstacles to success in organic chemistry are both the large amount of material that students are required to learn and more importantly the unfamiliar style of problem solving and assessment. The project has developed a method of instruction based on problem solving from fundamental principles (e.g., Lewis acid/base theory; retrosynthetic analysis). However, the present materials are passive (html and pdf files). Pilot studies show that although students think they are using these materials effectively, they are actually using ineffective methods.  Their illusion is consistent with studies of meta-cognitive and self-regulated learning. The project develops and tests software (called a meta-cognitive coach) that closely monitors students' problem solving so that it can offer unsolicited advice at just the right moments to motivate students to use specific, more effective learning strategies. For instance, the coach might convince a student to study a problem 2 or 3 times deeply, rather than 20 or 30 times shallowly. The project will help learning scientists know how to build effective meta-cognitive coaches for knowledge-rich domains.  The project will also yield an online practice system that may significantly improve organic chemistry students' learning, which may reduce attrition and ultimately increase the flow of a diversity of students through this critical scientific pipeline.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            Organic chemistry is a required course for many students, notably in pre-health tracks.  Organic chemistry is often described as a roadblock course for many students who wish to enter medical school and other health professions, particularly for minorities and underrepresented populations.  Work from this project has suggests that organic chemistry may also be a roadblock course for females.  This project is directed towards developing a learning system that not only aims to improve learning in this notoriously difficult subject, but also to \"level the playing field\" as much as possible, so that those students who are traditionally disadvantaged coming into organic chemistry can thrive.\n\n            We have developed a web-based online homework system that is uses a new method for learning organic chemistry based on sound teaching/learning theories. Students are encouraged to construct their own understanding of the material by working with new concepts in multiple contexts.  We have also developed the first comprehensive set of knowledge components for organic chemistry.  The homework system tracks student progress across each of these knowledge components using state-of-the-art probability calculations, and adapts to the individual student\u00c6s progress by suggesting the most useful problems on a student-by-student basis.\n\n The online homework system, called \"Organic chemistry Practice Environment\" (OPE), has been tested in classes of over 500 students per semester and over four semesters (fall 2012 - spring 2015).  Its 2282 organic chemistry problems cover the entire content of a standard two-semester organic chemistry course.  These problems are unique to OPE, and are based on the Lewis acid/base pedagogical approach to learning organic chemistry.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kurt Vanlehn"
