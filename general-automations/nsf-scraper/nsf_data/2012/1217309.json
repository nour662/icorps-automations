 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology provides a means of boosting network capacity without requiring additional spectrum by exploiting spatially multiplexing, interference suppression, and spatial diversity. It has received widespread attention over the past decade from both industry and academic researchers, now forming a key component of nearly all emerging wireless standards. Despite the huge promise and considerable attention, a rigorous algorithm-theoretic framework for maximizing network capacity in multihop wireless MIMO networks is missing in the state of the art. This project establishes both the computational hardness and approximation hardness of maximizing network capacity in multihop wireless MIMO networks, and develops practical approximation algorithms with provably good performance. A polyhedral approach is taken by the project to construct various polynomial approximate capacity subregions of multihop wireless MIMO networks. These approximate capacity subregions not only are the algorithmic foundation of maximizing network capacity in multihop wireless MIMO networks, but also serve as a basis for interesting future projects on cross-layer design and optimizations in multihop wireless MIMO networks. They are also of independent interest to the theoretical computer science community and communications community at large. This project provides scholarships to graduate students and offers research topics for strong dissertation works on multihop wireless networks. The outcome of this project will not only be disseminated to the professional researchers through journals and conference proceedings, but also be integrated into the lecture notes targeted for senior undergraduate students and graduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNetworking technology is vital, in virtually all aspects, to the functioning of today's society.  From banking to entertainment, from saying \"hello\" to staying healthy, the efficient transfer of data among computing and communicating sites is critical.  We can no longer imagine a world where we cannot remain in constant contact with those we care about and with the institutions and organizations that we depend on.  All this interaction, however, relies on the ability of our networks to support the sufficient throughput needed to sustain such connectivity.\n\nThe research domain of communication networks is vast and ever expanding.  No study can focus on the entire communications domain.  Limiting one\u00c6s scope is critical to achieving any meaningful result, and our focus is on network throughput.  Specifically, our attention aimed at increasing network capacity in wireless Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output (MIMO) networks.\n\nMIMO technology boosts network capacity without requiring additional spectrum.  Capacity boosting in MIMO based systems is achieved via the exploitation of spatial multiplexing, interference suppression, and spatial diversity.  MIMO based research has received widespread attention over the past decade from both industry and academic researchers and now forms a key component of nearly all emerging wireless standards.\n\nDespite the vast promise and considerable attention, a rigorous algorithmic framework for maximizing network capacity in multihop wireless MIMO networks eluded the state-of-the-art.  A major technical obstacle was (and still is) the complicated trade-off between spatial multiplexing and interference suppression with the limited number of antennas at each node.  In this research effort, we aimed at establishing a comprehensive algorithmic framework for maximizing network capacity in multihop wireless MIMO networks.  Furthermore, within this framework, we targeted and managed to develop novel techniques and tools that effectively capitalized on the benefits of both spatial multiplexing and interference suppression.\n\nResearch community attention often focused on the characterization of computational hardness and the evaluation of achievable approximation bounds for multiflow problems in wireless networks.  However, the development of practical approaches in terms of both running time and memory requirement has, for the most part, been ignored.  Our interests differed and resulted in a practical approach.  Via a sequence of shortest paths and independent sets computations, we developed practical approximation algorithms that offer a tradeoff between accuracy (in terms the approximation bounds) and efficiency (in terms of execution time).\n\nFinally, as tomorrow\u00c6s technology depends on today\u00c6s research results and on the training of tomorrow\u00c6s technologists, in coordination with the lead institution, several doctoral students advanced their studies as part of this effort; some of them graduated.   Publications describing our findings are available freely on the web and in the corresponding professional society digital libraries.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/24/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ophir Frieder"
