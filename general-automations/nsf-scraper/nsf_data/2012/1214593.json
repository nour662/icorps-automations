 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop inexpensive carbon\r\ndioxide sensors for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) controls. The sensors will use\r\nDioxide Materials' patent pending catalyst mixtures, to create a series of CO2 sensors using a novel\r\ndesign. We expect to create sensors that are an order of magnitude less expensive than the CO2 sensors\r\nused for HVAC systems today and yet show comparable performance. The proposed Phase I work will\r\ninclude developing solid electrolytes for the device, testing performance against customer supplied\r\nspecs, and checking for corrosion.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop a sensors that will enable affordable\r\ncontrol systems that result in significant reductions in utility costs for homes and businesses. Most HVAC\r\nsystems are inefficient. They run full blast when buildings are nearly empty, and over ventilate because\r\nthe air quality in a building is unknown. Several, vendors have developed control systems that use CO2\r\nsensors to assess the air quality and adjust the HVAC systems accordingly. Energy savings of up to\r\n$0.31/ft2/yr (i.e. $465/yr for a 1500 ft2 house) have been demonstrated, but the systems have not been\r\nwidely deployed because the needed CO2 sensors are too expensive and cannot be attached to a\r\nstandard thermostat. If the project is successful through Phase II, Dioxide Materials' new sensors will\r\nmake advanced HVAC control systems affordable. Utility bills will go down. Further, utilities will not\r\nneed to generate as much electricity, so greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of the Phase I effort was to demonstrate create low cost CO2 sensors for smart heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems that can reduce utility bills by as much as 20%, improve worker productivity as much as 10%, and lower the carbon footprint of buildings by a comparable amount.  By way of background, HVAC systems use about 40% of the electricity in the US and 42% of the natural gas.   Surprisingly, as much as 30% of that energy use is largely wasted through avoidable inefficient HVAC utilization.   Many HVAC systems run at maximum when homes and businesses are partially or mostly unoccupied which wastes energy and leads to higher utility bills.\n\nEnergystar.gov estimates that the energy use and carbon footprint of buildings could be reduced by 10-30% by using what is called \"demand control ventilation\" i.e. measuring the air quality, via a carbon dioxide sensor, and adjusting the ventilation rates accordingly.    Savings of $0.31/ft2/yr have already been demonstrated and worker productivity increases 5-10%, due to healthier air have been claimed.  If widely adopted, that would produce significant reductions in energy use and HVAC operational costs an simultaneously improve worker productivity.    \n\nUnfortunately, before we started this project, the only CO2 sensors that could meet the needs of HVAC systems were too expensive and used too much power to be widely deployed for building retrofits and in peoples homes.  The object of the proposed work was to demonstrate new sensors that could meet the needs or HVAC systems and cost much less.\n\n \n\nThe Phase I worked showed that the sensors had promise.   The new sensors have the same sensitivity as the sensors now used in HVAC systems, but cost an order of magnitude less to produce and use a factor of 100-1000 less power.  There is still more work to do, but the devices look promising.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/05/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zheng Ni"
