 "awd_abstract_narration": "Primates are distinguished from most other mammals by a trend toward midfacial reduction, most notably seen in the reduced 'snout' of monkeys, apes, and humans. This study uses a novel developmental approach to test whether midfacial reduction of the skull in primates is a byproduct of growth of neighboring structures (e.g., eyes and teeth). For example, does selection for a precocious visual nervous system fundamentally affect midfacial patterns of growth? Do proportionately large deciduous maxillary teeth and their successors have transient or lasting effects on development of paranasal spaces of the maxilla? To answer these questions, cadaveric samples from over seventy specimens (including 20 species of primates) will be studied. Specimens of different postnatal ages will be studied using an innovative combination of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and microscopic study of decalcified samples.  The result is a novel approach for mapping regions of bone deposition and resorption in three dimensions. The project will create unique three-dimensional 'growth maps' of primate skulls in relation to functional units of the head (eyes, nasal airways, teeth). Three-dimensional skull form and growth maps will then be compared among primates that differ in the extent to which the eyes are convergent (forward-facing). Indirect influences on neural and dental development, such as gestation length and diet, will also be used as variables.\r\n\r\nThe broader implications of the study include a web-based atlas and digital archive of histological and CT images from the specimens. The interactive online atlas will be developed as a resource for anatomists, who will benefit from animal models for aspects of human development, and primatologists, who will benefit from the resource on development of primates. In addition, animations which highlight the importance of growth mechanisms for evolutionary adaptation will be created and made available to advanced K-12 students and their teachers as online educational tools.",

We included monkeys as models to understand our own relatively flat human faces, because many monkeys share this facial reduction, and are also small enough to study using histology. We studied a sample of over 100 specimens of subadult nonhuman primates that died of natural causes. Using computed tomography (CT) imaging methods, we established early growth patterns of bones that support the eyes and teeth, as well as early patterns of tooth mineralization (Fig. 1-2). In a subset of these animals, we used histology to examine the activity of cells that produce and reshape bone in order to understand the influence of eyes and teeth on growing bones, as well as the early signs of tooth mineralization that go undetected using CT.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> In general, we found monkeys have more precocious growth of eyes than lemurs and lorises, consistent with the expectation of greater reliance on the visual system in primates more closely related to humans.&nbsp; In species with larger eyes this was related to bone resorption in the orbit&nbsp;(Fig. 1), encroaching on space within the nasal cavity.&nbsp; To some extent this also occurs in larger-eyed lemurs and lorises; however, the deepest parts of the orbits in these animals actually grow apart (Fig. 2), most likely due to growth of the forebrain, parts of which intervene between the orbits in lemurs and lorises. We also found that precocious development of the first permanent molar is a characteristic of nearly all living primates, but major differences exist between monkeys and lemurs and lorises. Specifically, monkeys delay development of permanent teeth considerably compared to most lemurs and lorises. Lemurs that delay development of replacement teeth possess poorly mineralized tooth germs that are relatively large. Results from this project suggest that the enlarged eyes that typify all living primates may cause some degree of nasal reduction, at least in the volume of paranasal spaces. Greater dental volume during development may be the biggest factor influencing the greater snout length in most lorises and lemurs compared to monkeys (Fig. 3). These findings support the hypothesis that selection for an enhanced visual system has influenced midfacial proportions, primarily by encroaching on interorbital space, and producing a relatively diminutive midfacial skeleton. However, other growing elements in the head, such as teeth and parts of the brain, also strongly influence bone growth patterns as documented by 3D \"maps\" of bone resorption and deposition. In the neonate, the selection for sensory and dietary specialization may explain growth patterns, and thus adult cranial form.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> Our project also resulted in a novel technique of annotating CT volumes of whole or partial skulls with information about cellular function obtained from histology.&nbsp; Funding for the collaborative project contributed to research infrastructure and provided resources to support the training of 18 graduate students and 6 undergraduate students at Slippery Rock University (BCS-1231350), Johns Hopkins University (BCS-1231717), and University of Florida (BCS-1728263).&nbsp; Products included 10 published papers and book chapters, 30 presentations at national meetings, distribution of CT image data to the research community to support future research, and creation of a freely-available online resource, the <em>Atlas of Primate Skeletal Growth.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top: .25in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-outline-level: 3; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/31/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Timothy&nbsp;D&nbsp;Smith</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1231350/1231350_10208943_1540992287127_interorbital-Saimiri-vs2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1231350/1231350_10208943_1540992287127_interorbital-Saimiri-vs2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1231350/1231350_10208943_1540992287127_interorbital-Saimiri-vs2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cross-section through the orbit of a newborn monkey shown in an aligned histological section (left) and CT slice (middle).
