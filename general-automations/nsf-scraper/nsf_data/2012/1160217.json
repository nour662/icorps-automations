 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supported Au catalysts are now well established as extremely active catalysts for low temperature CO oxidation and a number of other reactions. Further advances in Au catalysis will require more detailed understanding of the important factors that govern its high catalytic activity and developing methods for tuning reaction selectivity.  Many of these catalysts are comprised of Au nanoparticles dispersed on high surface area oxide carriers.  The nanoparticles typically consist of tens to a few hundred atoms to maximize the number of surface atoms that are accessible to the reacting molecules.  Because these particles are so small, they can be influenced by the underlying support.  Further, although the support may influence the electronic properties of the nanoparticle, it is not clear how these changes affect the electronic structure of the transition state(s) for the key step(s) in the catalytic cycle. This project primarily involves developing new methods and approaches for characterizing how the underlying support changes the electronic properties of gold nanoparticles and determining how these electronic changes affect catalytic behavior. \r\n\r\nProfessors Bert Chandler and Christopher Pursell at Trinity University, San Antonio, TX are teaming with Professor Robert Rioux at Pennsylvania State University to apply a known tool to aid in developing more understanding of this problem. Hammett studies have long been employed to help understand reaction mechanisms, and to evaluate charge build-up in the rate determining step. The Hammett methodology has been applied to several Au catalyzed reactions, and studies of benzyl alcohol oxidation by Au on different supports have shown significant differences, suggesting that the degree of charge building up on the organic fragment may be substantially influenced by the underlying support. These studies will be correlated with CO adsorption studies and X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies to characterize changes in the surface electronics as particle size and supports change. The aim is to provide a complete picture of how Au catalysts are affected by particle size and support effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis RUI proposal will have a substantial impact on undergraduate education at Trinity University.  Funds will be used to support several undergraduate researchers, who will be integral participants in this study.  Further, initial research opportunities will be targeted to undergraduates early in their academic careers (1st and 2nd year students).  This offers increased opportunities to capture students from underrepresented groups and capitalize on their interests in science, and thereby developing important human resources for our increasingly technical economy.  Integrating the Trinity model that focuses on undergraduate research with a classic graduate experience at Penn State will provide a unique educational opportunity for all of the participants and will help to maximize the impact of the research performed by the undergraduates.",

These gold nanoparticles are the most active heterogeneous catalysts known for CO oxidation to CO2.  This project developed a detailed understanding of the important factors that influence the catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles, particularly for CO oxidation. Reaction rate measurement were used to understand the molecular changes that occur during the reaction (the reaction mechanism). We provided clear evidence that water participates in the reaction by donating a proton to O2 as it is bound to the gold.  We also developed new chemical methods for measuring / understanding how the underlying support affects the electron richness / poorness of the Au nanoparticles, and how this, in turn, affects the catalytic reaction chemistry. \n\nThis new knowledge allowed us to explore an important industrial reaction:  the preferential oxidation of CO in hydrogen.  Hydrogen is usually produced by reacting steam with methane (the primary component in natural gas) to ultimately yield hydrogen gas and CO2.  Unfortunately, this reaction does not go to completion and there is always around 1% CO remaining in the hydrogen.  Just as CO poisons people, it also poisons catalysts later on in industrial processes, so it must be removed.  One way to remove this CO is with the preferential oxidation of CO (PrOx) reaction.  The goal in this reaction is to add a small amount of oxygen and react all of the CO away but not touch the hydrogen.  Gold is notoriously bad at binding and activating hydrogen, so we applied our mechanistic knowledge of CO oxidation over Au to the PrOx reaction. By carefully controlling the amount of water on the surface of the catalyst as well as the flow rate of the gas over the catalysts, we made the largest improvements in catalyst performance in over a decade, far surpassing a key industrial goal. \n\nThe broader impacts of this project are potentially significant.  The world produces over 70 million tons of hydrogen per year, primarily for fertilizer, petroleum refining, and industrial chemicals production.  This accounts for 3-5% of all global energy use every year.  Consequently, improvements in hydrogen production and purification may have a significant impact on global energy use and CO2 emissions.  The fundamental understanding of Au oxidation chemistry that we developed directly led to advances in the PrOx reaction, and to a patent that has been filed with the USPTO.  Further, this project directly contributed to the education of 8 undergraduates, including a female African &ndash;American student who is now in the Chemical Engineering Graduate Program at Rice University.    \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert M Rioux"
