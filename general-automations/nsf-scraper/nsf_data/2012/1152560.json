 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project advances CohortFS, a replicated, parallel storage platform for cloud computing.  CohortFS offers unique capabilities for data partitioning, secure data access and retention, and flexible management of storage at very-large scale, with seamless federation across geographically dispersed, separately-managed data centers.  CohortFS improves the flexibility and simplicity of cloud storage management and facilitates uniform management of distributed volumes, whether local, remote, or in the cloud.  The CohortFS model for transparent encryption protects data from storage providers and others in shared data center facilities, a key consideration for cloud data privacy and security which are consistently found to be the primary barriers to adoption of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and cloud storage. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes advancement of standards-based storage infrastructure, advancement of both open source and proprietary storage technologies, and development of high-value software infrastructure that can be readily commercialized.  CohortFS innovations in wide area replication and flexible data placement improve storage performance and manageability in public and private clouds.  Using the cloud as an enabling medium, CohortFS translates advances in petascale data organization and secure, wide-area replication to broader markets and commercial sectors. By improving the economy and utility of storage at cloud scale, CohortFS widens the applicability of cloud computing, speeds its adoption, and deepens its impact?goals strongly supportive of the broader NSF mission.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcome (Phase II)\nThe CohortFS research and development effort produced novel mechanisms for flexible data organization for cloud computing, made several ancillary contributions to Network File System Version 4 (NFSv4), a widely adopted standard for distributed file access.  The CohortFS team achieved dramatic improvements in the end-to-end I/O performance of (a restricted version of) Ceph, an open-source distributed storage system with wide adoption in cloud computing (e.g., Ceph was in 2015 the most widely deployed storage subsystem for the OpenStack cloud computing platform, is used by Cisco, Yahoo, Verizon, among others).\n\n \nImpact/Benefits\nThe CohortFS effort advanced the state of the art in software-defined storage systems, an important technology segment within cloud computing.  Software developed by the CohortFS team in the course of its Phase I and Phase II research projects have been incorporated in commercial products from several vendors (e.g., IBM, Red Hat, others).\n\n \nBackground/Explanation\nThe most significant innovation developed by CohortFS is flexible placement.  The mechanism permits a wide range of distinct storage activities, potentially by different data-owners or tenants, to be serviced by a single storage cluster.  Ancillary innovations by the CohortFS team extended the applicability of the Ceph storage system by integrating with NFSv4, a standards-based distributed file access protocol.  An extension of the NFS protocol to support end-to-end file system encryption (increasing the security of data stored in remote data centers) was also developed.  Finally, the CohortFS Phase I project designed and implemented replication layouts, a novel replication mechanism integrated with NFS.\n\n \nImages/Videos\nN/A\n\n \nDoes this Highlight Represent Potentially Transformative Research?\nThe CohortFS research results summarized here represent advances in an evolving technology framework (software-defined storage) which has had and continues to have transformative impact, by enabling cloud computing.  Due to the acquisition of CohortFS by Red Hat, Inc and Red Hat\u00c6s efforts to include CohortFS technology into the core of the Ceph distributed storage system, the technology developed by CohortFS has the potential for significant impact on open-source software defined storage and cloud-hosted storage systems in a broad cross-section of the computing industry.\n\n \nIntellectual Merit\nThe CohortFS flexible placement mechanism extends the capabilities of deterministic placement strategies in distributed storage.  The precursor to flexible placement used in the Ceph distributed storage system--CRUSH, with several precursors invented by Brian Miller et al at UC Santa Cruz--provides a mechanism for efficiently distributing data throughout a computing cluster, with minimal intervention from central metadata servers.  CRUSH can be customized through rules, subject to specific constraints.  Flexible placement provides increased flexibility, introducing a new placement system abstraction and defining a set of mechanisms for creating, propagating, and recalling placement systems while the storage cluster is in operation.  Code generation and execution sandboxing are used to safely propagate dynamically-generated data placement logic.  In addition, CohortFS demonstrated that flexible placement can be layered onto existing data placement abstractions in Network File System Version 4 (NFSv4), a standards-based distributed file system access protocol, extending the capabilities of pNFS (the parallel extension of NFS).\n \nThe flexible placement and replication layout technologies developed by CohortFS have been formalized as US patents (US 9,146,937 and US 9,098,201).  The CohortFS technology and research team have been acquired by Red Hat.  Work is ongoing to integrate CohortFS into the Ceph code base used by Red Hat customers and others around the world.\n\n \nLineage\n\nThe CohortFS SBIR Phase II research extended earlier research under..."
