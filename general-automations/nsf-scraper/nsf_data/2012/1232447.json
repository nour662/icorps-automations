 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: This qualitative research investigation by an interdisciplinary team of scholars at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is exploring factors that influence Latinas' decision to major in and persist in computer science and/or engineering as a course of study. The theoretical frame of the study includes a socio-cultural theory of identity in which identity is dynamically shaped and mediated by personal, socio-economic status, linguistic and cultural knowledge, beliefs, and values. Researchers are interviewing between 20-30 graduating seniors and 2nd year majors in depth about their experiences as computer science and/or engineering majors.  Data gathering also includes participant observation protocols and focus groups.  Data are analyzed using discourse analysis and life charting as interconnected interpretative practices for analysis. The expected outcome is new knowledge and theory building that could eventually inform a wide audience of stakeholders of how to support positive factors (and counter negative factors) that influence career choice and persistence among Latinas.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed work will contribute to the body of knowledge and build new theories around Latinas' recruitment to, retention and completion of degrees in computer science and engineering. Currently, there is a lack of research that focuses solely on Latinas in these disciplines. The findings will lay the groundwork for further studies that can advise stakeholders of ways to modify and extend the educational and experiential approaches to broadening participation of Latinas in engineering. Understanding the mitigating factors, such as socio-economic class, language, cultural knowledge, beliefs, family dynamics and values, that influence Latinas' education and career choices in computer science and engineering could inform appropriate interventions in educational settings and outreach programs.  The investigators will disseminate the results and recommendations through publications and presentations.",
