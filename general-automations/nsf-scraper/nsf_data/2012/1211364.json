 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of the equations derived to model physical phenomena support some form\r\nof special solutions such as standing or traveling waves, or other coherent\r\nstructures. These special solutions often correspond  to real, observable\r\nphysical phenomena in the systems that these model equations are meant to\r\nrepresent. One important aspect of this modeling is the stability of these\r\nspecial solutions, as the stability of solutions determines if these\r\nsolutions are likely to be physically observed. This project is aimed at\r\nunderstanding the stability and instability these coherent structures.\r\nThis usually amounts to computing the index of the operator found by\r\nlinearizing about one of these coherent structures - that is the number of\r\neigenvalues of positive real part.  This counts the dimension of the\r\nunstable manifold to the solution, giving valuable information on the\r\ndynamics of nearby solutions. While the emphasis of this project is on\r\nconservative systems we consider both conservative and dissipative systems.\r\nWe use analytical, asymptotic and geometric techniques to identify unstable\r\neigenvalues and to count the number of such eigenvalues.\r\n\r\nThere are many mathematical models that are important for science and\r\nengineering that support solutions in the form of traveling waves. One\r\nexample is an equation known as the Korteweg-DeVries equation, an equation\r\nwhich governs the behavior of water in a narrow shallow body such as a\r\ncanal. The Korteweg-DeVries equation has solutions called solitary waves\r\nwhich behave just as experience would suggest - they correspond to a\r\nquantity of water which propagates along without changing shape. Similar\r\nequations govern the propagation of light waves, propagation of a\r\ndisturbance through a network such as the power grid, etc. It is\r\nimportant to understand the extent to which these solutions accurately\r\nmodel the behavior of the underlying system. This is the question of\r\nstability, which measures how robust these special solutions are. If a\r\nspecial solution like a traveling wave is stable it means that nearby\r\nsolutions behave in a similar way. This means such solutions are robust,\r\nand are likely to be observed: if the conditions are not exactly those\r\nnecessary to produce a traveling wave but are close we expect to see a\r\nsolution which is close to the special one. An unstable solution, on the\r\n other hand, is not robust. In order to observe these unstable solution\r\none must produce exactly the right conditions, which is very difficult\r\nto achieve in practice. This means that such solutions are more of\r\n mathematical interest than of physical importance. This project is\r\nprimarily concerned with developing mathematical techniques to understand\r\n the stability of traveling waves  in a number of models including the\r\n Kuramoto model (a model for the behavior of power networks) and several\r\n nonlinear dispersive equations (which govern light waves in nonlinear\r\n media, water waves, waves in plasmas and many other phenomena).",
