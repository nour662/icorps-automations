 "awd_abstract_narration": "A broad understanding of orographic precipitation processes is vital to the forecasting of heavy rain, floods, and severe weather.  Most precipitation on earth occurs in connection with frontal systems, convective storms, or tropical cyclones.  The precipitation of these storms is enhanced, redistributed and concentrated when the storms occur near or over mountains.  This study tries to advance understanding of these effects, for all three types of storms.  The research effort will be based on existing but not fully exploited datasets from several field campaigns.  High-resolution model simulations with several of the latest ice-phase microphysical schemes will supplement the field observation studies.  The study leverages collaborations to facilitate examination of a range of storm types near different mountain ranges (Alps, Cascades, Canadian Coast Mts., Sierra Nevada, Andes, Himalayas, and Taiwan Central Mts.).\r\n\r\nFor frontal systems passing over mountain ranges, this research will test hypotheses of precipitation enhancement suggested by the MAP and IMPROVE II field programs and determine if these ideas have applicability to storms in the vicinities of diverse mountain ranges. In particular, data from SNOW-V10 will be used to determine the existence and characteristics of decoupled flows, accompanying shear, and down-valley flows in the mountain setting of the Canadian western coast.  Comparison of data from Alps, Coast Mountains, and Sierra Nevada range will be used to determine whether the turbulence in these layers has the specific form of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves.  The development of decoupled layers by barrier jet formation will be explored by model simulation of fronts approaching the Andes. \r\n\r\nFor convective systems, we will examine the triggering and downstream development of intense convective systems as a result of the impingement of low-level flow on mountains and the enhancement of mesoscale convective systems passing over large mountains.  The triggering mechanism will be examined with model simulations and data analysis in the Andean region. The modeling will test the hypothesis that orographic subsidence holds back the deep convection by capping of the moist low-level moist jet until the jet breaks the cap by striking a foothill. Downstream evolution of the orogenic convection into a mesoscale system will be examined with the model. The enhancement of a mesoscale convective system passing over steep terrain will be examined by simulating the 2010 Leh flood case over the Himalayas.  The precipitation mechanisms in the orographically triggered and modified convective systems will be examined using radar data from operational and research radars in Taiwan.\r\n\r\nFor tropical cyclones, Taiwan radar data will be analyzed for Typhoon Morakot (2009), which caused devastating flooding when its rain was orographically enhanced.  We will explore the hypotheses that warm-rain growth was crucial to the enhancement, and model simulations will test the results.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: \r\nThe results of this study will improve basic understanding of the role of mountains in affecting all major precipitation systems across the globe.  The research will use existing but unexploited field campaign datasets and the latest versions of high-resolution numerical forecast models to examine the precipitation processes occurring in all major storm types (fronts, convective storms, and tropical cyclones) when they occur near or over mountains.  Inclusion of all major storm types and examination over geographically separated mountain ranges will achieve generality.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nImproved observations and understanding of how mountains affect precipitation will lead to improved prediction of severe flooding, hail, tornadoes, and winds.  The storms investigated in this study have caused hundreds of casualties and great property damage, and the research will incorporate investigation of their human impacts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF-funded \u00e6Orographics Effects\u00c6 study served to better understand mountainous precipitation around the world.  This was a broad-scope study that included a close examination of several different  mountainous regions across the globe:  precipitation events in the Andes, European Alps, Himalayas, Cascades, Rockies and Sierra Nevada were compared and contrasted.\n\n\nThe research under this grant sought to examine how the precipitating clouds of deep convection, frontal systems, and tropical cyclones are influenced by the presence of hills and mountains.\n\nSome key findings over the course of study:\n\n* Near the Himalayas, deadly flash flooding is an issue for residents of the mountainous valleys.  During one of these extreme rain events in Pakistan, it was determined that mountain storms interacted with unusual moisture steering in from the Bay of Bengal to produce life-threatening \nconditions.  It was found that ingredients were similar to those that resulted in flash flooding events in Colorado and South Dakota in the 1970s:  thunderstorms at the edge of mountainous terrain joined up with moist flow steering upslope from a neighboring plateau, causing heavy rain to veer into and fall in mountainous valleys.  This discovery could help predict future high terrain flash-flooding events, helping to save human life and property.\n\n* Some of the most intense convection in the world occurs east of the Andes Mountains, and it was found that the mountains play a key role in the development of such heavy precipitation. When moist flow in combination with a passing upper level trough encounters mountainous terrain near the Andes, heavy rain and severe hail results, often leading to crop and property damage.  Additionally, it was found that the orographic precipitation process near the Andes is similar to that east of the Rockies and near the mountainous terrain in South Asia.\n\n* Another comparison of two distinct global regions was drawn when studying the intense precipitation processes that lead to flooding in northern India and in Colorado in 2013.  In both of these cases, the flooding was the result of shallower, persistent large-scale flow with embedded convection. Finding such similarities on a global scale can lead to better computer modeling and forecasting, protecting life and property during future flooding events.\n\n* In the Sierra Nevada mountain range, the windward slopes of the terrain create wind shear (changing wind direction and speed with height) and thus, turbulence. This turbulence acts to enhance both rain rate and precipitation accumulation as Pacific frontal systems move across the mountainous terrain.\n\n* The Alps are another example of an area where mid-latitude storms encounter a mountain range and the airflow is impacted by orography. It was determined that storms hitting the Alps created three distinct levels of airflow, and therefore, wind shear.  Turbulence within the shear takes on a Kelvin-Helmholtz wave structure, and also contributes to the orographic enhancement of precipitation.  Similar results have been found over the Sierra Nevada range and the Cascade Mountains of Oregon and Washington.\n\n* In tropical cyclones, the tangential winds encountering a mountain range have been seen to produce a gravity-wave response and greatly enhanced upslope flow. Depending on the height of the mountain, the maximum rain may occur on either the windward or leeward side. Intense convection usually occurs when the eye of a tropical cyclone passes over a mountain. \n\nIn short, the presence of mountainous terrain will greatly impact the precipitating capability of an atmospheric disturbance, no matter the location, type, or size. This research will underpin improvements in the prediction of rainfall affected by mountainous terrain. The work on fundamental processes of orographic precipitation accomplished in this study will provide guidance for improvement of regional weather forecast models in the U.S. and other midlatitude ..."
