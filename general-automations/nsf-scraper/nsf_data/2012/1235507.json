These are 5-day events held in Washington. The aim is to provide leadership skills to a cohort of 25 early career scientists capable of participating in collaborative research and science planning. The symposium will include formal presentations, group discussions, and mentoring. The goal is to increase the effectiveness of early career scientists as they enter the marine geosciences community, not only in the classroom and laboratory, but also as leaders in the broader effort to increase geoscience literacy.",
