 "awd_abstract_narration": "All animals, including humans, experience injury, and every species examined shows adaptive responses to help avoid injury or re-injury. Injury to humans causes pain, which can be long lasting (even permanent) and sometimes untreatable. Although much has been learned about other aspects of human biology through comparative studies of simpler animals, including selected invertebrates, systematic comparative studies of behavioral and neural responses to injury in invertebrates have been lacking. This project will compare behavioral and neural responses to peripheral injury in two invertebrates that, because of their giant neurons, have been sources of pioneering discoveries in neuroscience: the common Atlantic squid, Loligo, and a large marine snail, Aplysia. Both are molluscs, but they have very different life styles and cognitive capabilities. Hypotheses to be tested include: (1) In the peripheral sensory neurons of both species, injury-induced, long-lasting behavioral sensitization involves a similar long-term enhancement of responsiveness that resembles the effects reported in mammals, (2) these changes are induced by common chemical signals that also drive inflammatory pain in mammals, (3) the large-brained squid, but not small-brained snail display ongoing awareness of an injury, and (4) sensitization of defensive responses in the squid increases the chances of survival in a wounded state by decreasing the vulnerability to predatory attacks. The broader impacts of this research project will be the encouragement of the use of molluscs to explore the evolution of fundamental behavioral patterns involving core mechanisms that are widely conserved and may be important for human pain, and the education of future scientists (including undergraduates) interested in comparative and evolutionary approaches to behavioral neurobiology. The resulting scientific information will be published in scientific journals and disseminated to foster rational and humane treatment of molluscs and other invertebrates in research.",

While <em>Aplysia</em> has often been used to study injury-induced neural alterations that increase behavioral responsiveness, almost nothing was known about the behavioral responses of squid or any of its cephalopod relatives (octopus, cuttlefish, and nautilus) to injury.

Like mammalian nociceptors, but unlike nociceptors in <em>Aplysia</em> or those described in any other invertebrate, squid nociceptors can begin to fire electrical impulses spontaneously and continue firing spontaneously for days after an injury (normally nociceptors are electrically silent and only fire when something stimulates them, such as a sharp poke). In mammals spontaneous firing of nociceptors results in ongoing pain. A surprising finding was that spontaneous firing and hypersensitivity was not restricted to nociceptors having branches close to an injury site but spread to nociceptors all over the body. This suggests that a squid is persistently \"aware\" of the fact of that it has been injured but lacks information about the location of the injury. It also suggests that awareness of injury may not require a massive neural network that integrates enormous amounts of information, as has been suggested for mammalian awareness of pain. It raises the possibility that even some relatively simple brains might have evolved the capacity to experience just the important fact that injury has occurred (the raw experience of pain) in the absence of the many other aspects of pain familiar to humans such as its location, quality, relationship to previous experience, and implications for the future.
