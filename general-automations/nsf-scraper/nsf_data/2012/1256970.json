 "awd_abstract_narration": "A network of data loggers and sediment traps was deployed by researchers for the University of Arizona in three lakes on three islands to monitor meteorological, limnological, and sedimentation variability as a function of climate changes in the region.  The dominant interannual variability is caused by ENSO and during the period of deployment the region exhibited a minor El Nino (2009-2010) followed by modest La Nina conditions (2010-2011).  The region is now in a neutral state with predictions of an El Nino beginning again in winter 2012-2013.  The data loggers are filled to capacity and need to be retrieved, downloaded and replaced.  In addition sediment traps contain the particle rain related to the transition from the week/moderate El Nino to the 2010 La Nina.  Replacement with new traps will permit observations of the transition back into El Nino conditions.\r\n\r\nThis project will support the research of two early career scientists: Jessica Conroy, an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow now at Georgia Tech, and Diane Thompson, an advanced graduate student from the University of Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis an excellent proposal for RAPID funding because:  1) the data collection systems are full and should be replaced this fall before the onset of the next El Nino: 2) the sediment traps will have a record of the most recent La Nina and immediate research progress will occur by retrieving and processing these samples; 3) two early career scientists have studies underway (begun during their Ph.D. thesis research) which will benefit greatly from this field program; 4) the redeployment of new monitors will be in place prior to the beginning of the next El Nino.",
