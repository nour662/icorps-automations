These membrane-based processes utilize the osmotic gradient that develops between solutions of differing concentrations, which are separated by a semi-permeable membrane, to effect a more efficient separation or to sustainably generate power. However, despite the potential of these technologies to address the global water and energy challenges, osmotically-driven membrane processes have yet to progress significantly beyond conceptualization. The major impediment to advancing these technologies is the lack of an adequate membrane, because the performance of current membranes is significantly hampered by the phenomenon of internal concentration polarization.  Similar diffusion-controlled phenomena in other processes have been improved by introducing a convective component of mass transfer. Therefore, this work will take inspiration from the field of microfluidics, where mixing fluids on the micrometer length is of utmost importance, and fabricate membranes for osmotically-driven membrane processes with static mixer-like features to minimize the deleterious effects of internal concentration polarization.  To achieve this goal, a phase separation micromolding technique will be used to fabricate high-performance membranes for osmotically-driven membrane processes. The research will also develop a fundamental understanding of how the mixer geometry impacts the overall mass transfer and membrane performance in order to optimize the membrane structure.  \r\n\r\nThe research addresses two of the major global challenges of our time: water scarcity and clean energy. Accomplishing this research will provide the scientific base and methodology to fabricate robust membranes that can find application in a variety of processes, including seawater and brackish water desalination, wastewater reclamation and reuse, and renewable power generation by pressure retarded osmosis.  This work is also the first to directly incorporate static mixer-like features into the structure of asymmetric salt-rejecting membranes, with potential applications in a broad range of separation processes.",

If this mixing energy can be harnessed to generate power, the global potential would be enormous, equal to a significant fraction of the worldwide power demand. Research on methods to extract energy from salinity gradients has grown rapidly, and pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) has emerged as one of the most promising technologies. In PRO, a semipermeable membrane placed between a low concentration feed solution and a high concentration draw solution (Figure 1). The chemical potential difference between the two solutions drives water molecules through the membrane from the feed to the draw solution while solutes are retained. The volume expansion in the draw solution is then restricted to increase the hydraulic pressure of the draw reservoir, and the resulting pressurized flow of water is driven through a hydro turbine to generate power.\n\nThe overall goal of our project was to advance the PRO process by fabricating and characterizing membranes that are both mechanically robust and allow for fast water transport.  Specific objectives included (i) tailoring techniques to fabricate pressure-resistant membranes for osmotically-driven membrane processes, (ii) developing a fundamental understanding of how membrane structure impacts overall membrane performance, and (iii) combining the knowledge gained through these studies to optimize membrane structure and understand key challenges to move PRO technology forward.\n\nWe began our studies by demonstrating high pressure PRO operation using membranes with a very thin polyamide separation layer and a polyester woven mesh embedded within the polysulfone support layer.  We found that the spacer that supports the membrane is a critical consideration for high pressure operation, and we used tightly woven fabric spacers in our design (Figure 2).  Using the fabric spacers and improved membranes, we were able to operate at pressures up to 48 bar, more than twice as high as the previous highest operating pressure in literature (Figure 3).  The high operating pressure allows for more efficient operation with high concentration draw solutions, enabling more power to be extracted per unit of membrane area than in any prior study.\n\nAfter developing a system that operating under increased pressures, we set out to characterize the membrane system and developed new methods to determine fundamental membrane properties during operation.  From this testing, we were able optimize the operating conditions of the system to allow for improved performance.  Additionally, we discovered that the salt rejection of membranes decreases at higher concentrations, a critical concern for PRO, which contacts membrane with more saline solutions that other processes that use similar membranes.  The methods we used to characterize membrane are explained in great detailed in our publications; they can easily be used by other researchers to understand their own results.\n\nWith the results from membrane characterization, we conducted modeling to understand how our small-scale experiments translate to the performance of full-scale PRO systems.  This modeling accounted for imperfect selectivity and mass transfer resistances in the membrane.  One of the major conclusions from the modeling studies was that relatively low concentration differences, such as river water and seawater, have a low energy extractable per unit volume.  Higher concentration gradients, such as those available from hypersaline lakes mixing with river water can offer an extractable energy up to an order of magnitude greater than river water and seawater.\n\nFinally, we evaluated the overall feasibility of PRO in different configurations.  We considered the inevitable losses during operation from various inefficiencies and the energetic costs of operation from pretreatment and pumping.  The results of this evaluation for river water and seawater system are shown in Figure..."
