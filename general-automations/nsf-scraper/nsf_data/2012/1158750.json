 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovations in product quality and production methods are a major source of long run growth in output per capita.  During this period of globalization it is very important to understand how investment in research and development (R&D) leads to innovations.  Many countries subsidize activities that are intended to make firms more competitive in the world market.  Empirical answers to questions regarding R&D require one to quantify how demand changes in response to the introduction of new goods and how supply changes in response to innovations in production. \r\n\r\nUntil recently almost all research on these questions use data that aggregate over prices and quantities so the measure of output is plant-level revenue. Aggregating prices and quantities over products at the plant confounds the effects of demand and supply, undermining the conclusions that can be drawn from such data.  More recent plant-level surveys include firm-level data on both the revenues and quantities of each product sold, in addition to data on inputs used in production and for product and process-related R&D. This research agenda will develop a methodology for estimating demand, output production and the production of innovations using these new and richer data sets.  \r\n\r\nApplying the methodology will yield estimates that can be used to answer some of the long-standing questions related to R&D.  A leading question in this literature is whether firms are doing too little or too much R&D from society's perspective, as economic theory says that forces can work in both directions.  Other important questions include how R&D \"produces\" innovations as a function of detailed input measurements, how spillovers of R&D knowledge impact growth, and whether past approaches to answering these questions with more aggregated data led to correct or mistaken inferences about the relationship between R&D and growth.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  In an attempt to encourage firms to become more competitive in this age of globalization many countries, including the United States, subsidize R&D.  By providing answers to the above questions, this research will shed new light on the most effective way to allocate these subsidies. The data also come from a period when European Union tariffs were falling, making it possible to explore how stiffening competition affects R&D decisions, and how these decisions affect product and process innovations and the competitiveness of domestic firms. The techniques will be programmed in Stata and made publicly available so researchers in other countries that collect similar data can directly apply the new methods.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe have evaluated the importance of research and development on consumer and producer welfare by using new detailed micro level data and showing how both to take advantage of this micro level data but also how to use multiproduct level data to estimate supply.  Coupled together one can estimate changes in consumer and producer welfare from e.g.  a change in the subsidy to R+D research.\n\n \n\nOur results suggest that R+D is very costly and risky for firms to undertake given the uncertainty with the outcomes of R+D research.  However to remain competitive they must take risky investments with unknown demand outcomes to remain competitive.  Demand for new products can be very inelastic and inelastic demands can lead to large markups.  Hence the incentive to undertake very very risky investments - the payoffs can be enormous and long-lived, especially if the firm is able to acquire a patent for the product.\n\nThere is no question more important than how firms choices to invest in new products - whether it be minivans, satellite dish, medical innovations - whatever it might be there is no question that product innovation is critical to the improvement in our standard of living and our paper has contributed on many major margins of how one measures these margins on both the demand and supply side.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amil K Petrin"
