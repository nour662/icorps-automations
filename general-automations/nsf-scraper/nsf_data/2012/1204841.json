 "awd_abstract_narration": "1204841\r\nHarmon\r\n\r\nIn many arid and semi-arid regions of the world, including much of Western U.S., water resources management plans are predicated on the assumption that the snow pack holds the majority of the water, gradually melting to replenish the reservoirs as their supplies are metered out to satisfy human water and power demands, and environmental flow mandates.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, the remote and sparsely populated mountain range providing the water and power for millions of people.  While it is known that this mountain range's steep gradients in elevation, soils and vegetation render it extremely sensitive to climate change, the connection between the underlying hydrologic processes and the water sustainability issues in these regions is not well understood.  This project will quantify the effect of a range of documented climate change scenarios on snow melt, runoff, high elevation reservoir operation (hydropower, flood control and recreation) and low elevation multi-purpose reservoir operation (irrigation, flood control, environmental flows and recreation).  The San Joaquin River Basin will serve as the prototype for this study, the outcomes of which will be transferrable to other snowpack-controlled river basins.  The scientific goal of the proposed project is to connect our emerging process-level understanding of climatic influences on mountain hydrologic processes and resulting changes to the stream response to the ecosystems services sustained by water but dictated by human values and policies.    The hypothesis is that changing climate variability in the semi-arid western U.S., and the resulting shift toward an earlier annual runoff in snow-dominated watersheds will create a ripple effect, propagating down the mountain front to force human responses in the form of changes to high elevation hydropower and lowland water supply reservoir operations, and therefore changes to lowland aquatic and riparian ecosystem functions.  We will test this hypothesis using current hydrologic process simulation models integrate existing data from the NSF Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory, and from state (California Department of Water Resources) and federal agencies (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service).  These simulation models will be driven by archival Global Climate Model (GCM) outputs (temperature, precipitation) for the years 2010 - 2099.\r\n\r\nThis project will clarify the connection between likely climate change scenarios, stream flows, reservoir storage and releases, and groundwater storage and extractions for snow-dependent river basins.  Furthermore, through engagement with key river basin stakeholders, the project will result in practical guidelines to how best to adapt policy to the changing hydrologic conditions in order to sustain water supply, energy and aquatic ecosystem needs in the future.  The San Joaquin River basin was selected as the subject of study because it embodies water and sustainability issues in the semi-arid West given (1) its vulnerability to climatic variation due to its reliance on snow pack and a network of reservoirs for hydropower, flood control, and water supply; and (2) its massive lowland river salmon restoration effort, which was initiated in Fall 2009.",

Our main goal was to determine how the changes in water availability would affect humans in the valley below, and how they might adapt to preserve what is important to their way of life. Such regions exist primarily in the Western U.S., and similar regions of the world. We focused on the San Joaquin River basin in California, a good example of a region that depends heavily on snow melt to replenish large reservoirs during the spring and early summer. These reservoirs then supply water for agriculture, drinking water, hydropower, and aquatic ecosystems through the hot, dry summer. Instead of collecting new data, we analyzed existing data from a large number of federal and state funded projects in the region. We used computer models to simulate precipitation (snow and rain) on and runoff from mountain slopes, infiltration into groundwater, and flow in rivers. &nbsp;Our technical work resulted in the following major outcomes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is well-known that warming climate results in more rain and less snow in the mountains given similar precipitation timing and amounts in the future. While others have linked the increasing rain to earlier mountain runoff and more rapid filling of downhill reservoirs, our findings were different. We found that the change in runoff differed substantially with soil type and soil thickness along the mountain front. In fact, we found that in some areas the amount of runoff could decrease because the warming conditions may lead to more water uptake by the trees and shrubs. This finding is significant because we are just learning how to obtain better data on soil depth and underground water storage capacity in rugged mountain environments. It will be important to California and similar regions to continue to study the subsurface environment in the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s Critical Zone Observatories and related research initiatives.</li>\n<li>In the valley below the reservoirs, we also looked at river flows and temperatures in response to the timing and amount of flow releases from those reservoirs. In addition to supplying human water and power needs, environmental mandates often require these reservoirs to release certain flows to sustain critical aquatic ecosystems. The San Joaquin River Restoration Program, for example, requires reservoir releases to help sustain the restoration of the Spring Run Chinook Salmon. Using San Joaquin River station data as inputs to a river model, we found the current summer conditions were simply too hot and mandated flows too low to sustain the cooler water conditions preferred by the salmon, in all places further than a few miles from the dam. These conditions will pose a problem for salmon returning to spawn during the summer months, and will only become more challenging as warming continues. To improve the river temperatures, large increases in the summer flows would be necessary, which would prove costly to the major agricultural enterprise that relies on the reservoir to feed its irrigation network. Perhaps more important is the fact that farmers tend to make up for losses in surface water (reservoir) allocations by pumping local groundwater, a practice that is less likely to be sustainable.</li>\n<li>We also explored adaptation strategies, focusing mainly on the use of reservoir released to enhance groundwater recharge in critical regions like the San Joaquin Valley. By ecologically engineering the land along the rivers, or by diverting floodwaters to cultivated fields that can tolerate water inundations, it is possible to store more water underground. This new storage can then be tapped by farmers when less reservoir water is available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to our technical research, we completed two major educational outreach activities related to the project. First, we worked with undergraduate students at UC Merced (Figure 1) to develop and interactive informational kiosk on water, climate and sustainability. We installed the kiosk at the Fresno River Center in December 2015 (Figure 2), a museum-type venue that is open to the public which regularly hosts Fresno school groups. The kiosk has engaged more than 1000 children and stakeholder adults to date. Second, our project team collaborated with related projects throughout Canada and South America, examining human-water themes from a socio-environmental perspective.
