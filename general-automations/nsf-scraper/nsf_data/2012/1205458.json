 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nWith the advances in the hardware technology and ever-decreasing cost of imaging circuitry, cameras have become\r\nubiquitous in our lives. The large amounts of video data generated by multiple cameras necessitate automatic\r\nanalysis of activities from video. With the introduction of smart cameras, it has now become viable to install\r\nmany spatially-distributed cameras interconnected by wireless links. A smart camera is a stand-alone unit that\r\nnot only captures images, but also includes a processor, memory and communication interface. This project\r\ntakes a holistic view of the problems that need to be solved to build scalable, battery-powered wireless smart-\r\ncamera networks (Wi-SCaNs). It focuses on providing a unifying solution to perform tasks distributively, and\r\ncommunicate in a P2P fashion over wireless links while making e\u00b1cient use of limited resources, such as energy\r\nand bandwidth. This research explicitly considers the challenges of wireless channels, and addresses the issues\r\nof scarce resources, P2P protocol design and channel usage priorities simultaneously. The expected outcomes of\r\nthis project include light-weight vision algorithms that are portable to embedded smart cameras, characterization\r\nof the energy-bandwidth-delay tradeo\u00aes in Wi-SCaNs, e\u00b1cient resource allocation strategies, and P2P wireless\r\ncommunication protocols that leverage the knowledge of the wireless channel conditions. The outcomes will have\r\nan important positive impact, because they will fundamentally advance the automatic activity analysis solutions\r\nby providing installation of any number of cameras anywhere, and will \u00afnd wide-ranging applications including\r\nsurveillance in military, commercial or public scenarios, elderly care and wildlife monitoring.\r\n1",
