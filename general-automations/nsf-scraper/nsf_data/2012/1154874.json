 "awd_abstract_narration": "Procedural justice refers to people's evaluations of how fairly they are treated during decision-making processes. More than 30 years of research has demonstrated a strong relationship between perceptions of fair treatment and decision-related outcomes, including respect for decision-makers (e.g., legal authorities) and compliance with sanctions. While a few researchers have extended procedural justice theory to children, none have done so from a theoretically-grounded developmental perspective. This research examines minors? sensitivity to procedural treatment from the lens of social-cognitive domain theory, which holds that children's reasoning about morality differs depending on which domain that treatment belongs. Specifically, this study addresses the following questions: 1) How is age related to sensitivity in variations in procedural treatment?; 2) What kind of reasoning do children use when evaluating procedural treatment?; 3) What developmental differences exist in children's reasoning about procedural treatment? To answer these questions, the PI will employ a vignette design involving a scenario describing a transgression committed by a child followed by a punishment meted out by an authority (parent, teacher, or judge). The punishment context allows for the introduction of three components of procedural treatment: voice, consistency, and respect.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will inform both legal psychology and developmental psychology. In the field of legal psychology, the results will expand knowledge of whether procedural justice is highly relevant to children as it is adults. In the field of developmental psychology, the results will expand knowledge of domain theory into new territory -- reasoning about procedural treatment as a form of moral behavior. \r\n\r\nFinally, the research has potentially significant policy implications. Procedural justice dialogue has been used to advocate for children's increased in involvement in child custody and child protection decision-making. This research will begin to answer the question of whether and when such involvement is appropriate and beneficial.",
