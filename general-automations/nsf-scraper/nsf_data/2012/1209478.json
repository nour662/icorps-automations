 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Michael Adan Caballero of Colorado State University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Determining the origin of secreted fatty acids in a biofuel cyanobacterium,\" during the summer of 2012 at The University of Tokyo in Tokyo, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Naoki Sato. \r\n\r\nThe cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has been engineered to overproduce and export fatty acids, potentially revolutionizing the economics of algal biofuels. This research uses carbon-labeling to determine the source of these fatty acids, hypothesized to originate from either the fatty acid synthase or membrane lipids.  It is part of the global effort of developing sustainable bioenergy.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
