In particular, the workshop is bringing together Principal Investigators of both new and established STEP projects with representatives from regional Workforce Development organizations from around the country. The seeds of this effort lie in the experiences of the STEP project leadership at the University of Central Florida who have successfully engaged with staff at Workforce Central Florida (WCF), which is that region's authority for workforce planning, programs, and the regional labor market. The primary expected outcome of this workshop is the creation of a set of new partnerships between STEP grantees and Workforce Development organizations from the different projects' respective regions.",
