Important examples of spectral invariants are given by the\r\nindex of an elliptic operator, the determinant of the Laplacian on a\r\nRiemannian manifold, the eta invariant (or spectral asymmetry) of a\r\nself-adjoint elliptic operator, and the analytic torsion. On\r\nnon-compact or singular manifolds, the very definition of spectral\r\ninvariants is much more delicate.  The workshop will highlight recent\r\ndevelopments and new research directions in spectral geometry in\r\nsingular contexts (e.g., spectral invariants in the presence of cusps\r\nand edges, scattering theory for asymptotically regular non-compact\r\ngeometries, applications to moduli spaces and geometric structures,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\nThis award provides funding to defray the expenses of U.S.\r\nparticipants at this conference. The expected participants represent a\r\nbalanced mixture of senior and junior researchers and include some of\r\nthe most renowned experts on spectral invariants. This is a very\r\nactive field with many recent developments, and this workshop will\r\nprovide an important forum to advertise the state-of-the-art and an\r\nexcellent opportunity for collaboration. The webpage for the\r\nconference can be found at:\r\nhttp://www.crm.umontreal.ca/act/theme/theme_2012_2_en/invariants12_e.php",
