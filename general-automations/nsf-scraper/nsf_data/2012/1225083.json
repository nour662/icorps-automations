Leading research professionals in industry, academia, and government are scheduled to attend. The intent is to arrive at a far-reaching overview of infrared optoelectronics. One of the major goals of the Conference is to assess the current status and define future research directions in infrared optoelectronics. This will be achieved through presentations and open discussions of the key technical issues. \r\n\r\nBroader impact: \r\nIt is expected that this Conference will have a significant impact in defining future research in infrared optoelectronics. This Conference will also contribute to the training of participating graduate students and junior faculty through open discussion of the presented topics. A Conference Technical Digest will be disseminated to participants.",
