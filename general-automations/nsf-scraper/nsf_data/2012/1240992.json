 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Santa Fe Institute (SFI), in partnership with the University of New Mexico, the Supercomputing Challenge, and other educational organizations, industry partners, and local schools, proposes a project called New Mexico Computer Science for All (NM-CSforAll). NM-CSforAll?s primary targets middle and high school STEM teachers, preparing them to be future CS teachers. It offers a novel, interdisciplinary approach that uses modeling and simulation as the basis for teaching CS Principles, the proposed, new Advanced Placement (AP) CS course. Teachers first take the modeling and simulation version of CS Principles and then implement it as a dual credit course for their students. During a Spring semester-long course, the teachers investigate real-world problems, view them through the lens of complex systems--SFI's primary research area--and then model and analyze them using agent-based modeling techniques. The project uses a \"flipped\" classroom methodology, meaning the lecture portion of the course will be offered as online videos, while the exercise and project work will take place in the lab, face-to-face. A Summer workshop focuses on reviewing the CS content of the course, learning pedagogy, and recruitment techniques in preparation for the Fall semester implementation in the schools. The Fall implementation of the dual credit CS Principles class for high school students uses the videos developed for the teacher professional development course as lecture material and weekly \"lab\" session meetings led by participating teachers acting as learning coaches. (NM now requires a dual-credit, AP, or honors course for high school graduation and this course will fulfill the requirement.) NM CSforAll's secondary strategy fosters teachers' CS content learning, CS teaching pedagogy, and computer programming practice through engagement in a professional online community. NM-CSforAll's online network will include video sharing, uploading of documentation of work sessions, and social networking capabilities providing opportunities for teachers to learn from each other?s implementations of CS activities and communicate with each other, STEM educators, CS professionals and educational researchers. Teacher participants, as the co-creators of content for the site, will have shared authority, a critical factor in creating environments conducive to building knowledge about teaching and learning CS. The project evaluation will determine whether teacher professional development in CS that integrates computational modeling and analysis of complex systems, builds capacity in future CS teachers, and whether co-creation and use of an online professional development network can improve teachers' pedagogical skills and sustain their interest in CS.",

The course was developed, piloted and evaluated by the Santa Fe Institute, and later adapted, expanded and incorporated into sustainable educational pathways by the University of New Mexico (UNM).</p>\n<p>NM CSforAll dramatically increased the number and diversity of students learning Computer Science. 48 teachers completed NM CSforAll training and taught in a total of 52 high schools in 26 different school districts in New Mexico. Over 1000 high school students enrolled in NM CSforAll and 77% successfully completed and passed the course, most of them earning dual credit in their high schools and undergraduate credit at UNM. Of surveyed students, 75% were in at least one group underrepresented in CS (36% female, and 67% from underrepresented minority groups, including 20% Native American).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Undergraduate sections of the course were established at the UNM as the first CS course in New Mexico to count toward a core undergraduate graduation requirement (as a Natural Science laboratory course). A summer session of NM CSforAll was taught at UNM to a predominantly African American class, and those students have since won multiple awards from the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology and the NM Supercomputing Challenge. Another summer session was funded and taught by the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute to members of tribal colleges. Central New Mexico Community College will offer the course in the next academic year, further expanding the opportunity for college students and high school students to earn dual credit.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;Swarmathon&nbsp;Project Module (<a href=\"https://github.com/BCLab-UNM/netlogo-swarmathon)\">github.com/BCLab-UNM/netlogo-swarmathon)</a>, developed as part of the NM CSforAll curriculum, was used by over 300 high school students in 23 high schools across the US to compete in the 2017 virtual NetLogo high school NASA Swarmathon swarm robotics programming challenge. The project is continuing in 2018. The competition simulates teams of robots collecting resources prior to astronaut arrival as part of NASA's Journey to Mars (<a href=\"http://nasaswarmathon.com/outreach/\">http://nasaswarmathon.com/outreach/</a>).</p>\n<p>The project demonstrated that a hybrid course that offers college dual credit can be scaled up to teach CS to a rural, socio-economically disadvantaged and underrepresented population. In the first three years of the project, evaluations showed that 88% of students liked the course, and 100% of teachers rated the NM CSforAll training very good or excellent, and 21/22 teachers agreed it was the best training they had ever experienced. Evaluations also showed that teachers and students enrolled in the NM CSforAll program showed significant&nbsp;improvements in Knowledge and Skills and Interests and Attitudes about CS. Results are published by the project team in an \"exemplary paper\" at the 2017 conference of the Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGSCE).</p>\n<p>A partnership of faculty and graduate students in CS, education and learning sciences developed the Culturally Responsive Adaptive Teaching of Computational Science (CReATe-CS) framework. CReATe-CS is designed to expand the NM CSforAll curriculum to enable high school teachers and students to design more creative programs to solve problems that they care about. A pilot study showed that this was effective for improving interest and skills, particularly in students from underrepresented groups. Another pilot study showed that undergraduate students who completed NM CSforAll had significantly higher improvements on a math skills test than their peers who had not enrolled in a CS course. A partnership of five community colleges and universities and the New Mexico Public Education Department was established to expand CReATE-CS to more high schools across the state.</p>\n<p>The NM CSforAll course has been established as a UNM dual-credit course for high school students and as satisfying a&nbsp;prerequisite for entering the UNM Computer Science major. The course was evaluated as part of the UNM CS 2017 Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) review and is incorporated into the New Mexico undergraduate core course evaluation program, ensuring that the curriculum continues to meet learning objectives and high academic standards.</p>\n<p>Two UNM Graduate level courses (one in Computer Science and one in Education) have been established to train teachers and to provide support during teaching of NM CSforAll.
