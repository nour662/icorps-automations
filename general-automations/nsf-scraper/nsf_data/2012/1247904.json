 "awd_abstract_narration": "In hydraulic fracturing high pressures are applied to induce fractures within shale\r\nformations. Sand and other solid particles (known as proppants) are then injected to\r\nprevent the collapse of the fractures once the pressure is released.These propped\r\nfractures ease the extraction of natural gas/oil. Sand has the disadvantages of not\r\ndistributing evenly within the fractures, and of not reaching fractures far from the\r\nwellbore. This limits the amount of natural gas/oil that can be extracted from a given\r\nshale formation. Research is being conducted in materials sciences to produce\r\nproppantsthat are uniform in size (so that they will not clog the fractures),\r\nsmall (so that they canpenetrate narrow fractures), mechanically strong (to maintain the fractures open even\r\nwhen exposed to high subsurface pressures), and light (to diffuse farther from the\r\nwellbore, allowing the extraction of larger amounts of natural gas/oil from one fracture).\r\nThis proposal intends to explore whether Pickering emulsions could be used to prevent\r\nthe collapse of the hydraulic fractures once the pressure is released. Pickering emulsions\r\ne.g., water in oil) are stabilized by solid particles. They find numerous applications in\r\nareas as diverse as food preparation, cosmetics,drug delivery, and catalytic processes.\r\nThe results obtained so far in the PIs laboratory,summarized in the narrative, have been\r\nobtained for bulk Pickering emulsions.Such studies have quantified the effect of solid\r\nparticles on the water-decane interfacial tension, and the mechanism of dropletcoalescence.\r\nCurrent research is being conducted to clarify the interfacial structure anddynamical \r\nproperties for systems composed by mixtures of different solid particles.This proposal stems from the hypothesis that emulsions might allow for a bettercontrolled distribution of the proppants within a fracture, possibly far from the wellbore.\r\nIn the systems of interest the proppants will have the dual role of fracture stabilizers and\r\nemulsion formers.It is anticipated that once the emulsions are destabilized because of\r\nparticle-rock interactions,the proppants will adsorb onto the rock surface.By controlling\r\nthe emulsion stability within different sub-surface formations it will be possible to design shale-specific proppants.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research consists in the evaluation of a new\r\nmethod to inject proppants within hydraulic fractures (Pickering emulsions instead of\r\naqueous dispersions). If successful, this exploratory research could lead to the\r\nexploitation of larger amounts of the natural gas/oil stored in shale formations.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts. One post-doctoral researcher will conduct this exploratory research\r\nover a period of one year. The results obtained will be used to test our hypothesis. If\r\nsuccessful, the proposed research could bring enormous economical advantages to the\r\nnation because the hydraulic fracturing stage constitutes one of the most expensive stages\r\nin the well drilling, and because more natural gas will be produced from a single well.\r\nPotential impacts are also expected on other technologies (e.g., cosmetics and drugdelivery),\r\nas our research will lead to better fundamental understanding of Pickeringemulsions. \r\nThe research results will be integrated in teaching and outreach activities,\r\nfollowing our track record.",
