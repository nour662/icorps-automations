 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award trains the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists to design biodiversity conservation strategies in the face of novel environments, and develops an integrative program of experiential learning, engaged scholarship, and problem-focused research on biodiversity conservation.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Humans are now the dominant biogeographic, evolutionary, and climatic force on Earth. As we change the environment ever more rapidly, new climate conditions are emerging that have no historical analogs, novel ecosystems are flourishing, and people are creating new land use patterns and demographic, economic, and political realities. This program will support a community of practice in which social scientists, climatologists, ecologists, computer scientists, geneticists, economists, statisticians, remote sensing specialists and others collaborate in interdisciplinary teams to find solutions for future biodiversity conservation in novel environments.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This IGERT award advances discovery and understanding by integrating research and experiential learning, and by establishing and strengthening collaborations among disciplines within UW-Madison, and with partners in government, conservation organizations, and abroad. A participatory research approach will ensure broad dissemination of findings, thereby enhancing scientific understanding and social benefits. A suite of new graduate seminars will train students in collaborating, and in communicating with broader audiences, and in integrating research and education. Continuing feedback from agencies and communities will ensure that results are relevant for policy formulation at both state and national levels, and program elements have been designed to engage students from underrepresented groups in partnership with existing on- and off-campus organizations.\r\n\r\nIGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to establish new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, and to engage students in understanding the processes by which research is translated to innovations for societal benefit.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAll ecosystems change, but only some are exhibiting novelty.  Novelty occurs either in abiotic conditions, or biotic composition, or both.  Novelty occurs along gradients and can be measured.  Novelty is relative to a baseline in both time and space.  It is not meaningful to declare one ecosystem to be novel and another as not, but such false dichotomies are certainly seductive.  Scientifically, the most important contribution of our IGERT was to separate novelty clearly from change, and to make novelty something that can and should be measured.  Pedagogically, the hallmark of our IGERT were seminars in which faculty and students collaborated towards a product, such as a joint publication.  In these seminars, we explored the ramifications for novelty for biodiversity, and for conservation management.  The lesson learned was that a little bit of structure can greatly foster collaboration.\n\nBy the numbers, we trained 25 PhD students, of which 21 have graduated already, and the remaining ones are progressing nicely towards their degrees.  15% of our trainees were from underrepresented groups, far higher than in any of the ten PhD programs that IGERT trainees were enrolled in.  IGERT faculty taught 27 seminars, we organized two conference symposia, 6 training workshops, and one capstone symposium.  More than 500 students, postdocs, and faculty participated in IGERT activities.  The IGERT provided interdisciplinary collaborations across our campus, and resulted in numerous joint publications, and research grants based on new collaborations.  But most importantly, the IGERT pushed both trainees and faculty to think deeper about the way the world is changing, which of these changes constitute novelty, and what novelty entails for biodiversity and its conservation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/05/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Volker C Radeloff"
