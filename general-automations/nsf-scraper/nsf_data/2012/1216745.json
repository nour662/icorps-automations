 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formal modeling and verification technology has made significant advances in the last two decades.  Techniques like model checking and theorem proving are now used in both the hardware and software industries.  Formal techniques are also increasingly being used in scientific modeling, as for example in systems biology and in the engineering of complex cyber-physical systems.  The biggest challenge facing this technology is the lack of trained users and developers of this technology.  To address this gap, we started the Summer School in Formal Techniques.  The first such school was held in the Summer of 2011 at Menlo College in Atherton, California, with support from the National Science Foundation and SRI International.  The school attracted 80 participants with a diverse range of interests and backgrounds.  The lectures were rigorous and covered the spectrum of formal techniques including static analysis, model checking, theorem proving, invariant generation, compositional verification, and systems biology.  The second edition of the school builds on the success of the first one to develop a well-knit community of young researchers with a deep interest in formal methods.",
