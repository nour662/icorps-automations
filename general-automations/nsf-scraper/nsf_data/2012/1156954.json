 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site award has been made to Virginia Tech that will provide research training for 10 students for 10 weeks, during each of the summers of 2012- 2014.  The REU program trains students in research on a wide range of microbiological phenomena, covering both fundamental and applied topics and employing both genome-based technologies and focused approaches.  The program includes i) a student-led independent research project; ii) discussion sessions and seminars given by faculty members and an external speaker; iii) visits to specialized laboratories and research centers such as genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics facilities, the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, and the Center for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Diseases;  iv) workshops on responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and how to gain admission to graduate school and pursue graduate studies productively; v) visits to companies that utilize or study microbiological processes; vi) informal lunch meetings with mentors and graduate students; vii) weekly participant meetings aimed at sharing learning experiences; and viii) presentation of research results by each student in a seminar format at a mid-summer symposium and in a poster format at a campus-wide symposium at the end of the program.  Students are expected to do full-time research as well as participate in all site activities.  The site recruits through traditional \"hard copy\" formats as well as digital-based advertising.  Students are selected based on the potential for outstanding research as judged from academic transcripts, recommendation letters, and personal statements. Preference will be given to students who lack the opportunity to conduct research at their home institution. The program will emphasize participation of students from underrepresented groups.  Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in microbiology, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience.  The performance of the program will be assessed by various means, including an REU common assessment tool.  Additional information is available from the Program Director, Dr. Biswarup Mukhopadhyay (e-mail: biswarup@vt.edu, phone: 540 231 8015) or online at http://microbiologyreu-ret.vbi.vt.edu.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\n \n\nIn the 2012-2015 period this NSF-REU site titled Microbiology in the Post-genome Era trained 32 undergraduate students in cutting edge microbiology research using contemporary research problems in leading laboratories at Virginia Tech as platforms.  These students were selected from a pool of about 500 applicants from various parts of the country and Puerto Rico.  It also has trained 9 guest students who leveraged the expertise and infrastructure of the site and 5 of them were from a partnering HBCU; 7 of the NSF-funded students were also from this HBCU.  The major missions that the site accomplished were training the students in the genomics and bioinformatics approaches to microbiology research and energizing and preparing them for pursuing graduate studies in cutting edge biological science research. \n\n \n\nThis overall outcome was the result of a set of research and enrichment activities.  Each student selected a laboratory for their training from a pool of 30 mentoring laboratories, performed research focusing on an independent project tailored for a 10-week engagement, and were integrated in the laboratory as a full member.  In the process they experienced firsthand the research life in a microbiology laboratory, developed research skills, and tested their aptitudes and interests for Ph.D. research.  This experience was greatly enriched by the following activities:\n\n \n\nLearning to design a research project.\nLearning to communicate research to a layperson using a family member or a friend with little background in science as a platform. \nWeekly lectures and hands on guided computer exercises on the application of genome-based approaches and technologies and bioinformatics in microbiology research.\nWeekly seminars presented by the program mentors. Each was followed by a question, answer and discussion session.  \nWeekly informal lunchtime discussions with one of the mentors, or 2-3 graduate students and postdoctoral scientists.\nWeekly informal discussions among the REU students at a place and time of the students? choosing where they shared their experiences.  These sessions fostered peer learning.\nWeekly visits to specialized laboratories on the campus, especially the genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics facilities.\nLectures on Ethics in biological and biochemical research by specialists in the field.\nLectures on career opportunities for microbiologists with graduate degrees.\n\n\n10.  Lectures on opportunities of graduate work in microbiology, application process and admission to graduate programs, fellowships, and how to succeed in graduate studies.\n\n11.  Training in research communication skills which involved the following:\n\na. Training each student by the mentors.\n\nb.Presentation of a research seminar at a mid-summer seminar symposium and a research poster at the end-of-summer symposium by each participant.  The symposiums were attended by undergraduate and graduate students, research scientists, faculty members, mentors and the REU students.\n\n12.  Visit by a Microbiology expert from another university, research institute or industry.  This activity involved informal discussions and lunch and dinner meetings with the REU students and a seminar for introducing the students to the large-scale team science approaches in microbiology research in the post-genome era.\n\n13.  A visit by the students to a company employing or targeting microbiological processes.\n\n \n\nThe program had a special component for developing leadership skills.  The students partly managed the enrichment activities. This participation allowed the students to take ownership of the program and provided inspiration for the science research profession.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\n \n\nThe students? research contributed to the knowledge in the field of microbiology which has applications in many areas including the practice of medicine, industrial production of food, feed, pharmaceuticals and fine and bulk chemicals, agriculture, waste treatment and bioremediation, and bioenergy production.\n\n \n\nThe program contributed to the development of trained professionals in the areas of biological and biochemical sciences, including microbiology.
