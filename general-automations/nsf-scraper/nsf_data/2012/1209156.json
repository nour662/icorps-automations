 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Nicholas DiRienzo of University of California, Davis to conduct a research project, entitled \"Hormonal regulation of personality in the field cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus,\" during the summer of 2012 at Hokkaido University in Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido.  The host scientist is Dr. Hitoshi Aonuma.\r\n\r\nMany animals exhibit personalities, defined as behavioral traits that are correlated across contexts.  Crickets possess bold and shy personalities, such that bold individuals are less cautious during potentially dangerous situations.  The consistency of these personalities suggests there is an underlying mechanism responsible for their expression.  Biogenic amines such as octopamine and serotonin can act as neurohormones when released into the hemolymph and have been shown to influence cricket aggression and escape behavior.  Differential regulation of biogenic amines could act as a regulatory mechanism underlying bold and shy personalities.  To investigate this, adult male field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) are being subjected to a boldness assay followed by an aggression assay to determine if the behavioral differences of bold and shy crickets are due to a difference in the amount of, or regulation of biogenic amine hormones.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            In nature, females often choose mating partners based on signals such as coloration, scent, or courtship song.  Females generally prefer males that have high-quality traits, such as bright coloration or loud courtship song, compared to those with low-quality traits, such as dull coloration or quiet song.  While much is known about female preference for male signals, little is known about the physiological mechanisms that are involved in the expression of female preference.  In other words, what physiological processes are involved between a female receiving a signal and subsequently expressing a preference?\n\n            In this study we investigated the role of biogenic amines, such as octopamine, serotonin, and tyramine, in modulating female preference in the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus.  Field crickets are a model organism for the study of female preference.  They behave naturally in laboratory conditions and readily respond to recorded playbacks of male calls.   Additionally, extensive research has been conducted as to the role of biogenic amines in regulating behavior.  Octopamine, serotonin, and tyramine have been shown to be involved in behaviors such as aggression, foraging, and dominant/subordinate relationships, as well as modulating general activity levels. \n\n            First, we measured if female brain biogenic amine levels responded to male calling song.  Females were isolated in a small glass beaker for a period of 30 minutes.  One group was exposed to male calling song while the other was not.  After the 30 minute period each female was dissected and its brain removed.   Biogenic amine levels were measured using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). The second component of this study involved measuring the relationship between female preference and brain biogenic amine levels.  Female preference was measured using a \"tama-kugel\" device.  The tama-kugel recorded the walking path of the female cricket in response to a playback of a male call.  We scored preference as the distance from the origin divided by the total path distance.  Thus, females who moved directly to the male call had a preference score close to one, while those that wandered more had a lower preference score.  Immediately after the trial we removed the female's brain, and then analyzed the hormone levels using HPLC-ECD.\n\n            Statistical analysis indicates that females who were exposed to calling song had higher dopamine levels than those who did not hear song.  Additionally, the ratio of biogenic amine to the associated catabolites were lower for those who were exposed to sound for all measured amines (octopamine, serotonin, dopamine, tyramine).  Together this indicates that brain biogenic amine levels do respond to male calling song.  In terms of preference, we found that the strength of preference influenced the levels of octopamine and tyramine found in the brain.  Generally, females with strong preferences had lower brain octopamine and tyramine levels after the trial, although this effect was size dependent. \n\n            This study is the first to show a relationship between female preference and a physiological mechanism.  The identification of such a mechanism lays the groundwork for future studies that will help clarify the hormone-preference relationship.   More broadly, this mechanism could help explain why females are sometimes constrained in their preferences.  For example, why females only respond to a narrow range of signals when a broader range exists.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicholas Dirienzo"
