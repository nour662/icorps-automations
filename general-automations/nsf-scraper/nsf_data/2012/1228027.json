 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Welch, Karla\r\nInstitution: University of Louisville\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: With an increase in the number of machines in daily life, there is a need for more intuitive systems that can interpret explicit as well as implicit, more subtle, means of communication. Since emotions and affective expressions play a role in decision-making, learning, and other cognitive functions, human interaction with technology, such as a computer or robot, will improve if affect recognition is part of that interaction. The design of affect-sensitive interactions between humans and technology, a research area known as affective computing, is an increasingly important discipline in the human-robot interaction community. This BRIGE proposal seeks to monitor physiological signals during interactive activities. This project will develop and test wireless, wearable sensors for use in an affect-sensitive adaptive system. The proposed system will make predictions about user's affective states and adapt the interaction to alter and improve user experience. Settings to be examined include games of varying difficulty utilizing an embodied robot and activities focused on teenagers with and without autism during periods of waiting (a likely stress-inducing activity for which external interceding feedback may help autistic individuals cope). The proposed system will allow the interaction to make alterations based on physiological data and inferred affective states to improve human-robot interaction and address social stressors. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The low-cost and highly deployable technologies developed in this proposal could have significant impact on making physiological signal monitoring more widely available. The results will support the investigation of closed-loop human-robot interaction tasks where the robot will implicitly sense human affective (i.e., emotional) states using affect recognition algorithms, and the robot can then alter its behavior to address specific human needs. They may also create completely new intervention strategies for children with autism. In addition, the educational and broadening participation objectives will engage high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in the design and research evaluation of advanced technologies for autism intervention, human-robot interaction, and affective computing. Efforts to reach out to underrepresented students cover two annual events that will showcase the ongoing research, and the planned experiments allow individuals with disabilities to engage in scientific research. The proposed work has potential to appeal to a wide range of students from electrical engineering, computer engineering, and bioengineering as well as experimental psychology and psychiatry; and findings in this area will address unanswered questions about affective computing.",

Five 3-in-1 sensors (i.e., a combined device to collect GSR, PPG, and SKT data) were produced and evaluated against commercial devices. The device collects data from the top side of a person&rsquo;s wrist, and is secured comfortably with a Velcro band. The housing was built by utilizing Louisville&rsquo;s FirstBuild (<a href=\"https://firstbuild.com/\">https://firstbuild.com/</a>) micro-factory on the campus of the University of Louisville. To improve the sampling speed, the sensor was connected to a Bluetooth dongle on a PC. With this approach, significantly better results were obtained. A transmission rate of 50Hz was found to be stable and gave results with less than 0.5% error.</p>\n<p>Additional work evaluated machine learning methods for affect recognition of participants. Working with data the PI had previously collected on six subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a research assistant created code to manipulate the kernel function of a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm until the best (i.e., highest percent accuracy) parameters were found for each subject, for each of three emotions. This method increased prediction accuracy over a previous method of using the radial basis function, a well-vetted kernel function for SVM, for all subjects. Manipulating the kernel functions and determining optimal parameters is not trivial; moreover, the result of increasing prediction accuracy, meaning a computer model could predict a subject&rsquo;s emotions over 80% of the time, is vital for creating intelligent systems that can add affect-sensitivity to human-robot interaction. A related human-robot interaction was developed to teach sight words, using an instructor on a computer and a robotic peer, to subjects with ASD and intellectual disabilities (ID), while monitoring their physiological signals to classify engagement. Individualized models of three students with ASD yielded an average 89% prediction rate when using physiological features, derived from the three physiological signals described above, to classify between engaged learning and quiet sitting.</p>\n<p>Affect-sensitive robot-based interactions were developed, with an emphasis on applications suitable for autism intervention. A complete system was developed to monitor the influence of robot interaction on the affective state of children, both with and without an autism diagnosis, while playing a computer game. Two scenarios were developed. In the first scenario, the robot reads out the score of the subject at the end of each trial and does not apologize if any delay occurs in the game. In the second scenario, the robot reads out the score of the subject at the end of each trial, uses some encouraging words to boost the morale of the subject, and apologizes whenever there is any delay in the game. While a subject is playing a game, he/she wears a 3-in1 sensor to collect physiological data.</p>\n<p>This work reached over 100 underrepresented students in summer programs. The PI presented portions of the work to INSPIRE (Increasing Student Preparedness and Interest in the Requisites for Engineering), a summer program with an emphasis on underrepresented students in engineering. One of the main goals of the presentation was to convey to the students a deeper understanding of want engineers do, using specific examples of the human-robot interaction and affective computing research. Exit surveys, adapted from the 2002 Ontario Society of Professional Engineers&rsquo; commissioned survey, were collected over three summers and supported that this goal was achieved. Five underrepresented students completed research projects in relation to this work. One student completed a PhD dissertation. Four students completed their Senior Capstone Design project.

This research was showcased for high-school students and teachers through UofL&rsquo;s annual Career Day for high school girls. The PI has witnessed how these activities build upon each other to increase participation in engineering. For example, one undergraduate the PI met during the annual female Undergraduate-Faculty Luncheon program later helped build a version of Oscar Torres&rsquo;s Jackoon robot (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqkM1GcR900\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqkM1GcR900</a>). This robot became a major part of the undergraduate enrichment course, &ldquo;Robot Interactions,&rdquo; developed under this project. At least one underrepresented student that took that course went on to major in ECE. The female student that helped build the robot was one of 20 students in Square&rsquo;s College Code Camp.
