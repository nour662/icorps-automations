 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\n\r\nObjective: This project seeks to formulate a clear and consistent interpretation of \r\noptical dynamics so that field interactions with matter can be confidently modeled in a \r\nmanner previously impossible. Such will enable educators to teach modern \r\nelectrodynamics with confidence and allow for the development of applications involving \r\nelectromagnetic fields. In pursuit of this goal, the specific aim of the proposed project is \r\nto answer, within the framework of classical electrodynamics, the questions ?how do we \r\nexpress with confidence the dynamics of complex material systems subject to \r\noptical/electromagnetic forces?? and ?how are the various models of electromagnetic \r\nforces and momentum interrelated?? This new interpretation will be applied to evaluate \r\nemerging and proposed technologies. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This research will provide the background necessary for modeling \r\ncomplex systems where electromagnetic fields are used for self-assembly and in situ \r\ncontrol of photonic structures and will additionally benefit biology and medicine where \r\noptical forces are currently used to probe the mechanical properties of living cells. \r\nApplications focus on efficient and sustainable use of resources and include the use of \r\noptical matter for fabricating nanophotonic structures for various applications. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This grant will assist in advancing technology developments in \r\nArkansas through a collaborative effort with other grants and contracts to build regional \r\ncenters of excellence, which will promote new innovation while encouraging small \r\nbusiness development. This work also proposes to improve how engineering education \r\ntreats field interactions with matter, an approach that will have a fundamental impact on \r\nthe preparedness of next generation engineers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe momentum of light in materials has been debated by scientists and engineers for more than a century.  The so-called Abraham-Minkowski controversy pertains to the issue of correctly identifying the stress, energy, and momentum model of electrodynamics so that experiments can be correctly modeled and applications can be confidently developed.  Researchers at Arkansas State University have, for the first time, developed a description of electrodynamics that is consistent with the pillars of modern physics including relativity and causality.  The model was developed with funding from the National Science Foundation and identifies a unique field-kinetic model of electrodynamics, which describes the stress, energy, and momentum of electromagnetic fields separate from material contributions, and a material dependent canonical model, which includes the coupled field and material systems.  The field-kinetic system combined field and material canonical system are able to better understand a number of applications where light is used as a tool to manipulate matter such as optical tweezers, optical binding, and stretching of biological materials, and they allow for detailed modeling of field material interactions in developing applications such as invisibility cloaking, microscopic tractor beams, and electromagnetic propulsion.\n\nUsing the theory of relativity, the Einstein-Laub and Abraham energy-momentum models have been disproved as physical descriptions of electrodynamics experiments.  This conclusion results because the models are not self-consistent descriptions of energy and momentum transfers in materials.  Additionally, the well-known Amperian formulation does not show consistency with microscopic force distributions within materials.  In contrast, the study proves that the Chu formulation of electrodynamics represents the field-kinetic model and allows the unique separation of field and material contributions.  The model is consistent with relativistic frame invariance principles, photon energy-momentum relationships (E/p = c), and microscopic force distributions in materials.  Additionally, the canonical momentum includes the material response and reduces to the well-known Minkowski model only when frequency dispersion is negligible.  Therefore, neither the Abraham nor the Minowski momenta are universally valid resolution of the Abraham-Minkowski debate.   \n\nTheoretical outcomes advanced by this project have been applied toward the development of potential applications such as design of a microscopic optical tractor beam on a chip, formation of electrostatically bound micro-particle systems, and an explanation of reversed radiation pressure in nanostructured materials.  First, the concept of microscopic surface particles being pulled toward the source of an optical waveguide has been analytically demonstrated.  The guided light can be tuned about a switching frequency to push or pull while also confining the particle to the surface of the waveguide.  Second, electrostatic control of micro-particles in inverted dielectric solution can result in stable, non-touching equilibria due to the combination of forces on the particles as well as the induced stress within the submerging fluid.  These equilibria have the potential to be controlled in-situ by externally applied electric fields for the formation of tunable materials and surfaces.  Finally, we have provided an analytical analysis demonstrating the reversal of momentum in nanoparticles and rods.  This previously explained phenomenon has the potential for producing enhanced and tunable optical forces on nanostructured materials for propulsion applications. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/13/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brandon Kemp"
