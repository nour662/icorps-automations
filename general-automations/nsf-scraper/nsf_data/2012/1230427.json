 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a robust, ultra-portable CO2 isotope ratio sensor. Typically, portable sensors cannot provide good sensitivity and accuracy. Sensors which do provide adequate sensitivity and accuracy are bulky, power hungry, high maintenance, and require a controlled operational environment. This is especially true for existing CO2 13/12C isotope ratio sensors, which require hundreds of watts of power.  Portable 13/12C sensors are critical to enable new applications including remote sensor network CO2 sequestration monitoring, environmental carbon cycle measurements, and medical breath analysis.  Novel technology using quantum cascade lasers and the latest compact optical cells can provide a compact, power efficient, sensitive, and accurate sensor platform for gas sensing.  The research objectives for this project aim to break the tradeoff between power consumption, sensitivity, complexity, and size. This project targets the development of a robust, field-deployable, outdoor sensor, and verifies its performance against existing methods of measuring CO2 isotope ratio. The realization of the final product will deliver a portable 13/12C isotope ratio laser spectrometer that operates in harsh environments using less than 15 Watts of power.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project deals with enhancing environmental monitoring by: 1) Enabling more precise measurements of carbon sources and sinks to improve climate science; 2) Providing a map of real-time carbon emission which is useful for research, policy, and education; 3) Providing real-time, long-term remote carbon measurements for carbon trading markets; 4) Enabling extremely sensitive leak detection of CO2 in carbon capture and sequestration applications without the significant cost of mobile laboratory infrastructure.  A more powerful set of gas sensors such as the ones developed through this project will dramatically lower the great expense currently required to precisely monitor greenhouse gases and air pollution, a critical global concern. Data generated by such carbon isotope ratio sensors will answer many critical questions related to the human impact of burning fossil fuels on the environment.  These types of sensors will also simultaneously impact industrial and medical fields, providing new solutions for industrial process control and safety, and portable real-time medical breath analyzers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Phase II SBIR project developed an advanced prototype sensor to measure carbon dioxide isotope ratios in the atmosphere using a technique called \"infrared laser absorption spectroscopy\".  We implemented and tested the sensor and compared the performance to previous technologies which can require room sized instruments.  We demonstrated the initial performance of our prototype ultra-portable shoebox-sized isotope ratio sensors which can run autonomously on batteries.  We also dramatically improved the performance of our novel optical multi-pass cell technology which allows us to have much higher sensitivity while keeping a similar sensor size.\n\nThe sensors we are developing for laser absorption spectroscopy will be able to detect a wide variety of chemicals in the atmosphere in a portable package, which will help society by: 1) enabling more precise measurements of carbon and pollution to improve environmental science; 2) lower the cost of monitoring chemicals in the air in remote locations; 3) Enabling extremely sensitive detection of chemicals for a wide variety of applications ranging from public safety to energy.  We successfully implemented a shoebox sized mid-infrared laser absorption spectrometer with all of the required equipment fully integrated.  By developing low power consumption, compact, sensor components, we can now produce precision chemical monitors using low cost optical configurations which are robust, and have the potential to survive in portable or outdoor year-round sensing applications. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen G So"
