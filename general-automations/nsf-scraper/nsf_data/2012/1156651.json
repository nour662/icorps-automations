The program consists of a preparation phase involving a one-hour course given over the winter to student participants, followed by ten weeks of summer research at either Wayne State University or Fermi National Laboratory (Batavia, IL) in topics including Astrophysics, Nuclear Physics, or Particle Physics. The one-hour course introduces the students to the physical, mathematical and computational concepts relevant for the summer experience. It includes a computer training homework and an ethics component. The participants then merge with other existing REU programs at each site for social activities and lectures on various scientific topics. Students are mentored by PhD researchers working on leading edge physics topics and/or technologies chosen for good mentorship qualities as well as their leadership in their respective scientific fields. Students are required to submit a report in the form of a paper at the end of their experience and deliver oral presentations.",
