While there are some sessions in professional organizations that address some aspects of sustainable nanotechnology, there is no one organization that is specifically aimed at this discipline that allows cross talk from the many disciplines involved.  This conference and organization will serve such an interdisciplinary role for professionals and young scholars to pursue research in sustainable nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\n\r\nThe conference will serve a role to promote discussion and collaboration focused on research and education in sustainable nanotechnology. This conference will address the critical aspects of sustainable nanotechnology such as life cycle assessment, green synthesis, green energy, industrial partnership, environmental and biological fate, transport, persistence, transformation, exposure assessment, recyclability, and the overall sustainability of engineered nanomaterials. Plenary lectures and keynotes will address issues such as the development of nanomaterials that, through their life cycle, properties and material efficiency, provide a framework for achieving more sustainable technologies, while optimizing performance. In principle, this involves the fundamental/applied research on the chemistry of producing new green nanomaterials; eco-manufacturing processing of nanomaterials and products. Other aspects include, life-cycle performance; modeling and theoretical analyses of materials and their structures in nanomedicine, energy and industrial applications, and life-cycle cost and economic impacts in real life practice. The use of nanomaterials to alleviate adverse consequences from green house effect, exhaustion or abundance of natural resources, and environmental impacts due to the use of nondecomposable materials/composites are also considered appropriate. Special focus will be given to toxicity, transformation and the interactions with the biological system. Hence the conference objectives are to:\r\n(i) Bring together scientific experts from academia, industries, and government agencies from around the world to present and discuss current research findings on the subject of sustainability of nanotechnology.\r\n(ii) Foster new collaboration between academic and industrial participants for a better understanding of the challenges associated with the sustainability of nanotechnology and\r\n(iii) Initiate the formation of a non-profit, worldwide professional society known as Sustainable Nanotechnology Organization(SNO) \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nThe sustainable nanotechnology conference will draw attention to the use of nanomaterials to alleviate adverse consequences from green house effect, exhaustion or abundance of natural resources, and environmental impacts due to the use of non-decomposable  materials/composites. It is anticipated that 250 industrial partners, materials scientists, government stakeholders, physical and social scientists, engineers, and toxicologists, will present recent research. The relatively small group of participants will be ideal to promote vigorous discussion and close interchange of ideas. The conference will attract between up to 25 participants who are junior scholars (doctoral and postdoctoral students).Thus the conference will provide networking opportunities for scientists at different career stages. The two and half day schedule will foster interactions between young investigators and more established researchers. There are few if any similar conferences in the broad topic of Sustainable Nanotechnology, enhancing the importance of this event to new investigators. In addition, several scientists from underrepresented groups in science will play key roles in the conference. Participants of the Sustainable Nanotechnology conference will come from not only the US but around the globe, ensuring a diverse and expert group to facilitate stimulating  discussions.",
