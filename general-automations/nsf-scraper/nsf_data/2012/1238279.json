This set of activities builds on the extensive experience of the three PIs in conducting workshops in their discipline (economics, social sciences, and geosciences). The project is leveraging the expertise and capacity of the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) at Carleton College. SERC is a resource that provides expert technical support for web-based instructional materials and improved undergraduate STEM education.",

Despite such progress, participants noted a range of barriers in implementing their action plans. In particular, professional association culture, rules, dues structures, meeting location and fees continued to hamper outreach to community college faculty. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/18/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark H Maier"
