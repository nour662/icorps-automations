 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to further develop the study of central configurations, an important and active sub-field of celestial mechanics. A central configuration is a special set of positions where the force on each body due to gravity points in the opposite direction of that body's position vector (with respect to the center of mass).  Finding a central configuration involves solving a complicated system of nonlinear algebraic equations.  Central configurations are important since they lead to families of homographic and homothetic solutions in both the N-body and N-vortex problems.  Specific aims of the project include classifying five-body co-circular central configurations, studying relative equilibria in the four and five-vortex problems, using symmetry to simplify the study of central configurations for special choices of the masses, analyzing the linear stability of the corresponding relative equilibria, and describing certain symmetric families of solutions. These topics will be explored using a combination of analysis and modern and computational algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\nThe N-body problem concerns the motion of celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, even spaceships) interacting under their mutual gravitational attraction. Although inherently a mathematical discipline, applications to astronomy and spacecraft transport are plentiful.  For example, the recent astronomical discovery of an asteroid at a ``Trojan point'' in the Earth-Sun system came centuries after the mathematical work of Lagrange on three-body central configurations.  The N-vortex problem is a widely used model for understanding vorticity evolution in fluid dynamics. Some of the most important types of solutions in these problems are periodic in nature, returning to their initial configuration after some fixed amount of time.  Among this class of solutions are simple, rigidly rotating orbits, known as relative equilibria, where the size and shape of the configuration is unchanged throughout the motion.  Locating a relative equilibrium requires first finding a central configuration. Analyzing the structure and stability of relative equilibria leads to a greater understanding of the complexities in the full problem.  In celestial mechanics this study is useful for plotting spacecraft trajectories and for discovering inexpensive methods of exploring space. In addition, locating stable solutions provides key information about the orbits astronomers and other researchers expect to see in the universe. An important priority of the project is to mentor, support and collaborate with undergraduate researchers interested in the field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has improved our understanding of the underlying mathematical properties in two physical settings:  the motion of celestial bodies (i.e., the n-body problem) and the motion of point vortices in fluid dynamics (i.e, the planar n-vortex problem).  Each system can be described by a set of differential equations that while complicated, also contains some specific structure.  In both cases, special periodic solutions called relative equilibria were investigated.  A relative equilibrium is a rigidly rotating configuration of bodies (or vortices) that returns to its original position infinitely often.  Real world examples include the celestial orbits of the Sun, Jupiter, and the Trojan asteroids (always forming an equilateral triangle in our solar system), and the rotating eyewalls observed in numerical simulations of hurricanes (often polygonal in shape).  Studying relative equilibria is an important approach to understanding the behavior of other orbits in these difficult problems.\n\nThe existence and stability of relative equilibria was investigated and proven mathematically for certain choices of circulations (vortex strengths) in the n-vortex problem.  For example, given four vortices with two equal-strength pairs, a complete classification of the number and type of relative equilibria solutions was achieved, with a focus on the shape and symmetry of the configuration.  Solutions in the shape of a trapezoid, a rhombus, and a kite were discovered.  Some solutions have one vortex lying inside the triangle formed by the outer three (see attached image).  Moreover, the stability of many of these solutions was determined rigorously.  Stable solutions are ones we might expect to see in the real world setting.  Some simulations of hurricanes have exhibited a rotating four-vortex configuration reminiscent of the stable rhombus solution discovered in this project.\n\nOne important result of the project was a connection drawn between the stability of a relative equilibrium in the n-vortex problem and the type of critical point determined by the initial configuration of vortices.  In calculus, we learn how to find and describe critical points of functions, a concept with important applications (e.g., minimizing a cost function to keep prices down).  In the vortex setting, assuming that all of the vortices are rotating in the same direction, we prove that minima of the Hamiltonian function (the key function that captures the dynamics of the system), are precisely the stable relative equilibria.  This improves our understanding of which relative equilibrium configurations are stable and why.  It also suggests some simple numerical approaches for finding stable examples and helps explain their persistence in simulations of fluid flow.\n\nA final outcome of this project was the support and development of five undergraduate researchers who were mentored by the Principal Investigator.  As a result of their research experience, these students learned to formulate suitable research questions, to investigate those questions using numerical and analytic techniques, and to understand and utilize relevant work of other researchers.  Each student gained experience in using computer software to help conduct their research.  In addition, they had the opportunity to share their work at local and national research conferences. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gareth E Roberts"
