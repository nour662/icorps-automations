The program is serving 15 undergraduate and graduate students per year and provides leveraged scholarship support, a cohort of students focused on engineering research initiatives, integrated one-on-one faculty and industry mentoring, industry driven research topics and coursework that will produce graduates with both Bachelor and Master degrees in 5.5 years. The program addresses industrial needs using an innovative company-sponsored work experience that improves the way students and faculty interact with industry and the way industry perceives Engineers with advanced degrees.",
