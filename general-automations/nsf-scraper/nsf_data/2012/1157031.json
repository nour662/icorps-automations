REU students will follow a program that allows them to conduct field research, analyze samples on state-of-the-art instrumentation, interact with graduate students and faculty in multiple departments to interpret the results, present the results at a campus-wide poster session and then at a national professional meeting, and participate in seminars on research ethics, global change science topics, and the science-policy interface.",

We were particularly successful in attracting a geographically and ethnically diverse cohort of REU fellows for summer 2014.\n\n Real advancements in global change science require a non-traditional, interdisciplinary approach that integrate basic sciences such as geology, hydrology, and ecology, with applied and social sciences such as urban ecology, engineering, and policy.
