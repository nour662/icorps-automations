 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bio-mediated soil improvement, and in particular the use of microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) as a natural bio-mediated cementation process for sand improvement, has progressed rapidly. We propose to directly address the critical issues of treatment uniformity & verification, bio-stimulation, and by-product management through modest field-scale trials that are supported by experimental and numerical modeling techniques.  Specifically, we proposed to perform two field-scale trials in a deep test chamber using natural liquefiable sand.  The first trial relies on bio-augmentation (injection of bacteria) in order to provide a low-risk ground-truth set of data unencumbered by the unknown spatial distribution of native bacteria that we face with bio-stimulation. This first experiment builds directly on extensive laboratory research, has high likelihood of success and thus will enable focus on treatment uniformity and verification using in-situ and laboratory geotechnical tests. The second trial will use bio-stimulation (activation of native sessile bacteria) that introduces the additional degree of freedom (spatial distribution of bacteria) but is also the most desirable field scale treatment approach for the future.  It is more practical (cost, permitting), has reduced by-product generation, and may increase uniformity.  Both trials will enable study of by-product generation during treatment and its fate after soil improvement. We believe that field-scale treatment in a large test chamber provides the necessary balance between length scale and experimental control to rigorously, but practically, address these issues. The full-scale work will be supported by parallel efforts developing a robust bio-stimulation technique and modeling of the field trials to develop a predictive modeling tool that accounts for bio-stimulation, by-product transport and fate, and spatial heterogeneity.  The scope builds on the team?s continued research activities over the past eight years, making this a challenging, yet feasible, scope.  We envision that successful completion of this project will be transformative through improvement in treatment uniformity, validation of verification tests, development of a bio-stimulation approach, and management by-product generation and fate. \r\n\r\nBio-mediated soil improvement is a relatively new, novel technique for improving the engineering properties of soils to a level where civil infrastructure can be supported.  In particular, microbially induced calcite precipitation, or MICP, is a process in which microbial activity in the soil temporarily modifies local environmental conditions such that calcite crystals bind soil particles together.  In the laboratory loose, liquefiable sand can be transformed into sandstone-like material in a matter of days.  MICP is also attractive in that it uses less energy, and may be more sustainable than existing technologies using man-made chemicals.  This research project is up-scaling the technology towards full-scale field deployment.  Focus is placed on particular issues that directly influence the cost, environmental impact, sustainability, uniformity, and permanence.  These issues include stimulation and utilization of naturally existing soil bacteria, optimization of treatment formulation, and optimization of the physical injection technique.  This will be studied through a combination of numerical and experiment work across length scales from about 10 cm up to 5 m.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBio-mediated calcite precipitation, or biocementation, is a natural biomediated process in which bacteria are used to solidify sand.  This is a unique, innovative, and sustainable approach to stabilize loose sandy soils that are susceptible to liquefaction, contain heavy metal contaminants, or are too weak to support infrastructure.  The research for this particular grant focused on developing a technique to stimulate pre-existing bacteria to assist in the biocementation process, learning how to better spatially and temporally control the biocementation process, and developing techniques to assess the extent to which soils have been improved by the biocementation process. \n\n \n\nThe research work used experimental and numerical tools, ranging from genetic sequencing of bacteria, to cone penetrometer measurements, to chemical tests of the pore fluid, to 2D numerical simulations in order to research the above objectives.  Two large tank experiments were the focal point of the research.  Biocementation was achieved in one tank by injecting bacteria know to be effective at performing biocementation.  In the second tank naturally existing soil bacteria were stimulated and then used to perform the biocementation.  Measurements at the end of the tests showed that the cementation achieved in the two tanks was practically identical.  This proved that the biostimulation technique can be as effective as the bioaugmentation technique. \n\n \n\nMicrobial and genetic analysis of samples obtained from both tanks verified that the bacteria species stimulated in the biostimulation tank were distinctly different from the bacteria injected in the bioaugmentation tank.  This confirmed that biostimulation had indeed occurred.  Further, it was determined that the bacteria active in the bioaugmentation tank after the treatment process were not the same bacteria that were injected initially; the process of biocementation had naturally stimulated the native bacteria over time.\n\n \n\nMeasurements of shear wave velocity (Vs), calcite content, and cone penetration resistance measurements (qc) collectively showed that the qc measurement is not particularly sensitive to cementation, either natural or biocementation induced, until the shear wave velocity has been increased to more than about 300 m/s.  Shear wave velocity measurements were shown to be more sensitive, and therefore preferable, for detecting or monitoring cementation processes in sands. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason T Dejong"
