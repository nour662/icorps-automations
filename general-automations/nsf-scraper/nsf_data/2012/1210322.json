 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some of the most spectacular traits in nature are ornaments used by members of one sex in competition for access to mates or fertilization opportunities. Of particular interest is the process by which mating preferences and sexually-selected ornaments evolve in tandem. There are many models describing the various conditions determining how these traits evolve together, but all of them rest on assumptions that have never been theoretically tested. The genes controlling the ornament and genes controlling the mating preference have always been assumed to be inherited in a manner that maintains a constant genetic architecture. The goal of this study is to explore the dynamics of ornament-preference joint evolution when the genetic architecture itself is allowed to evolve. Individual-based simulation models will be used to explore regions of parameter space that facilitate or hinder the rapid evolution of mating preferences and ornaments predicted by long-standing theory. The results of this project will provide a better understanding of the evolution of genetically correlated traits in general. Moreover, the simulation models will be useful for the demonstration of evolutionary processes to students and will help to communicate to the public how computer models can be used to dissect complex natural processes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne interesting feature of most animals, including humans, is that they have preferences for certain traits in their prospective mates.  Much research has been devoted to understanding why organisms show these mating preferences.  Theoretical treatments indicate that a wide variety of phenomena could explain the origin and elaboration of mating preferences.  One possibility is that male traits become genetically correlated with female preferences, resulting in a runaway process, where both traits and preferences become more and more elaborate over time.  In this project, we developed computer models of this \"runaway process\" to study the buildup of genetic correlations in populations with mating preferences.  Our results show that genetic correlations between traits and preferences tend to be weak, even when mate choice is strong.  However, even these weak preferences can cause runaway sexual selection.  In addition, we found this sort of runaway sexual selection to occur across a wide range of conditions, and we found that genetic drift (random changes in the genetic constitution of a population) is enough in most cases to initiate a runaway process.  These results exemplify a new individual-based modeling approach for the study of mating preferences and extend our understanding of how mating preferences originate in nature.  This award also trained a graduate student in computational biology and resulted in a document that outlines how to write individual-based simulations in the C++ programming language.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adam G Jones"
