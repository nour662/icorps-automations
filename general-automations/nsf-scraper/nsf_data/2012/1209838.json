 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Anna Michelle Wright of Wayne State University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Are people from different cultures more willing to replace their memories with technology?\" during the summer of 2012 at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea.  The host scientist is Dr. Incheol Choi.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is multifaceted. This research project is the first laboratory examination of the effect of video camera presence on later recall of events. Specifically, this research project examines whether individuals who are confident they can refer back to a video recording of an event distribute that information into the environment (i.e., recall less information than individuals who believe the video recording to be unreliable or unavailable). Completion of this research project in South Korea allows the researchers to examine a memory \"off-loading\" effect in a cross-cultural setting. As such, the study provides information about the generality of mechanisms of human memory and human cognition. \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
