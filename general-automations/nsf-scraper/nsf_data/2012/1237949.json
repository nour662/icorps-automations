The approach is based on understanding the fundamental issues for piezoelectrics at the system integration level by focusing on fabrication yield, reliability, and reproducibility of the proposed microdevices. The frequency of operation of the resonators will be increased up to 6 GHz and recently developed microswitches will be integrated in the same process and optimized for low voltage actuation.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe large scale integration of piezoelectric micromechanical devices will have a transformational impact on future radio front-ends. New low power radio architectures that take advantage of frequency hopping and channel selection will be enabled by this integration. Fundamental challenges related to device design, impedance characterization and Q limits will be explored at unreported frequencies of operation. The fundamental issues of piezoelectrics concerning material orientation, electromechanical coupling, residual stresses and transducer modeling will be examined and their understanding permit a significant leap forward in the use of these films. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe research activities will promote notable advancements in the area of wireless communications and sensing by making possible the realization of multi-standard and reconfigurable devices.  The discoveries and technology development performed under this project will be disseminated by including the findings in a newly created course, REU programs, and offering tours and hands-on training sessions to K-12 students and underrepresented minority in the Philadelphia school district.\r\n\r\n",
