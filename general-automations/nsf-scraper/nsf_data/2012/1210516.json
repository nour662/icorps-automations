 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how the fate of carbon is influenced by biological communities is one of the greatest challenges in ecosystem science. Freshwater ecosystems, including streams, are now recognized as sites for the transport, processing, and burial of substantial amounts of organic matter. Communities of microbes, including bacteria, account for a vast majority of the processing of organic matter in streams, but there is much that is not known about how microbial communities impact the fate of organic matter in streams. This project will address this knowledge gap by studying how bacterial community diversity, stream water chemistry, and organic matter composition influence whether organic matter is consumed by stream microbes or transported downstream. A mesocosm experiment will be conducted to test the hypothesis that changes in pH and organic matter composition will impact the stream microbial community and its ability to process organic matter. Genetic bacterial community fingerprints will be used to quantify how the bacterial community responds to the experimental treatments.  Bacterial metabolic responses will be measured using enzyme assays and overall metabolic rates.\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to understanding of the relationship between microbial community structure and metabolism in freshwaters.  As watersheds are altered by human activity, pH and organic matter inputs to aquatic ecosystems are also changing. Since streams may be viewed as sentinels for environmental change, this study will generate insight into the response of freshwater communities to global change. Undergraduate researchers will be engaged in all aspects of the work to further their scientific understanding. Results will be communicated at scientific meetings and in journals. Educational materials will be developed for local primary school students that assist in interpreting this work and broader concepts of ecosystem ecology.",
