MIGHTY is a long-running conference series which draws graph theorists from across the country to one- or two-day conferences to disseminate new ideas in a wide variety of topics related to graph theory.  Topics typically represented include chromatic graph theory, directed graphs, hypergraphs, and applications of graph theory (i.e., to biological and social networks).\r\n\r\nThis conference provides a rare opportunity to bring together a large number of researchers in graph theory from the Midwest.  The broad appeal of the plenary speakers, Ron Graham and Persi Diaconis, will attract many participants including students and junior investigators.  Most of the funds from this award will support the travel costs of such participants.  More information about the conference is available at the conference website:  http://www.math.iastate.edu/mighty2012/.",

To help achieve this goal there were a series of informal times put into the program.

The banquet lasted several hours and gave the participants ample opportunity to talk and mingle with other participants.\n\nPARTICIPATION\n\nThe conference registration was open to all and the conference was promoted by direct contact to many graph theory researchers in the midwest region and Iowa, on mailing lists, on conference lists, and during several conferences leading up to MIGHTY LIII.  This led to a sizable conference in terms of participation resulting in a conference that was more than twice as large as any previous MIGHTY conference in the series.\n\nThere were 155 participants who registered from the conference, and several local individuals who did not register but still attended.  Of these 42 were from Iowa State University including a large number of graduate students and professors from departments outside of mathematics.  Information about nationality of participants was not collected, however all but two of the participants were associated with either a college or university in the United States or directly with the U.S.\\ government.\n\nThere were undergraduate participants from Iowa State University, Drake University, St. Olaf College (who brought 9 students), and several other schools.  We worked with several programs with strengths in graph theory to bring in their graduate students to participate, these schools included University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Wyoming, Univer..."
