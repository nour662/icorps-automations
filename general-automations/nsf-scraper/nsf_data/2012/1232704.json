 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many empirical studies of hydrothermal vent systems on the seafloor and an increasing number of biogeochemical studies are being carried out to look at various mineralogical and biological processes using unconventional stable isotopes (i.e., those of heavy elements such as iron, zinc, copper, and sulfur). To allow quantitative and predictive results of these empirical studies, fractionation factors of these isotopes must be known.  However, at present, no experimental work to derive these coefficients and parameters have been carried out.  This research builds off a one-year proof-of-concept study to show that fractionation occurs in these systems in a systematic way. The new project examines the effects of temperature, fluid chemistry, and reaction rate on the fractionation of non-traditional stable isotopes (Fe, Cu, Zn, S) between sulfide minerals and fluids at elevated temperatures and pressures. The work will include phase separation experiments to assess the role of fluid chemistry on non-traditional stable isotope fractionation between vapor and brine. It will use isotope tracers in equilibrium experiments to look at reaction progress and to see how isotope systematics respond to reaction rates and mechanisms. Sulfur isotope exchange for homogeneous and heterogeneous systems will also be tested experimentally. Broader impacts of the work include building fundamental infrastructure for science via the development of kinetic and fractionation factors that are essential for the development of theoretical models for predicting stabilities of minerals containing Fe, Cu, Zn, and S. Impacts also include the engagement of graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art experimental studies of water-rock interaction and the involvement of an early career PI from an institution in an EPSCOR State (Louisiana).",

In the absence of data to calibrate the variability (fractionation), however, it is not possible to use the observed isotopic patterns in natural systems to constrain conditions of sulfide mineral formation, nor to assess how this might affect broader aspects of the geochemical cycles of metal isotopes in the Earth&rsquo;s ocean and underlying ocean crust. Thus, the goals of this project involved experimental determination of the effect of chemical and physical factors on the fractionation of non-traditional metal isotopes and sulfur between fluids and sulfide minerals. Sulfide minerals, such as pyrite and chalcopyrite, were emphasized in the study, since these minerals are the dominant sulfur-bearing alteration minerals found in virtually all natural hydrothermal systems, but especially at deep sea vents. The experimental design and strategy benefited from the development and application of flexible cell hydrothermal equipment (Fig. 1). An important aspect of this experimental approach is that fluids and minerals (Fig. 2) can be equilibrated at a wide range of temperatures and pressures, during which minerals recrystallize and exchange metal and sulfur isotopes with the fluid. In the course of our research, the use of anomalous isotopic spikes (isotopic composition of fluid components very different than found in nature) was perfected as a means to determine the rates of isotope exchange and approach to equilibrium. This, together with other aspects of our experimental design provides other researchers with a new experimental approach that can be used to assess rates of reaction in compositionally different chemical systems, enhancing research infrastructure and satisfying NSF broader impact criteria.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The experimental data were tested on sulfide minerals and hydrothermal fluids from seafloor hydrothermal vent environments (Fig. 3).&nbsp; These data show that minerals such as pyrite do not precipitate from solution, but form from FeS precursors, and that times scales on the order of 10,000 hours are required to achieve equilibrium, even at temperatures as high as 350&deg;C.
