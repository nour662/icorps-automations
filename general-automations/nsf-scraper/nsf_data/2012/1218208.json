 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the internet and mobile devices become increasingly important\r\nparts of our society, the need for web and mobile applications has\r\ngrown. Recent advances in software frameworks have drastically\r\nreduced the amount of code needed to develop such applications. From a\r\nprogramming languages perspective, the key enabling technology is\r\nreflection, that is, the ability of a program to introspect and to\r\nmodify itself. Unfortunately, reflection comes at a heavy cost:\r\nit can delay the detection of bugs, it reduces the effectiveness of\r\nbug-finding tools, and it reduces the speed of applications. The\r\ngoal of this research project is to preserve the benefits of\r\nreflection while eliminating the disadvantages, thereby improving the\r\nreliability and speed of web and mobile applications.\r\n\r\nThe key observation that underlies this research is that uses of\r\nreflection in software frameworks are governed by implicit\r\nconventions. If those conventions could be made explicit, then\r\nautomated software tools will be able to effectively reason about\r\nreflective code. This research will create a rich specification\r\nlanguage for making those conventions explicit, it will investigate\r\nalgorithms for inferring specifications from existing \r\napplication code, and it will develop tools for checking the\r\nconformance of web-mobile applications and frameworks with respect to \r\nspecifications.",
