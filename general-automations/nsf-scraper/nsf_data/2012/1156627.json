 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to West Virginia University that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2012- 2013. West Virginia University has about 20 faculty who will serve as mentors. Participants have opportunities for research training in ecology, environmental biology, geography, molecular biology or genomics. Upon completion of the REU program, students will be better prepared for future opportunities as graduate students and researchers in environmental biology and ecology. Students are expected to do full-time research, as well as participate in seminars and various workshops, such as the responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities and the graduate school application process. At the end of the 10-week program, all REU students will present their research during a poster session that is similar in many aspects to poster presentations at scientific meetings. REU participants will have access to a rich array of individual mentor?s facilities, as well as many interdepartmental labs with core facilities, such the WVU Core Genomics facility. The program's recruitment effort consists primarily of digital-based advertising, including using directed emails to faculty at regional colleges and universities teaching in related fields. The program is open to all undergraduate students enrolled in biology, geography, plant science or related fields. Participants must be a rising junior or senior, and students are selected based on academic record and potential for outstanding research in environmental biology and ecology. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://biology.wvu.edu/nsf-reu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Thomas at rthomas@wvu.edu).",
