 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (TAMU-CC), a Hispanic-Serving Institution, with the support of area community colleges who have high enrollments of minority and female students, is providing scholarships to academically talented and financially needy community college students transferring into computer science, engineering, and mathematics majors at TAMU-CC, to allow them to complete a baccalaureate degree. \"Expanding the STEM Pool with Transfer Scholarships\" (ESP) is recruiting twenty-six college students from regional community colleges with large Hispanic student populations as ESP Scholars. The five-year project is a recruitment tool providing each ESP Scholar up to three years of funding, which may be augmented by other scholarships and financial aid.  The project is retaining scholars through a learning-community cohort experience within an existing infrastructure of student services (mentoring, academic advising, research opportunities, career counseling, professional development) augmented by support services tailored for transfer students, such as an orientation course designed to alleviate transfer shock.  At least twenty-six graduates with B.S. degrees in computer science, engineering, and mathematics are being produced, many from underrepresented groups, thereby increasing the diversity of the nation's professional workforce in these critical fields.  All students are being encouraged to continue to graduate school by leveraging NSF LSAMP and other undergraduate research programs.  Some may pursue doctoral degrees and serve as role models for future Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students.",

Retention efforts focused on creating a cohort of scholars and provide mentoring and research opportunities to the scholars.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe ESP project provided 145 semesters of scholarships to a total of 34 students.  These scholarships helped students focus on their academics and along with project efforts to retain the students had a huge impact on their success.  16 of the 34 students graduated with a STEM degree. Of the remaining 18 students, 16 are still progressing towards degrees at TAMUCC, although 2 of those in a non-STEM major.  The remining two students left TAMUCC without a degree. The students were of 5 majors: 17 Computer Science, 2 Electrical Engineering, 1 Geographic Information Science, 3 Mathematics, and 11 Mechanical Engineering.\n\nOverall, 47.1% of ESP scholars graduated and another 47.1% are still actively seeking a degree (although 5.8% of those are in a non-STEM area).  Only 5.8% left the university.  Overall, only 11.6% either left the university and 88.4% either graduated or are still seeking a degree.   This is much better than all other transfer students from the same majors during the same period.  For the non-ESP transfer students, 20.5% graduated, 41.1% are still seeking a degree and 38.4% left the university.  The ESP scholars were 1.5% more likely to have either graduated or still be seeking a degree, and non-ESP students were 6.5 times more likely to leave TAMUCC. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe ESP program was made up of a diverse group of students.  19 of the 34 scholars reported as either female or from an underrepresented minority (10 were both) and 10 of the 34 reported as being the first-generation from their families to go to college.  Of the 16 ESP scholars that graduated, 6 reported as being from an underrepresented minority or female (2 were both).  The percentages of underrepresented minorities and females in the majors are much higher than national average increasing the diversity of professionals in the workforce in these critical fields, helping close the gap and to fill the shortages of qualified professionals.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott A King"
