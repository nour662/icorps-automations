The tandem of inverse and control problems for partial differential equations constitutes a rapidly growing area of mathematics. In addition to its important theoretical component, it also has significant impact in applied science and engineering, including applications to stabilization, identification and design of physical systems (e.g., quantum control), image processing, mathematical finance, astronomy, geosciences, medical imaging and nondestructive evaluation of materials, among many others. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
