 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Trustworthy Scientific Cyberinfrastructure (CTSC) will transform and improve the practice of cybersecurity and hence trustworthiness of NSF scientific cyberinfrastructure. CTSC will provide readily available cybersecurity expertise and services, as well as leadership and coordination across a broad range of NSF scientific cyberinfrastructure projects via a series of engagements with NSF cyberinfrastructure projects and a broader ongoing education, outreach and training effort. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  CTSC will advance the state of cybersecurity practice across the community by analyzing gaps in cybersecurity technology to provide guidance to researchers and developers, addressing the application of software assessment to complicated cyberinfrastructure software stacks, and fostering broadly the transition of cybersecurity research to practice. Broader Impact: Scientific computing and confidence in its results relies on trustworthy cyberinfrastructure. The CTSC mission is to help provide the trustworthy cyberinfrastructure that science requires across the ecosystem of NSF. CTSC's work will impact science through dozens of cyberinfrastructure projects over the project's lifetime. Additionally, CTSC will perform workforce development in the area of cyberinfrastructure cybersecurity through EOT activities: training, undergraduate curriculum development, and student education.",
