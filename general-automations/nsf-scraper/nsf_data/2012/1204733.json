  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlgebraic geometry is the study of the geometry of the solution sets to systems\nof polynomial equations in several variables.  One can ask many question about\nsuch solution sets.  For example, if p(x,y,z) is a cubic polynomial, does the\nset of points where p(x,y,z) = 0 contain any lines?  If so, how many?  This\nclassical problem has been solved for a long time.  However, the field of\nalgebraic geometry is very much alive and people are discovering beautiful new\nresults all the time.\n\nThe solution set to a system of polynomial equations is called an algebraic\nvariety.  The circle defined by x^2 + y^2 = 1 is a good example to keep in mind.\nAt each point on the circle, there is a tangent line.  There is a new object \nwhich consists of pairs of a point p on the circle, and a point on the tangent \nline at p.  This is an example of a structure called a vector bundle.  The study\nof vector bundles on an algebraic variety can give deep insight into its \ngeometry.\n \nOne line of inquiry I pursued with M. Brown has to do with special vector      \nbundles called tilting bundles.  It is not so important to know exactly what a\ntilting bundle is, but rather that it may be connected with a fundamental \nproperty of algebraic varieties called rationality.  Sometimes it is possible to\ndescribe the vicinity of a point on an algebraic variety using a coordinate \nsystem which is also algebraic.  For example, if you were to take the point \n(1,0) on the circle and join it to any point on the x-axis by a line, the line \nwould meet the circle in exactly one other point.  If you were to solve for the \ncoordinates of this point in terms of the x-coordinate of the point on the\nx-axis, you would get ratios of polynomials.  This means that the circle is\nrational.  (However, y^2 = x(x+1)(x+2) is not rational!)  Dr. Brown and I\ninvestigated whether or not the existence of a tilting bundle on an algebraic\nvariety implies the variety is rational and found that the answer is yes in some\ncases.  Our work clarifies this exciting connection, but there is still much\nwork to be done.\n\nAnother line of inquiry, followed with R. Kulkarni and Y. Mustopa, also has to do\nwith vector bundles.  We studied a special class of vector bundles called Ulrich\nbundles.  Again, it is not so crucial to understand what an Ulrich bundle is to \nget the point of the project.  Any variety which has an Ulrich bundle also has a\nhandful of other exciting properties that tend to be difficult to understand on\ntheir own.  Our contribution was to expand the tools available to researchers \nstudying Ulrich bundles and to stress-test some new techniques.  In particular,\nwe show that it is possible to reduce a problem about Ulrich bundles on a \nhigh-dimensional variety to a problem about one-dimensional varieties.\n\nFinally, in joint work with D. Halpern-Leistner we studied an exotic form of\nsymmetry of algebraic varieties that is related to string theory.  We were able\nto understand the structure of those symmetries that arise from a construction\nfirst detailed by string theorists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/18/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ian Shipman"
