 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aluminum and its alloys continue to be among the most important materials in use today. Aluminum in involved in various systems to enhance efficiency and material conservation in applications as diverse as transportation, electrical power transmission, electronic packaging, building and construction. NSF funds are requested for partial support of the 13th International Conference on Aluminum Alloys (ICAA-13), to be held June 3 to 7, 2012, at Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU), Pittsburgh, PA. This conference is a specialty conference on Aluminum and its alloys, which is organized by the ICAA International Committee. The technical program consists of ten sessions covering a wide range of topics, which describe scientific breakthroughs in computational modeling, processing techniques, recycling technologies, and the production of novel materials with promising combinations of properties and economic viability. ICAA-13 will bring together researchers from the industrial, national, and university communities, both experimental and theoretical, to discuss the latest scientific and technological developments, as well as the future of aluminum. More than 420 abstracts have been received from researchers worldwide, representing a number of countries across the continents of North and South America, Asia, Europe, and Australia. This conference will cover the most critical and strongly growing subject areas in aluminum materials science. The funding is requested to provide domestic travel and registration for students and postdoctoral researchers, and registrations for several young faculty members. Support is provided by three NSF Programs: Metals and Metallic Nanostructures, Materials and Surface Engineering and Condensed Matter and Materials Theory.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe broader impacts from the NSF support were mainly that we had funds to attract young researchers to the meeting.  Since the conference rotates between the major continents (e.g. ICAA-12 was in Japan and ICAA-14 will be in Norway) then holding it in North America was a once-in-a-decade opportunity to bring together the leading researchers and industry practitioners in this field.  Aluminum, as noted elsewhere, is the most significant metallic system after steel.  It is increasingly important in car manufacturing as the car companies have to reduce vehicle weight to meet fuel efficiency and emissions standards.  To aid in attracting student interest, the PI contacted colleagues at minority serving institutions to solicit interest in sending students and postdocs from under-represented minorities.  Three faculty from under-represented groups were supported to attend the meeting, along with six graduate students.  Of the more than four hundred attendees, roughly equal numbers came from Europe, the Americas and from Asia, along with two from Africa.  Ten technical symposia were held on topics including Solidification and Casting, Phase Transformations, Thermo-mechanical treatment, Corrosion, Coating and Surfaces, Fatigue and Fracture toughness, Forming and Joining, Recycling, Advanced Analysis, Integrated Computational Metallurgical Engineering, and Novel materials.  There was no research associated with this grant and therefore no scientific findings are reported here.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/19/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anthony D Rollett"
