 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are 429 ant genera known to science, but over 10% of ant species belong to the single 'hyperdiverse' genus Pheidole.  Likewise, certain geographic areas (e.g. New Guinea) are diverse in species, phenotypes, and ecological strategies while others (e.g. Samoa) are depauperate.  These patterns represent a puzzle for biologists. This project investigates the macroevolutionary dynamics of Pheidole lineages in the island systems of the Indo-Pacific.  The approach uses DNA to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Pheidole, establishing when and where different species, phenotypes, and ecological strategies evolved.  Using statistical and theoretical methods, this information will be used to test hypotheses for the forces shaping biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses a fundamental question of biology; whether the course of evolution and the biodiversity patterns we observe are inevitable or the outcomes of random chance. Addressing this question is a necessary step toward predicting the future dynamics of ecosystems in this time of unprecedented change. This is especially true for ants, one of the most ubiquitous and ecologically dominant animal groups on the planet.  In the modern era, 'invasive' ants are now being transferred around the globe by humans and are causing damage to both economic interests and natural ecosystems.  Understanding the historical dynamics of ant evolution will allow us to better predict the future evolutionary consequences of these modern colonizations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nOverview\n\nAcross the tree of life, certain groups of organisms have unusually high numbers of species.  These \"hyperdiverse\" groups offer opportunities to understand evolutionary processes.  Our project investigated the evolutionary forces shaping an explosive radiation of ant species in the genus Pheidole.   Ants are important to study because they are one of the most ecologically dominant animal groups on the planet that are important for a range of ecosystem processes.  Moreover, ants are also known to do economic and ecological damage when they are transported accidentally around the globe through human commerce, so tracking their spread and impact has applied relevance.  Pheidole is a dominant ant group in many terrestrial ecosystems, especially in the tropics, and several Pheidole species are commonly transported by humans and do damage worldwide.\n\n \n\nResults and Intellectual Merit\n\nOur project made a number of advances in understanding the ecology and evolution of Pheidole diversity.  First, we have assembled a large curated collection of Pheidole specimens representing diversity from around the world.  Through DNA sequencing of this material, we reconstructed a phylogeny of the genus that now includes over 490 species representing every biogeographic region.  In parallel, we synthesized datasets on the morphology, ecology, and geographic distribution of known Pheidole species, providing a macroscopic picture of their evolution.  Using these combined data, we addressed a number of questions about the evolution of the genus. First, we found that the global spread Pheidole was characterized by a series of colonization events as Pheidole reached new continents followed by evolutionary radiation in each area.  We showed that these radiations were predictable with respect to how species fill different climatic zones.  Second, we tested and found support for components of the taxon cycle hypothesis, an old but still relevant idea for how species evolve new traits, spread through geographic space, and speciate.   Third, we developed novel quantitative methods to test hypotheses for the joint evolution of traits and dispersal rates, which can be applied to any group of organism.  Fourth, we clarified taxonomic relationships in the genus and described a number of new species.  Finally, we contributed to our knowledge of how humans are spreading ant species around the globe by a) identifying a previously unknown alien species spreading in the South Pacific and b) recognizing that two widespread Pheidole species spread by humans were actually one massively widespread species.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis project supported (either directly or indirectly) one early career researcher as PI, seven postdocs, two graduate students, and four undergraduate students.  Two of the undergraduates have been co-authors on papers are now in graduate programs.  The project facilitated a number of training and learning experiences for all involved, including international collaboration and numerous presentations at major conferences.  Our findings have generated a large amount of media interest including in Science News, the Washington Post, The Guardian, and many others.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/16/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Evan P Economo"
