 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Weather Ready Nation Workshop is a 3-day workshop to be held in Norman, OK\r\nDecember 13-15, 2011.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit \r\nThis effort is pertinent to maximization of two-way learning and knowledge sharing that is cross-disciplinary across the weather enterprise and stakeholder community.  This includes input from the emergency management community, educators, health and safety experts, engineers, physical and social scientists, planners and responders, government agencies and officials at the Federal, state and local levels.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts \r\nThe workshop will promote science to meet the needs of society and our nation for predicting, mitigating, and preventing severe storm and tornado hazards.  The expected outcomes are:\r\n1) Identifying, prioritizing, and setting in motion actions to improve the nation's resiliency against tornadoes and other severe weather\r\n2) Identifying advancements in longer term outlooks and forecasts and their links to preparedness\r\n3) Identifying advancements in short-term forecasts, watches and warnings and their links to responses\r\n4) Outlining and initiating end-to-end pilot projects within the stakeholder communities to improve the nation's resiliency to tornadoes and other severe weather.  Ensuring these activities are mapped into the existing approved National Weather Service pilot projects.\r\n5) Identifying scientific and technological opportunities and promoting innovation to advance the end-to-end process from observations and severe storm detection, to storm scale predictive modeling, to collaborative interactions with users in preparedness, the provisions of warnings and forecasts, and response and recovery.\r\n\r\nUCAR's (University Corporation For Atmospheric Research) Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS) will use funding provided by the National Science Foundation for support of the workshop to provide full travel support for approximately 15 attendees.",
