 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Savannah. The R/V Savannah is a 92 foot coastal research vessel operated by Skidaway Institute of Oceanography as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.\r\n\r\nSince put into service in the fall of 2001, this 92-foot coastal/local class research vessel has proven to be a capable and cost-effective platform for a range of research and education projects. The primary working area for the vessel has been the continental shelf, coastal and estuarine environments of the Southeastern United States. The ship has also conducted cruises that have crossed the Gulf Stream into the western Sargasso Sea and as far as Curacao in the SE Caribbean. In 2011, the R/V Savannah completed 140 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 62% of the total sailing schedule. In 2012, R/V Savannah is scheduled for 161 days with NSF days accounting for 61% of the total sailing schedule.\r\n\r\nOceanographic instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\r\n \r\n1)\tMultibeam data collection and analysis system\t$24,375\r\n2)\tPortable clean water system\t$11,369\r\n                          TOTAL \t$35,744\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\tThe principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) Oceanographic Instrumentation program supports upgrades and additions to research instrumentation used on vessels that are part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratories (UNOLS) research fleet.  The R/V Savannah is a coastal class vessel (92 ft in length) operated by the University of Georgia's Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (Savannah, Georgia).  The majority of the research use of the vessel is in the estuarine, coastal and continental shelf waters of the South Atlantic Bight (between Cape Canaveral, FL and Cape Hatteras, NC).  The vessel has also operated in Chesapeake Bay and coastal waters off Virginia, in the western Sargasso Sea, on the West Florida shelf, and in the Caribbean Sea. \n\nThis grant (equipment only, no personnel support) supported acquisition of a portable clean water system for use in the ship's laboratory.  The availability of high purity water at sea is critical for a number of applications, including processing of samples for various organic and inorganic chemistry analyses and molecular biological work.  Such systems have become standard equipment in the laboratories of most larger research vessels.  Since laboratory space is limited on the R/V Savannah, a portable clean water system was acquired that can be used on specific cruises upon request and stored onshore when not needed (freeing bench space).\n\nProject personnel worked with the vendor to configure the system for portable use on the vessel.  By substituting a newly available model, the system was acquired for about $3,000 less than what was originally quoted in the proposal.  Prior to installation and testing of the system, plumbing lines and valves for \"feed\" water and mounting brackets for the system were installed.  The ship's Marine Technician worked with the vendor's technical support personnel for the installation and was trained for operation and maintenance of the system. \n\nThe clean water system is now available for use on research cruises on the R/V Savannah.  It is listed as part of the ship's \"Shared Use Inventory\" in the ship's Cruise Manual and can be requested through the on-line \"Cruise Plan\" form submitted by ship users prior to their research cruises.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/13/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James R Nelson"
