 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Loretta Au of Stony Brook University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Quantifying the influence of mutations on protein structure and function,\" during the summer of 2012 at the National University of Singapore in Singapore, Singapore.  The host scientist is Dr. Christopher Hogue.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is its integration of mathematics and biochemistry to understand how the function of a protein changes when amino-acid substitutions are made to the original sequence. Detecting and measuring these effects can help highlight regions in a protein that are involved in a specific function, as well as the extent to which that function may be changed. Knowing this can help guide projects in protein engineering, by suggesting where modifications should be made to yield a stable protein with a novel or improved function and also by providing a sense of which proteins might serve as ideal models for design.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impact of this work is to help develop software for learning about protein evolution in a classroom or laboratory setting.  Experimental methods are often limited to studying proteins that have been able to adapt or overcome natural selection; our computational approach can simulate a variety of mutations, including those that deteriorate protein integrity.  These examples provide biophysical and biochemical reasons for how modifications are able to improve or worsen protein stability and function. The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
