 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin will evaluate the impact of the Alliance for the Advancement of African American Researchers in Computing (A4RC). A4RC was formed in Spring 2006 with the goal of increasing the number of African Americans obtaining advanced degrees in computing, particularly at the Ph.D. level, by establishing student pipelines from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to Research Universities that offer advanced degrees in computing. A4RC collaborations are centered around research pods that link students and faculty from HBCUs and research institutions on a particular area of computer science research. The A4RC Evaluation Team will examine the five years of A4RC evaluation data to determine what program attributes are best suited to serve as national models for creating a computing education pathway for African Americans. The project staff will utilize existing data and original data collection to assess the effectiveness of past and current A4RC initiatives. The PI will disseminate best practices and research results on increasing the participation of African Americans in computing.",

Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.\n \nThe Alliance for the Advancement of African-American Researchers in Computing (A4RC) was developed to increase the number of African Americans attaining advanced degrees in computing, particularly at the PhD level, by improving student pipelines from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to research-oriented universities offering advanced degrees in computing. Collaborations occurred through research pods that linked students and faculty from each institution. The alliance received funding through the NSF-sponsored Broadening Participation in Computing program.\nWisconsin\u00c6s Equity and Inclusion Laboratory (Wei LAB) evaluated the impact of the A4RC during the final two years of the five-year project, using a combination of existing and new data to assess the effectiveness of past and current A4RC initiatives. New data collected primarily concerned the final two years of the project. While the programmatic activities of A4RC are no longer funded, the Wei LAB sought to investigate the life of the project in order to determine which program attributes were most effective, to better inform efforts at building national models that improve the computing education pathway for African Americans. \nThis evaluation produced four major findings: \n(1) Student participants with few prior research experiences reported greater familiarity with and understanding of scientific methods and research design and showed an increase in stated intentions to apply to graduate programs as a result of exposure to the collaborative nature of research. Interviews with faculty participants described how such experiences altered students\u00c6 perspectives about research in the field of computer science and, in many ways, changed how students defined what computer science is as well as what a computer scientist looks like.\n(2) Interviews with faculty participants indicated that involvement with the A4RC alliance improved graduate school recruitment and retention of African American students by laying a foundation of research experience at the undergraduate level.  \n(3) Faculty affiliates involved with the A4RC alliance described meaningful relationships and connections forged with peers at other institutions that developed through participation in the program that often resulted in opportunities for future research-related collaborations. Given the teaching focus at many HBCUs, the A4RC alliance community was especially rewarding for faculty at HBCUs interested in producing research and in writing grants for future research projects. As these projects flourish at HBCUs, it indirectly benefits African American students at these institutions who are subsequently more likely to be involved in research, making them more attractive and knowledgeable candidates for advanced degrees in computing.\n(4) Participants in the Future Faculty/Research Scientist Mentoring (FFRM) program reported high levels of satisfaction with the program, valuing the sense of shared community fostered between peers and faculty. Participants stated that they received information and advice about navigating the job market and the culture of various institutions. This information helped fill an important gap in advising at participants\u00c6..."
