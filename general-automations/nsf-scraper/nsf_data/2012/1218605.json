 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computers, and implicitly programming languages, are used in many\r\ncritical applications these days, where correct behavior is necessary.\r\nRigorous, formal semantic definitions of the employed programming\r\nlanguages are therefore necessary in order to verify computing systems.\r\nUnfortunately, in spite of more than forty years of research in\r\nprogramming language semantics, most program verifiers are not directly\r\nbased on a formal semantics, but rather on complex and ad-hoc hardwired\r\nmodels of their target programming languages.  This has at least two\r\nnegative consequences: first, it makes the development and maintenance\r\nof program verifiers hard and uneconomical, particularly for new\r\nprogramming languages or languages which evolve fast; second, it allows\r\nroom for subtle bugs in program verifiers themselves.  This research\r\nproject aims at developing a generic program verification framework\r\nthat takes a programming language given through its formal semantics as\r\ninput, and yields a program verifier for that language as output.\r\nMoreover, the language semantics will be executable, so testable,\r\nand public, so will serve as a reference implementation for the language\r\nand as a formal basis for language understanding.\r\n \r\nSpecifically, this projects builds upon recent advances in matching logic\r\nand its use for verifying reachability properties.  A language-independent\r\nsound and relatively complete proof system takes a programming language\r\noperational semantics as a set of axioms, and can be used to derive\r\nany reachability property about any program in the given language.  This\r\nis in sharp contrast to the existing verification approaches based on\r\nHoare logic and on dynamic logic, since these approaches are\r\nlanguage-specific.  This research will therefore lead to the development\r\nof semantic and verification techniques and algorithms that will work for\r\nany language, provided a formal semantics of the language is given.\r\nConsequently, the broader impact of this research is that it will increase\r\nthe quality and robustness of software systems, and will narrow the gap\r\nbetween the specification and the implementation of computer systems.",
