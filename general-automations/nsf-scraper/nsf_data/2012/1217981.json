 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging technologies have led to revolutionary computing platforms\r\nsuch as computing clouds and many genres of computing grids.  These\r\nplatforms promise to make high-performance computing platforms\r\naccessible to the public.  Realizing this promise, though, requires\r\none to cope with the platforms' dynamic heterogeneity, i.e., the fact\r\nthat their constituent computers' relative powers and speeds can\r\nchange at unpredictable times and in unpredictable ways; for instance,\r\nshared computers may slow down or speed up significantly because of\r\nunpredictable changes in workloads.  The research of the PIs is\r\ndeveloping a transformative computing paradigm that will enable\r\nhigh-performance computing on these platforms.  The new paradigm\r\nreplaces traditional schedulers' attempts to accommodate the\r\nparticulars of a computing platform---a goal that dynamic\r\nheterogeneity confutes---by orchestrating a complex computation in a\r\nway that honors the relevant details of the computation's inherent\r\nstructure.  In this way, the paradigm increases opportunities for\r\nexecuting independent tasks in parallel (i.e., simultaneously),\r\nthereby completing computations faster.  Preliminary assessments---via\r\nsimulated competitions with common computation schedulers---suggest\r\nthat the new paradigm often completes computations faster than\r\ncompeting strategies by double-digit percentages.  The challenge is to\r\nrealize the paradigm in a computationally efficient manner, and the\r\nPIs are pursuing a variety of avenues toward achieving such\r\nefficiency.  Because of the complexity of dynamically heterogeneous\r\nplatforms, this goal requires advances in the technology of both\r\nscheduling algorithms and simulation software.  The PIs are uniquely\r\nqualified to produce such advances because of their complementary\r\nexpertise in algorithms, applications, and systems.",
