The host scientist is Dr. Shinji Mukohyama.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is the disclosure of more information about dark energy, possibly the greatest mystery in physics today.  There is also room for more discovery concerning the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe Effect as well as the Viscous Dark Fluid and the Inflection Point Quintessence Models of the Universe.  \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNumerous cosmological models whose scalar field potentials are power law functions are examined.  They end up with slow?roll behavior, tunneling or oscillating based on particular variances in the potential and other factors.  Accelerated expansion occurs at the inflection point of these models, which presents the case for dark energy, a fundamental mystery in cosmology today.  When the Inflection Point Quintessence model of the Universe\u00c6s present day energy density of matter is decreased by an order of magnitude and plotted where the scalar field is on the verge of tunneling and not tunneling, there is a slight shift from the top of the graph compared to that of the original matter energy density.  We are currently in the final step of the project, where we are writing the program to perform a chi?squared test to compare our theoretical distance modulus with observational Type Ia Supernovae data.  We will write the paper and seek publication for it in Physical Review D upon its completion.\n\nThe Intellectual Merit of the outcomes of the research project is the disclosure of more information connected to dark energy, which is possibly the greatest mystery in science today.  The standard model of the Universe, Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology, has different problems associated with it, such as the cosmological constant problem and the coincidence problem.  This research has increased our understanding of an alternative cosmology whose ideas could potentially lead to better cosmologies, if not, suggest related ideas for better ones.\n\nThe Broader Impacts regarding this project include my gaining experience researching in a premier Japanese institution.  I will apply what I have learned about its policies, practices and underlying philosophy to my research in the U.S. in a manner I deem appropriate in order to improve our system.  Immersion in a contrastingly different culture has broadened my perspective of research, academics and life in general.  That will help me in communicating with future collaborators from Japan and other countries overseas.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hui-Yiing - Chang"
