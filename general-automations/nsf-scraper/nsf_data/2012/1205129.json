 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating a pathway for high school minorities to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs with a primary focus on engineering, technology and mathematics. The program provides Technology Gateway and Project Lead the Way programs to prepare at least 127 minority high school juniors and seniors participants for an associate degree and/or bachelor degree in a STEM discipline, which subsequently increases their opportunity to obtain employment in a STEM or STEM-related field. The program also features mentorships, career readiness training, internships, and enrichment activities. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The goals of the program are to: \r\n1. Ensure that high school minority juniors and seniors acquire knowledge and skills in engineering, technology and mathematics to prepare them for two-year and four-year post-secondary education through Technology Gateway and Project Lead the Way programs. \r\n2. Provide professional development opportunities for faculty and staff that increase their knowledge and skills in engineering, technology and mathematics and prepare them to teach Technology Gateway and Project Lead the Way courses. \r\n3. Deliver career readiness knowledge and skills to high school students that prepare them for the workforce through field experiences and internships. \r\n\r\nThe project plan is to increase its current high school enrollments in Technology Gateway and Project Lead the Way courses by 50%, enroll at least 60% of the high school graduates in one of the STEM associate degree programs at the college, graduate at least 80% of the students who enroll in a STEM associate degree program, and ensure that at least 80% who complete an associate degree either transfer to a four year institution or obtain employment in a STEM or STEM related field. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The program focuses on underrepresented and minority high school juniors and seniors in rural counties that face many socio-economic challenges such as high school drop outs, unemployment, and low income. The educational infrastructure at the college is impacted by providing STEM pathways that offer training, hands-on experience, and learning opportunities to prepare students in secondary education for post-secondary education. The project improves the overall college infrastructure in STEM fields through sustaining partnerships with businesses and industries that provide workforce readiness (field experiences and internships) for students and increases the economy of the service area of the college.",

Three guidance counselors were afforded the opportunities to receive professional development in the PLTW program.\nSTEM participants enrolled in the CPHSMSP were provided with mentoring opportunities through the Minorities Achieving Excellence and Success Mentorship Program(MAESMP).  This program's primary goal was for STEM faculty and staff, Director of Counseling and the Director of Career Planning and Placement to serve as mentors to participants and for participants to serve as mentors to each other.  All participants enrolled in the CPHSMSP were required to participate in at least four of the following mentoring activities: Personal Development, Service, Academic, Spiritual-enrichment/social and Leadership.\nThe STEM Faculty Mentoring and Advising was critical and was the most important strategy designed to increase participants' success.  This strategy help ensure the successful development and maturation of minorities into excellence and success.  Each participant was assigned a STEM faculty Mentor(SFMs) that provided academic support for the students.  The SFMs provided the following services to the 148 enrolled STEM participants:\n\na. Met one-on-one with student and developed individual academic plans for each target student in order to prepare them at the start of their academic journey.\n\nb. Assisted students in enrolling in STEM courses.\n\nc. Offered academic assistance to students seeking remedial help or guidance in their science, technology, engineering and math courses.\nActivities were conducted that assisted the participants in building character capacity, leadership, professional skills, academic advising and building self-esteem.
