Special attention is paid to recruiting and supporting students underrepresented in the STEM disciplines, particularly drawing on the regional population of Hispanic and Native American students, thereby broadening the impact of this program.  Women and persons with disabilities will likewise be encouraged to participate in the HTTPS program's academic and extra-academic activities.",
