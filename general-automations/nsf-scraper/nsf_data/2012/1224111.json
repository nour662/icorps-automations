 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Balboa Park Cultural Partnership, in collaboration with several informal science education and other cultural and business organizations in San Diego, Chicago, and Worcester, MA are implementing a research and development project that investigates a range of possible approaches for stimulating the development of 21st Century creativity skills and innovative processes at the interface between informal STEM learning and methods for creative thinking. The goal of the research is to advance understanding of the potential impacts of creative thinking methods on the public's understanding of and engagement with STEM, with a focus on 21st Century workforce skills of teens and adults. The goal of the project's development activities is to experiment with a variety of \"innovation incubator\" models in cities around the country. Modeled on business \"incubators\" or \"accelerators\" that are designed to foster and accelerate innovation and creativity, these STEM incubators generate collaborations of different professionals and the public around STEM education and other STEM-related topics of local interest that can be explored with the help of creative learning methodologies such as innovative methods to generate creative ideas, ideas for transforming one STEM idea to others, drawing on visual and graphical ideas, improvisation, narrative writing, and the process of using innovative visual displays of information for creating visual roadmaps. \r\n\r\nHosting the project's incubators are the Balboa Park Cultural Partnership (San Diego), the Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago) and the EcoTarium (Worcester, MA). National partners are the Association of Science-Technology Centers, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Americans for the Arts. Activities will include: the formation and collaborative processes of three incubator sites, a research study, the development of a creative thinking curriculum infused into science education, professional development based on the curriculum, public engagement events and exhibits, a project website and tools for social networking, and project evaluation. A national advisory council includes professionals in education, science, creativity, and business.",

The curriculum took a comprehensive approach, with 12 modules covering processes ranging from exploring opportunity through go-to-market. &nbsp;At the same time, working in partnership with local hosts (Balboa Park Cultural Partnership in San Diego, Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, EcoTarium in Worcester), we created three Incubators for Innovation to serve as test sites for the new curriculum.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each incubator chose a STEM innovation challenge as its focus (water resources in San Diego, urban nutrition in Chicago, transportation alternatives in Worcester) and brought together 100 scientists, engineers, artists, educators, students and business leaders (Art of Science Learning Fellows) to tackle its challenge. The Fellows spent an entire year learning and practicing innovation by developing innovative solutions to the STEM challenges. They experienced more than 60 workshops from the Art of Science Learning Innovation Curriculum that used the arts to help them explore challenges; identify problems and opportunities for innovation; generate, transform, and communicate creative ideas; collaborate on cross&ndash;disciplinary teams; and co&ndash;create their solutions with external partners. Open&ndash;ended jazz improvisation helped Fellows learn new &nbsp;observational techniques and practice suspending their disbelief. Surrealist visual and spoken word techniques helped stimulate the flow of intuitive insights in their ideation. Laban&ndash;based movement work helped them learn to &ldquo;feel numbers&rdquo; and bring openness to their search for productive convergence around shared insights. Fellows used clay sculpture to model their ideas and assessment criteria. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>After four months of front end exploratory work, the Fellows chose the problems and solutions they wanted to work on, and formed themselves into 28 teams. Over the next eight months, as the teams developed their concepts into innovations, we continued to support their learning with ongoing innovation training. Fellows spent time with string quartets to observe successful collaborative behaviors in multi&ndash;leader environments, practiced user&ndash;centric iterative design thinking in community workshops, and worked with a theater&ndash;based technique called Rehearsing Ideas to accelerate their prototyping cycles. We also provided teams with mentors, ongoing access to experts, community partnerships, periodic input to external advisory panels, and modest budgets.</p>\n<p>By the end of the year, 22 of the 28 innovation teams succeeded in bringing working prototypes of their novel solutions to market.</p>\n<p>During the third year of the project, we studied the impact of arts-based learning on high school students and adult scientists under experimental conditions, by testing the hypothesis that integrating the arts into STEM-related innovation training results in enhanced creative thinking skills, more robust collaborative processes and stronger innovation outcomes. The research found clear evidence of a causal relationship between arts-based learning and improved creative thinking skills and innovation outcomes in adolescents, and between arts-based learning and increased emotionally intelligent and collaborative behavior in adults.</p>\n<p>During the final year, we created a traveling exhibition that gave more than 125,000 visitors hands-on opportunities to participate in STEM innovation while learning about the innovations and research outcomes generated by our project.&nbsp; We also published the Art of Science Learning Innovation Curriculum; conducted more than 45 symposia, innovation workshops and engagement events for educators, students, scientists, business leaders, researchers and the general public; and created a 76-minute video documentary with University of California-TV&rsquo;s STEAM Channel which received more than 300,000 views in its first 12 months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the years, &ldquo;Integrating Informal STEM and Arts-Based Learning to Foster Innovation&rdquo; has advanced America&rsquo;s STEM workforce development objectives in important ways, by identifying, developing and demonstrating the effectiveness of new ways to blend the creativity&nbsp;and innovation of the arts with the excitement of discovery of STEM learning. &nbsp;The project directly generated innovation in informal science learning centers, strengthened the innovation skills of hundreds of STEM learners and professionals,&nbsp; developed a new model for strengthening engagement with STEM by using the arts to foster 21st Century STEM learning and innovation, and - through compelling data and narrative - shared the model with hundreds of thousands of people across the country. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>For information about project activities and the new products, processes, services and STEM curricula created by Art of Science Learning's 28 innovation teams, please visit our website: &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.artofsciencelearning.org\">www.artofsciencelearning.org</a></p>\n<p>To greater detail about project outcomes and research findings, please see the Art of Science Learning on University of California TV:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.uctv.tv/shows/The-Art-of-Science-Learning-with-Harvey-Seifter-30491\">https://www.uctv.tv/shows/The-Art-of-Science-Learning-with-Harvey-Seifter-30491</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/14/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Harvey&nbsp;J&nbsp;Seifter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224111/1224111_10211234_1510545340065_MetaphorminginSanDiego-page-001--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224111/1224111_10211234_1510545340065_MetaphorminginSanDiego-page-001--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Metaphorming at the Art of Science Learning Incubator in Balboa Park, San Diego\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224111/1224111_10211234_1510545340065_MetaphorminginSanDiego-page-001--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Metaphorming at the Art of Science Learning Incubator in Balboa Park, San Diego\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The San Diego Incubator, hosted by Balboa Park, focused on water resources. 100 scientists, artists, educators, business people and students started their year-long innovation journey by using an arts-based symbolic idea modeling process called Metaphorming, here led by its inventor, Todd Siler.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harvey Seifter</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Harvey&nbsp;J&nbsp;Seifter</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Metaphorming at the Art of Science Learning Incubator in Balboa Park, San Diego</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224111/1224111_10211234_1510530729351_ImpactofArts-BasedLearningonCollaborationinSTEMProfessionals-page-001--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224111/1224111_10211234_1510530729351_ImpactofArts-BasedLearningonCollaborationinSTEMProfessionals-page-001--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Positive Impact of Arts-Based Learning on Collaboration Among STEM Professionals\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224111/1224111_10211234_1510530729351_ImpactofArts-BasedLearningonCollaborationinSTEMProfessionals-page-001--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Positive Impact of Arts-Based Learning on Collaboration Among STEM Professionals\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Data showing significant increases in the collaborative and emotionally intelligent behavior of STEM professionals working on teams receiving 20 hours of innovation training that incorporated arts-based learning, compared with control teams receiving 20 hours of similar training without the arts.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Art of Science Learning</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Harvey&nbsp;J&nbsp;Seifter</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Positive Impact of Arts-Based Learning on Collaboration Among STEM Professionals</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224111/1224111_10211234_1510532829321_CityinaGarden-page-001--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224111/1224111_10211234_1510532829321_CityinaGarden-page-001--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"City in a Garden\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1224111/1224111_10211234_1510532829321_CityinaGarden-page-001--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"City in a Garden\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Chicago Incubator, hosted by the Museum of Science and Industry, focused on urban nutrition.
