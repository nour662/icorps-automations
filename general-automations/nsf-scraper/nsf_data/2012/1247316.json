 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific data is being collected at a higher rate than ever.  A striking example is in elementary particle physics (EPP) experiments, where collaborations of thousands of scientists collect huge amounts of data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), but other disciplines have and are continuing to observe similar growth. \r\n\r\nThe complexity and time frame of these experiments is such that the full scientific potential can only be realized when the data remains accessible and analyzable through extended periods. \r\n\r\nThe possibility of successfully meeting this goal for the necessary long term data preservation requires a novel approach that will make the data and necessary software management more solid and survivable. The long term data preservation will become an even more critical issue as present experimental efforts evolve and the Big Data paradigm develops. The initial efforts of the US community to analyze the large volume of LHC data is being satisfied by the Open Science Grid project, designed to facilitate such large and distributed experiments. DASPOS provides an opportunity to continue to study today's analysis over the long term. \r\n\r\nThe DASPOS project incorporates the present state-of-the-art knowledge in working with data in EPP. This project aims to provide a generic technological framework where the basic difficulties are identified and solved with the aim of advancing these goals simultaneously for several disciplines, which should facilitate the emergence of commonalities and standards.\r\n\r\nThe milestones and the work plan are well structured and adapted to present knowledge. Intense communications via workshops is planned and is a natural path for the goal of inclusion of the various disciplines. The intention to document these workshops is a valuable component of this project, as are concrete goals such as prototypes and software challenges.\r\n\r\nThe DASPOS project is not only sound but also timely. The recent dynamics in data preservation and large data management is now reaching several countries and funding agencies. In fact, several projects at national levels are now installed, including for instance, the PREDON project, financed by CNRS-France in 2012 to prepare a multidisciplinary novel approach to big data management. \r\n\r\nOther similar initiatives are under study in Germany and Italy. It is no question that synergies will emerge at an international scale, and is also clear that DASPOS will play a pioneering and leading role in this context. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the impact and merit of the DASPOS proposal is innovative and potentially transformational. This can be an historical opportunity to make a significant advance in the scientific data management in the context of the \"Big Data\" challenge.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe DASPOS project (Data and Software Preservation for Open Science) was a multi-disciplinary effort between six universities and the Fermi and Brookhaven national laboratories whose aim was to understand the problems associated with knowledge preservation in data-heavy sciences like experimental particle physics, astrophysics, genomics, etc.  The team included physicists, digital librarians, computer scientists, and other experts from different fields of research. \n\nStated simply, the intellectual goals of the project were the following: (1) determine what needs to be saved in order to preserve the different aspects of a complicated data analysis with many processing steps for reproducibility and re-use, (2) determine how to save these elements in a manner that they could be archived, searchable, and re-useable, and (3) demonstrate a prototype preservation system that could do this.

The relative performances of the different techniques were assessed, with the linux container approach (embodied, for example, by Docker containers) given the slight edge due to ease of use and available infrastructure.   A second aspect of the research was to understand how to describe what was being done in a computational step as part of an analysis.  This would be necessary for the material to be searched for and retrieved from an archive, or so another person could understand what was done and re-use some elements.  The studies performed on this aspect of the project resulted in several new metadata vocabularies, including one that describes a \"computational step\" in a complex analysis, and one that describes a \"detector final state\" in High Energy Physics (HEP), the first such description to be recorded.  In collaboration with the IT and SIS groups at CERN, we have been involved in building the CERN Analysis Preservation Portal (CAP) and the REANA analysis platform, both of which incorporate DASPOS research and represent the achievement of the original goals of the proposal.  The CAP will allow individual researchers to store a wealth of pertinent information about their analysis, some of it collected automatically from their LHC experiment.  Executables, scripts, and data can also be stored.  In particular, individual computational steps can be described and captured, currently using container technology.  The metadata description used to archive the information is based on the DASPOS work.  The REANA analysis back-end is able to re-assemble complete analysis workflows based on the archived information and re-instantiate them using workflow engines implemented by the DASPOS and CERN teams.

DASPOS was conceived from the beginning to be an interdisciplinary project with an emphasis on HEP.  As such, the workshops that were conducted involved a variety of disciplines and computational problems, with an explicit focus to discover commonaility in computational approaches that could be preserved with the same basic infrastructure.  For example, although it was derived in the context of HEP computation, the \"computational step\" metadata description is completely generic and based on the well-known PROV ontology, making it widely applicable.
