 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) was formed from the merger of three telescope arrays supported by the Division of Astronomical Science's University Radio Observatories (URO) Program: Caltech's Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) array  of six 10.4-meter-diameter telescopes, the Berkeley Illinois Maryland Association (BIMA) array of nine 6.1-meter-diameter telescopes, and the University of Chicago's Sunyaev-Zeldovitch Array of eight 3.5-meter-diameter telescopes. CARMA currently achieves resolutions as high as 0.2 arcseconds at a wavelength of 1mm and, due to its heterogeneous combination of telescope diameters, provides excellent imaging over a wide range of angular scales.  Science enabled by CARMA covers a broad range of astronomical topics, including star formation and molecular clouds, studies of external galaxies, and the investigation of solar system objects. CARMA is a pathfinder for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and a pipeline for training experts in the field of millimeter interferometry to take full advantage of ALMA's capabilities for US astronomy.   Users outside the CARMA collaboration receive 30% of all observing time.",

Galaxy clusters are the largest objects that the universe has produced, with masses exceeding a thousand trillion times the mass of our sun. About 80% of this tremendous mass is dark matter, while most of the cluster's ordinary matter is contained in hot 100 million degree gas &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo; in which the galaxies are immersed.&nbsp; The galaxies (not shown here in the figure) account for only a small fraction of the mass, although they are the only component visible at optical wavelengths. The hot gas interacts with the cosmic microwave background causing a small distortion, which appears as a shadow at cm-wavelengths, known as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>CARMA&rsquo;s extremely sensitive cm-wave receivers combined with its ability to pack the telescopes in very close to each other, allowed us to be able to make detailed images of the extended (a million light years across) and very low brightness Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, actually a low brightness &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; against the smooth cosmic microwave background. This data allows us to investigate the details of the galaxy cluster in a unique and complementary way to that done at other wavelengths. The figure shows a CARMA 23 telescope array imaging of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect for the massive galaxy cluster MS0735. The CARMA Sunyaev-Zel'dovich imaging (green in the figure) reveals the total energy and distribution of the hot gas. In addition the figure also shows the x-ray emission of the hot gas (Chandra X-ray data in blue), which is sensitive to the density of the gas, as well as the bright radio emission (VLA radio emission in red), which traces the very high energy jets of gas driven from a black hole in the central galaxy (much too small to be imaged). Understanding the structure of these most massive objects requires such multiwavelength observations and enables fundamental tests of the evolution of the universe.&nbsp; The CARMA Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements as well as the X-ray imaging (Chandra) show large bubbles in the otherwise smoothly distributed hot atmosphere. The lack x-ray emission indicates low density gas, but the empty bubbles in the Sunyaev-Zel&rsquo;dovich imaging, indicates that the gas must be extremely hot, billions of degrees or more likely that the bubbles are supported by relativistic protons, placing constraints on mechanisms for which the jets from the central black hole are able to heat the intracluster gas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/28/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;E&nbsp;Carlstrom</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1140019/1140019_10214444_1514512024380_CARMA_23--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1140019/1140019_10214444_1514512024380_CARMA_23--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Combined Array for Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1140019/1140019_10214444_1514512024380_CARMA_23--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Combined Array for Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The CARMA 23-telescope heterogeneous interferometric array at Cedar Flat, near White Mountain in California.
