 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several regionally critical marine sites in the Pacific Arctic sector that have very high biomass and are focused foraging points for apex predators, have been reoccupied during multiple international cruises. The data documenting the importance of these ecosystem \"hotspots\" provide a growing marine time-series from the northern Bering Sea to Barrow Canyon at the boundary of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. Results from these studies show spatial changes in carbon production and export to the sediments as indicated by infaunal community composition and biomass, shifts in sediment grain size on a S-to-N latitudinal gradient, and range extensions for lower trophic levels and further northward migration of higher trophic organisms, such as gray whales. There is also direct evidence of negative impacts on ice dependent species, such as walruses and polar bears. To more systematically track the broad biological response to sea ice retreat and associated environmental change, an international consortium of scientists are developing a coordinated Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) that includes selected biological measurements at multiple trophic levels. These measurements are being made simulataneously with hydrographic surveys and satellite observations. The DBO currently focuses on five regional biological \"hotspot\" locations along a latitudinal gradient.  The spatially explicit DBO network is being organized through the Pacific Arctic Group (PAG), a consensus-driven, international collaboration sanctioned by the International Arctic Science Committee. This project will be a U.S. contribution to the DBO effort in the Pacific Sector, and the scientific needs to be met are consistent with research needs identified in the US National Ocean Policy planning effort, and the NOAA strategic plan. The implemented project will serve as a contribution to the US-led Arctic Observing Network and will improve international cooperative efforts for evaluating ecosystem impacts from high latitude climate change.  Identifying and collecting key prey-predator biological data in the context of high priority physical and chemical measurements will allow for integration of these data into scientific community analyses and ecosystem modeling efforts.  Outreach to local communities and media will ensure that both those immediately impacted and the broader public will be made aware of changes in this sensitive part of the Arctic.",

The scientists funded through this project sampled locations that are biologically important for supporting the food web. These locations have been sampled annually since 2010, with support from the National Science Foundation beginning in 2012.&nbsp; Other national and international investigators also sampled the same locations for standard measurements, resulting in multiple data collections in a year. Data are collected on environmental conditions including water column and sea floor animals that are food for whales, seals, and birds and these data have been shared with collaborators and open data archive sites. This scientific collaboration has allowed for development of a seasonal and interannual time series record that allow us to track status and change in the marine ecosystem components. The project contributes to the U.S. National Ocean Policy and Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee 5-year plan. The data is of value to U.S. and international science and management agencies, private industry, and local communities as they try to understand changes to the environment. The project supported early career scientists, technicians, and the lead scientists for both field and laboratory work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The observational plan included standard hydrographic and biological measurements along five transect lines located in the northern Bering and Chukchi Seas. These sampling locations were arrayed south-to-north and reflect a gradient of seasonal sea ice change and seawater warming, including DBO 1 (SLIP)-south of St. Lawrence Island (SLI), DBO2 (Chirikov)-north of SLI, DBO3 (southern Chukchi Sea), DBO4-NE Chukchi Sea, and DBO5-Barrow Canyon (Figure 1). The investigators chose these 5 regions because they are in zones of high biological productivity and biodiversity (Figure 2). Results so far indicate a freshening and warming of Pacific seawater as it transits northward over the spring to fall season. An annual trend in seawater freshening and warming has also occurred in recent years with continued sea ice retreat. These changes have impacted prey for larger marine mammals and seabirds. Satellite observations were also used to evaluate seasonal changes in sea ice concentration, surface seawater temperature, and chlorophyll concentration. The biological measurements focused on lower trophic level prey, such as worms and crabs (Figure 3) and shipboard surveys of upper trophic level predators, such as whales and walrus (Figure 4). Benthic video images are available for public access at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGvJm1VjGrk\">https://</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGvJm1VjGrk\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGvJm1VjGrk</a>. Notably, there has been a shift in the biomass of benthic prey northward, likely related to changing food production, current speed, and warming seawater. Similarly, we observed more northward migration of subarctic whales, such as humpback and killer whales. This research has increased our understanding of the impact of key environmental forcing parameters on biological change in the system. The collection of key prey-predator biological data along with physical and chemical measurements can be used for future analyses and development of ecosystem modeling which will promote better understanding of Arctic environmental changes.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/25/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jacqueline&nbsp;M&nbsp;Grebmeier</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1204082/1204082_10215771_1514212851316_Figure_1DBO5areas--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1204082/1204082_10215771_1514212851316_Figure_1DBO5areas--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1-DBO 5 areas.jpg\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1204082/1204082_10215771_1514212851316_Figure_1DBO5areas--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1-DBO 5 areas.jpg\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1-Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) map of the five DBO areas and enclosed stations with sea ice extent.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">J.
