 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because the process of an earthquake cannot be directly observed, we must infer the process by determining source parameters that describe the relative motion between the two sides of the fault, i.e., the kinematics of the rupture. At each point on the fault the source parameters are: 1) the slip-rate time function, characterized by a functional form and generally specified with a few parameters, 2) the rupture time?a time relative to the origin time of the earthquake at which the slip rate function starts and 3) the final slip, a vector with one component along strike and the other up-dip (i.e., perpendicular to the strike component), that gives the relative displacement of one side of the fault with respect to the other. The investigators assume a priori the velocity and attenuation structure of the medium in which the fault is embedded as well as the geometry of the fault and the hypocenter of the earthquake. With this information we can compute the ground motion at any point in space, in particular, at the locations of the seismic and geodetic instruments that recorded the earthquake. To find the source parameters they will solve an inversion problem in which they continuously adjust the source parameters. With each adjustment they will compute ground motion time histories (synthetics) at the recording sites and compare the synthetic time histories with the recorded time histories. At the same time they compute the static displacements for comparison with the geodetic measurements, GPS or InSAR. Using a predetermined cost function that measures the misfit between data and synthetics, we continue the procedure of adjusting the source parameters until we have an acceptable level of misfit.  \r\n\r\nUntil relatively recently the emphasis has been on reducing the misfit between the data and the synthetics. However, that is now being recognized as not the issue because any number of different kinematic descriptions can fit the data. The number of free parameters (i.e., source parameters) is often far greater than the number of independent data making it possible to find nearly perfect agreement between synthetics and data. This raises two questions to be addressed in the proposal: 1) Is there additional data, not yet used, to constrain the source parameters? 2) Rather than measure the misfit between synthetics and data, how can we determine the difference between models? That is, how can we decide if one source description is better than another? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn earthquake is one of the most fundamental phenomena in the natural world. How two massive blocks of earth move past one another in a matter of seconds, tens of seconds, perhaps a few hundred seconds for the very largest earthquakes (e.g., 2004 Sumatra; 2010 Maule, Chile; 2011 Tohoku, Japan) releasing strain energy accumulated over hundreds or thousands of years is a basic scientific question. It is also a societally relevant question. The shaking and subsidiary effects (e.g., tsunamis, landslides) created by an earthquake critically affect the built environment. In order to prepare for future earthquakes it is essential to understand the process of earthquake ruptures. By using the data from an earthquake we can infer some of its behavior. By studying many different earthquakes we can understand what features are common among earthquakes. We can also understand what features of an earthquake contribute most to the strongest shaking and to the subsidiary effects.  \r\n\r\nBecause we cannot directly observe an earthquake, we invert the seismic, geodetic and geologic data created by the earthquake to infer the relative motion between the two blocks of earth. The kinematic source parameters describe how the rupture evolves in time and space, i.e., the time when a point on the fault starts to slip (controlled by the rupture velocity) and the growth of the slip at each point on the fault (controlled by the stress relaxation of the medium). Conceptually the inverting the data is similar to finding the parameters (slope and intercept) of the best fitting line to a group of points. The difficulty with inverting for the source parameters of an earthquake is that the number of parameters being sought exceeds the number of independent data. Thus multiple, best-fitting earthquake models may be found. The problem is assessing how different one model is with respect to other models that fit the data equally well and what features different models have in common. In both respects the information can guide simulations of earthquakes for estimating the range of ground motions from future earthquakes.",

With recent developments in global broadband seismic instrumentation and computational technology, seismologists are now able to quickly constrain the earthquake slip evolution using real-time seismic observations and proceed to predict the local damage. We have used the recordings of ground shaking and geodetic data to infer how an earthquake evolves in time and space. The general term for such an approach is inversion, basically, using data to work back to a description of the process that created the data. Over decades we have developed our own inversion technique to account for seismic data that is recorded locally (within 10&rsquo;s of km), regionally (100&rsquo;s of km) and teleseismically (1000&rsquo;s of km). However, the spatiotemporal resolutions of inverted solutions are limited by inaccurate synthetic earth response and fault geometry, as well as incomplete station distributions. Most finite fault source studies using synthetic seismograms use signals with a maximum frequency of 0.5-1.0 Hz, presumably because of the lack of precise high-resolution 3D velocity structures. The limitation in frequency content leads to the limitation in spatial resolution. Furthermore, source modelers typically used hundreds to thousands of free parameters to represent the spatiotemporal earthquake rupture evolution. The uncertainties of individual source parameters are difficult to explore. In this project, we inverted data from five earthquakes that ranged in magnitude from 6.0 to 7.9&mdash;almost a difference of 1000 in energy release. Additionally, we analyzed 5626 horizontal recordings of earthquakes with magnitudes between 3.0 and 7.8 to determine how peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity scale with magnitude and the implications of any scaling on the earthquake process.</p>\n<p>Our analysis of the 5626 horizontal recordings led to an analytical description of the earthquake process of small to moderate-sized earthquakes, 3.3&le;<strong>M</strong>&le;5.3. As shown in Figure 1, this model correctly predicts the peak acceleration and peak velocity for earthquakes 3.3&le;<strong>M</strong>&le;5.3. This analytical model of the earthquake source process has implications for larger magnitude earthquakes as well.</p>\n<p>The August 24, 2014 Mw 6.1 South Napa earthquake is the largest earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area since the 1989 Mw 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake. It produced one of the best strong motion datasets for the class of magnitude 6 earthquakes, allowing for in-depth studies. Figure 2 shows the horizontal ground velocity for 21 near-fault stations (epicentral distances &lt;35 km). Note the two narrow pulses recorded by stations (middle column) south of the epicenter (clearly seen at station 68294, bottom trace of middle column). The second pulse is associated with the largest peak ground accelerations (PGA) recorded during this event. Our analysis reveals that the rupture of the Napa earthquake initiated at a depth of 9.84 km and propagated mainly to north-northwest and up-dip on a 13 km long fault patch. The cumulative seismic moment within 8 s of rupture is 1.28x10<sup>18</sup> Nm or Mw 6.0. On average slip between the two sides of the fault is 0.74 m and took about 0.63 s. We find that the time for slip to occur increases progressively by a factor of five as the rupture propagates from depth to the surface. The two distinct pulses in Figure 2 are the result of an energetic release of energy near the earthquake&rsquo;s nucleation and then a second energetic burst that is about five kilometers away. If the slip in these two energetic bursts were taken in isolation, the magnitude causing the large accelerations would correspond to two ~Mw 4.9 earthquakes.</p>\n<p>We developed an inversion method that allows us to query the data about specific physical parameters of an earthquake while simultaneously finding a rupture scenario that produces ground motion in agreement with the observations. An important parameter is the average stress drop (<em>delta</em>) during an earthquake. Because the stress drop on a fault varies from point to point, the average stress drop can be defined in different ways. We chose the energy based average stress drop as the physical parameter. We select a value for <em>delta</em> and invert the data to find a solution that matches both the seismic/geodetic data and the target value for <em>delta</em>. We step through a full range of target values for <em>delta</em>. In Figure 3 we plot the misfit (total difference over all records between our inverted results and the observations) versus the average stress drop for the 2014 Mw 7.9 Rat Islands earthquake. Two points of interest: i) the misfit is nearly the same for all &nbsp;greater than about 10 MPa indicating that the data cannot differentiate among these large stress drops, and ii) given the uncertainty (the region between the black and red dashed lines) that arises from choosing a set of input parameters, we find the average stress drop&nbsp;<em>delta</em>&nbsp;is greater than 5 MPa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/30/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ralph&nbsp;Archuleta</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1215769/1215769_10189306_1516732379033_Fig1-mod_Outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1215769/1215769_10189306_1516732379033_Fig1-mod_Outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1215769/1215769_10189306_1516732379033_Fig1-mod_Outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
