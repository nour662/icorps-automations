The scientific program for the 2012 conference addresses ten immediately relevant themes in neural interfaces. The presentations, discussions and formal debates related to each theme will focus on the most salient problems remaining to be solved, thereby challenging all conference participants to propose and explore transformative concepts. The conference chairs, steering committee and program committee are preeminently qualified to guide the development of the scientific program, as multiple experts in each theme are represented. The Neural Interfaces Conference has a long history (the 2012 conference is the 40th such conference), which attests to the excellent organization and persisting importance of the meeting. In recognition of the central role this conference plays in advancing neurotechnologies, many private companies, as well as state and federal sources have committed to support the 2012 Neural Interfaces Conference, ensuring sufficient resources for this flagship meeting.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe Neural Interfaces Conference provides ample time for dynamic exchange among engineers, scientists, and clinician-scientists, and actively promotes new, multidisciplinary partnerships for neural interfaces research and education. The conference is an ideal venue for the recruitment and retention of trainees in the rapidly growing field of neural interfaces; because a diverse workforce is essential to advancing and sustaining neurotechnologies, travel scholarships will support the participation of women and underrepresented minorities recruited and selected from graduate and undergraduate institutions from around the country. The conference proceedings will be widely disseminated via a dedicated issue of the Journal of Neural Engineering, the conference website, and a special report written by a science writer for the general public. The conference will seed the development of new neural interface technologies, which will reduce health care costs, provide substantial benefits to individuals with neurological disorders, and result in new industries that will strengthen our economy.",
