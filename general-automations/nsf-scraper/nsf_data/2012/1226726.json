 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences is awarded a grant to establish a centralized computational environment at its new Ocean Science and Education Campus in East Boothbay, Maine. Upon completion, this project will provide much needed computational infrastructure and enable Bigelow Laboratory to make a major transition to sustainable, cost-effective management of data and computational resources during the next decade. The new system will be comprised of hardware to provide expanded Parallel Processing Power, improved short-term Storage Capability, and Cloud Backup/Archival options for researchers at the institutional level, and MVC Framework Software for business operations in the National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (NCMA) at Bigelow Laboratory. The resulting computational environment will meet the current research needs of the Laboratory, and will allow for scalable expansion to meet future research needs. \r\n\r\nBigelow Laboratory supports several ongoing education initiatives that require computing resources to meet their objectives: the Keller BLOOM program for high school students, the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, college-level courses taught by Bigelow Senior Research Scientists through an academic partnership with Colby College, the Professional Development Workshop for Science Teachers, and the Bigelow Postdoctoral Education Program. Each of these initiatives will greatly benefit from an enhanced computational environment since it is often difficult to procure adequate resources that provide students, educators and postdocs with the ability to analyze their data and continue to collaborate with Laboratory researchers beyond time spent at Bigelow. The environment resulting from this funding represents a significant computational expansion that will meet the growing needs of these educational initiatives and will provide Bigelow Laboratory with the ability to expand the educational scope of these programs and the freedom to develop future offerings centered on high performance computing.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported the purchase, installation and development of advanced networked computing and storage systems at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences.  These systems have enabled the Laboratory to provide much more robust, reliable and cost-effective access to computing power and backed-up storage to the scientists, postdoctoral scientists and undergraduate students conducting ocean science research at Bigelow Laboratory.  Prior to these infrastructure investments, most researchers at the Laboratory attempted to maintain their own backup drives, requiring significant investment of researcher and support staff time.  Additionally, file sharing between researchers and between administrators at the Laboratory relied upon commercial applications such as Dropbox.  With the installation of a large Storage Area Network, all research files, as well as financial and operational data, are stored on an expandable networked platform that is backed-up hourly.  This provides a much more secure data environment, while requiring less support effort to maintain.  Additionally, a shared-memory super computer now enables researchers to perform computationally-intensive tasks such as running global biogeochemical models or aligning genomic information for individual single-celled microorganisms.  The Laboratory has installed a 160 core computational system that has supported over 60 applications.  One impact of this investment is major improvement in the Laboratory's ability to generate and analyze microbial genomes, with more than 1,000 prokaryotic genomes already produced by the Laboratory's Single Cell Genomics Center.  Images of the installed equipment are attached to this report.\n\n \n\nThis grant also enabled the purchase of an enhanced e-commerce software platform (Magengo/CounterPoint) that interfaces with the Laboratory's financial management software.  This has enabled more efficient processing of orders for strains of microbial organisms maintained by the National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (NCMA) housed at Bigelow Laboratory.  The NCMA ships approximately 2,000 strains to over 26 countries in any given year, so this improvement in computing infrastructure enables the Laboratory to maximize timeliness and efficiency of product delivery to its many partners.\n\n \n\nThe impact of this IT infrastructure investment also extends more broadly to the education of undergraduates.  Two undergraduate students from Colby College have worked on developing the computation infrastructure as part of summer internships.  The enhanced computational capabilities enabled by the new equipment have enabled numerous computationally-intensive projects by undergraduate researchers at the lab, as well as cutting-edge data-intensive projects by postdoctoral researchers. In addition to supporting educational research activities, the super computer has provided a new operating environment for scientists to experiment in.
