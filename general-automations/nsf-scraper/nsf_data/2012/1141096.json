 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data Analytics (DA) is a field that merges quantitative methods in statistics, data mining, and computer science to discover and summarize information in data. In practice, a good application of DA requires comprehensive critical thinking skills that (1) extend beyond the application of quantitative statistical or computational methods and (2) include qualitative forms of thought, such as formalizing potential biases, communicating personal judgment, exploring multiple solutions, assimilating new information with old, and assessing implications of discoveries. Unfortunately, current methods in teaching DA focus primarily on its quantitative aspects; only after students master quantitative theory and methods do they have an opportunity to think critically about applications. Students who fail to complete current DA courses neither develop comprehensive DA skills nor experience how complex quantitative summaries may advance knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe investigators are attempting to revolutionize current practice in teaching introductory DA to first- and second-year college students. Specifically, they are developing a new course, \"Critical Thinking with Data Visualization\" (CTDV), which synchronizes teaching methods in DA with critical thinking and makes DA accessible to diverse learners. CTDV includes four modules, each of which is motivated by a different real-world case study and focuses on one DA method (e.g., multidimensional scaling). CTDV uses novel interactive data visualization software (and techniques therein) as a platform for students to build from what they know and construct their understanding of (1) how to think critically, (2) the role of data in problem solving, and (3) some mathematical and computational methods for summarizing complex datasets. The software is based on methods called Bayesian Visual Analytics (BaVA), which have been developed by the investigators (see NSF Award No. 0937071). BaVA enables domain experts--e.g., biologists or homeland security analysts--to assess complex datasets and incorporate their expert knowledge within quantitatively rigorous data characterizations, without technical training in statistics or computer science. For this reason, BaVA fosters creative, critical thinking and problem solving with data and is ideal for experiential learning of DA concepts in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThe project team is developing CTDV (including its objectives, curriculum, lesson plans, case studies, and course materials), designing the interactive data visualization software (including tests of usability), implementing CTDV (or modules within it), and assessing the success of CTDV. The assessment includes both quantitative (e.g., tests) and qualitative measures (e.g., surveys and interviews) that take place before, during, and after the students experience CTDV. In addition, the team is disseminating CTDV via a comprehensive Web site, papers, and conference workshops.",

The new approaches for teaching DA relied on three fundamental, intellectual developments:&nbsp; 1) defining critical thinking in a practical form, 2) creating interactive analytic software for multiple platforms, and 3) combining virtual and physical realities to invent <em>Be the Data</em>.</p>\n<p>1) Inspired by The Eight Elements of Thought (Elder and Paul, 2010), critical thinking with data was defined in three parts:&nbsp; Qualitative-Quantitative-Qualitative (QQQ).&nbsp; First, analysts think qualitatively about their perspective, scientific goals, current solutions, and research question.&nbsp; Second, analysts collect data and use quantitative methods to summarize, visualize, and discover features in data.&nbsp; Third, analysts use qualitative thinking to reflect on analyses, sources of bias, and potential implications of findings. &nbsp;With the QQQ, DA lessons were developed that focus on one or more Q(s).</p>\n<p>2) Paired with QQQ-designed lessons, Andromeda was developed: an interactive software that enables analysts to explore high-dimensional data visually.&nbsp; A screen shot of Andromeda is provided.&nbsp; Andromeda projects data using Weighted Multidimensional Scaling (WMDS) (Kruskal and Wish, 1978) and enables students to adjust the projection by dragging data points or sliding variable weights.&nbsp;&nbsp;

As data points, students explore a dataset by walking around. &nbsp;For example, provided data about animals with 30 variables that describe animal characteristics (e.g., measures of furriness, fierceness, strength), students embody an animal in <em>Be the Data</em> and orient themselves in different ways to learn from the data.&nbsp;&nbsp; From a birds-eye view, orientations are projections of high-dimensional data; i.e., two-dimensional maps of high-dimensional data points. &nbsp;As students move in the room, <em>Be the Data</em> (using machinery from Andromeda) informs the students which variables are most active.&nbsp; With <em>Be the Data</em>, students work together to generate hypotheses (e.g., about which variables may group certain observations) and/or answer research questions.&nbsp; For example, in the context of the animal dataset, students may collectively answer questions, such as, &ldquo;What may make animals good pets?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What may make animals good to eat?&rdquo;&nbsp; Qualitative and quantitative assessments of <em>Be the Data</em> suggest that students have a positive change in attitude about DA and deepen their understanding for how to learn from high-dimensional data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:&nbsp;</strong>Over the life of the grant, innovative DA lessons, Andromeda, and <em>Be the Data</em> were brought to over 500 hundred students, including second graders, teenage girls, and college students.&nbsp;

For the three students, research from this grant was the primary focus of their master&rsquo;s theses or doctoral dissertations.&nbsp; To conclude, the impact of this grant will continue indefinitely, as two university courses were developed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/27/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Leanna&nbsp;L&nbsp;House</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141096/1141096_10204753_1524816532226_andromedaScreenshot--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141096/1141096_10204753_1524816532226_andromedaScreenshot--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Andromeda\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141096/1141096_10204753_1524816532226_andromedaScreenshot--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Andromeda\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Interactive, visual analytic software that was brought to the classroom</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Virginia Tech</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Leanna&nbsp;L&nbsp;House</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Andromeda</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141096/1141096_10204753_1523843254959_Picture3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141096/1141096_10204753_1523843254959_Picture3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Be The Data 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141096/1141096_10204753_1523843254959_Picture3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Be The Data 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A student identifies an outlier in a high-dimensional data set.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Virginia Tech</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;L&nbsp;North</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Be The Data 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141096/1141096_10204753_1523843196262_Picture2-2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141096/1141096_10204753_1523843196262_Picture2-2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Be The Data\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141096/1141096_10204753_1523843196262_Picture2-2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Be The Data\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students embody high-dimensional data points, and explore alternative 2-dimensional projections of the data.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Virginia Tech</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;L&nbsp;North</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Be The Data</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
