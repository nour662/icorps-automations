 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a highly efficient\r\nsupersonic ejector vapor compression technology that converts low-to-medium grade thermal energy\r\n(200-400F) into useful refrigeration (20F-50F) at high condenser temperatures (100-120F). The proposed\r\nmulti-fluid jet cooler maximizes heat transfer efficiency by using a propellant with relatively low latent to\r\ncontinuously entrain and compress an immiscible low temperature refrigerant of relatively high latent\r\nheat. Initial prototypes have 400% higher efficiencies than conventional single-fluid ejectors. Phase I\r\nresearch will extend these gains while operating at elevated condenser temperatures. Specific research\r\nfoci are: 1) Highly efficient jet nozzles to supersonically expand a high molar mass, low specific heat\r\nratio propellant without the expansion/compression losses observed when using conventional nozzle\r\ndesigns; 2) Mixing of subsonic refrigerant into the supersonic propellant with minimal kinetic energy loss\r\nby avoiding sonic choking of the refrigerant; and 3) Maximum pressure recovery diffusers utilizing weak,\r\noblique compression waves instead of strong, normal shock waves to transition the mixed supersonic flow\r\nto subsonic velocity. Potential applications for the two-fluid ejector compression technology include\r\nnatural gas powered air conditioning, concentrated solar thermal chiller plants, lower cost combined\r\nheating power and cooling plants, and thermally-driven water desalination.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is reduced economic and climate burden\r\nassociated with the world?s growing demand for space cooling. Air conditioning is the leading usage for\r\npeak-time electricity in the U.S. and largest energy expense for commercial buildings. Globally, the\r\n$65billion air conditioning equipment market is growing at 5% p.a.; and because it is dominated by the\r\nelectrically-driven mechanical vapor compression cycle the strain on electrical grids - and by extension\r\nthe environment and economy - is rising likewise. A quiet, clean, reliable and cost effective heat-driven\r\nsolution would greatly reduce these risks. Unfortunately, status quo technologies suffer low efficiencies,\r\nlarge form factors, and require expensive water-cooled condensers. Initial R&D efforts have proven an\r\nejector vapor compressor using optimized fluid pairs built with low cost components can operate at\r\nefficiencies competitive with electric compressors when operating in moderate ambient conditions. Massmarket\r\nadoption, however, requires efficient operation at extreme outside temperatures. Phase I research\r\nwill maximize cooling power and discharge pressure (thus operability at high condenser temperatures) by\r\nminimizing irreversible losses incurred during supersonic expansion and compression of the immiscible\r\nfluid pairs. Project findings will benefit adjacent fields of hypersonic avionics and low atmosphere jet\r\npropulsion",
