The central aim of this RUI program of research by the Luther College group is to study the spectroscopy of bottomonium and related states, with a focus on the study of the important spin-singlet states of bottomonium.   The Luther College program provides an unusual opportunity for undergraduate students to become meaningfully involved in a world-leading experiment, taking part in every aspect of Belle data analysis, and in the development of software tools for the upgraded experiment, Belle II.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe PI of this grant, Dr. Todd Pedlar of Luther College, a collaborator on the Belle and Belle II experiments, worked together with undergraduate students under his charge at Luther on several aspects of both physics analysis and software contributions to the Belle and Belle II efforts.  This NSF RUI grant supported these efforts during 2012-2015.  \n\nThe PI's work centers on the study of the spectroscopy of bottomonium - the bound states of bottom quark with its antiquark partner.  During this grant period, the group published an important result - the observation for the first time of radiative transitions of the newly discovered (also by this group with collaborators at Belle) singlet-P states of bottomonium.  In addition to this discovery, several other analyses are at present underway in the bottomonium system - including the refinement of other radiative decay measurements, of the production of charm mesons in bottomonium decays, and, related to these, the inclusive production of charm mesons in electron-positron annihilation.  \n\nIn addition, during the years of this grant, the PI was a co-author on several review articles which summarize the physics of bottomonium spectroscopy, or, in the most significant case, the whole of the work of the B factories at KEK (Belle) and SLAC (BaBar).  These articles will serve as references for future studies at KEK, and perhaps also by those interested in heavy flavor physics at CERN and elsewhere. \n\nThe Belle II experiment expects to see first beams in 2016, and do a significant amount of calibration and commissioning running during 2016-2018.  As the experiment nears, software contributions both for construction of tools for data analysis, and for Monte Carlo simulation of the detector currently under construction is important.  The PI is involved in both these arenas, taking charge of a portion of the effort for particle identification using various subdetectors of the Belle II system, and for evaluation of the new array of Monte Carlo simulations used to simulate the production and decay of heavy quark mesons and quarkonia.  \n\nOutreach efforts by the group to local middle and high schools were also begun during this grant - and the PI considers this a very important part of the work of his group, particularly as the local schools he has visited with as part of this effort are in rural northeast Iowa, where many residents come from homes without college educated parents, and where exposure to current work in science is lacking.
