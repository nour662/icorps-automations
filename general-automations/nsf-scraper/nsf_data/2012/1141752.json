 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Novel interdisciplinary flume experiments to investigate the role of the hyporheic zone in greenhouse gas generation\r\nDaniele Tonina, University of Idaho \r\nKevin Feris and Shawn Benner, Boise State University\r\n\r\nThe hyporheic zone is the band of saturated sediment surrounding the stream, where stream waters mix with pore-water. This zone plays an important role in the nitrogen cycle, which has been radically altered by anthropogenic food and energy production. Furthermore, this zone may be a significant source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O), potentially emitting for up to 0.7 Tg y-1, equivalent to 10% of global anthropogenic N2O emissions. While the degree of hyporheic exchange is strongly influenced by stream flow and streambed topography, the relationship between those physical processes and the resulting microbially-mediated geochemical reactions leading to N2O generation and release remains poorly understood. The goal of this interdisciplinary research is to understand, quantify, and parameterize the influence of streambed hydraulics and morphology on the emission of N2O from the hyporheic zone. The generation of N2O via denitrification primarily occurs within the streambed sediments where the catalyzing microbial community is present.  Therefore, the mass transport of oxygen, nitrates, ammonium and N2O by hyporheic flow strongly influences reaction rates, residence times, and subsequent N2O production. By extension, stream flow and channel morphology presumably control, and may be effective predictors of, N2O generation rates. However, a number of important in-situ processes remain poorly understood. For example, the amount of reactive nitrogen converted to N2O versus N2 is quite small (0-6%) but highly uncertain, due in part to an incomplete understanding of the genetic composition of the dominant microbial community and the hydrologic factors affecting their distribution and activity. Additionally, controls on the contribution of in-situ reactive nitrogen generation vs. that delivered by the stream are not easily determined in natural systems. Indeed, the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of natural systems limits the strength of traditional observational approaches and precludes explicit expression of these interactions in predictive mathematical models. To overcome limitations of traditional observational field approaches, this research will use a series of manipulative large-scale flume experiments. Large-scale flume experiments will provide unprecedented control while maintaining intrinsically important variables such as a realistic microbial community, water composition, stream flow, and channel structure. \r\n\r\nThis research will develop new understanding of the fundamental interaction among surface-subsurface water exchange, nitrogen transformation and N2O emissions from the hyporheic zone and ultimately from streams. It will explain the role of the hyporheic zone as a biochemical transformation zone by coupling hyporheic hydraulics to biochemical reactions, through numerical-analytical models and flume experiments. Results from this work will act as building blocks for modeling N2O emissions from streams at the watershed scale. Thus, this first stage of controlled manipulative experimentation is essential in advancing our knowledge of water resources at the large scale.",

The residence time and amount of stream water flowing within the streambed depend on multiple mechanisms, of which the main ones are the interaction between surface water and streambed sediment, sediment hydraulic conductivity and ground water table. The subsurface stream water forms the so-called hyporheic zone (HZ), where stream water is temporally stored and stream water borne reactive solutes undergo biogeochemical reactions. Among those reactions, ones of the most important are those of the nitrogen cycle, which has been radically altered by anthropogenic food and energy production.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Streams, in which nitrogen was typically limited prior to the green revolution, have seen an increase in reactive nitrogen loads, which are a significant source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). Streams potentially emit up to 0.7 Tg y<sup>-1</sup>, equivalent to 10% of global anthropogenic N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Stream N<sub>2</sub>O production mainly occurs via denitrification within the streambed sediments. This is a heterotrophic microbially-mediated reaction that transforms nitrate to the nitrogenous gasses di-nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), and that connects the Carbon and Nitrogen cycles in the HZ. Hyporheic flows, which generate the exchange of stream water between streams and streambed sediment, are the main mass transport of oxygen, nitrates, ammonium and N<sub>2</sub>O in and out of the streambed sediment. They strongly influence reaction rates, residence times, and subsequent N<sub>2</sub>O production.

Sand from the Boise river with its natural microbial communities was used as sediment and leaves from cottonwood trees on the banks of the Boise river as carbon source. The large-scale flume experiments provided unprecedented control while maintaining intrinsically important variables such as a realistic microbial community (from the Boise river), water composition (carbon filtered city water), stream flow (constant discharge), thermal regime (relatively constant temperature) and channel structure (dune-like bedforms). Streambed oxic and anoxic sediments were mapped at a spatial (107 point/m<sup>2</sup>) and temporal (sub-daily) resolution never reached before. This allowed detailed characterization of the evolution of redox conditions within the sediments. To achieve these resolutions a unique and novel multipoint (125 points) non-invasive dissolved oxygen sensor was developed during this project in collaboration with PreSense (a German sensor developing company) and Agiltron (a USA optical multiplexor company). DO sampling points were coupled with sampling ports, from which pore water was drawn out of the sediment for chemical analysis.

Conversely to present-day expectation, production does not increase monotonically with residence time or length of the flow line but reaches a peak and then decreases. This is a fundamental result stating that only a certain portion of the streambed sediment is source of N<sub>2</sub>O and the rest is of the benign N<sub>2</sub>. The specific range of residence times that are net producers of N<sub>2</sub>O depends on the interaction among microbial activity, microbial population distributions, the reactivity of carbon present in the system and the interaction between stream hydraulics and bedform. These results support previous observations that elevated nitrate and declining organic carbon reactivity increase N<sub>2</sub>O production, highlighting the importance of associated reaction rates in controlling N<sub>2</sub>O accumulation. However, further research is necessary to link N<sub>2</sub>O peak values with organic carbon quality and availability. Our results also provide an initial indication of a threshold level of denitrifier population densities above which N<sub>2</sub>O production is observed; and that the relative abundance of the gene associated with N<sub>2</sub>O reduction to N<sub>2</sub> influences the net production or consumption of N<sub>2</sub>O by a HZ microbial community. Data analysis suggests that a dimensionless number, which is the ratio between an index of residence time (which depends on stream hydraulics and bedform interaction) of stream water within the sediment and the time required for dissolved oxygen to reach a threshold concentration below which the system switched from aerobic to anaerobic, could predict which flow lines are sources of N<sub>2</sub>O and those which are not.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/06/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kevin&nbsp;P&nbsp;Feris</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1141752/1141752_10156765_1473175034434_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1141752/1141752_10156765_1473175034434_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1141752/1141752_10156765_1473175034434_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Flume experimental setup: A) plan-view of the flume setup with the flume divided into three stream channels and two service corridors, B) cross-sectional view of measurement locations for the fiber optic system (green circles) and the surface probes (black Xs), C) the fiber optic measurement system.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeff Reeder, PhD Student University of Idaho</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kevin&nbsp;P&nbsp;Feris</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1141752/1141752_10156765_1473175085038_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1141752/1141752_10156765_1473175085038_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1141752/1141752_10156765_1473175085038_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Column set to test the effect of carbon availability.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tiffany Farrell, M.S.
