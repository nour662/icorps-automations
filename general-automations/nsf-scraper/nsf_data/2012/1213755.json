 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the research of Professor Deborah Leckband of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Professor Leckband's research addresses the fundamental molecular mechanisms that enable cells to sense and propagate mechanical information between cells in tissues. The cells of all multicellular organisms are held together by molecular \"Velcro\", and cadherins are the principal protein components thereof.  A protein, alpha-catenin, which is associated with cadherins is thought to act as a biomolecular force sensor, which activates molecular signaling processes in proportion to mechanical forces exerted on cadherin bonds at the cell surface. In this role, alpha-catenin functions as a nanomachine that converts mechanical force into biochemical signals, in order to regulate cell functions. Professor Leckband's program will investigate the mechanism by which alpha-catenin senses mechanical force using techniques including surface plasmon resonance and single molecule AFM (atomic force microscopy).\r\n\r\nBecause alpha-catenin is representative of a broader class of scaffolding proteins that control the mechano-chemical homeostasis of cells, the broader scientific impact of the work may be quite far-reaching.  As important, this program will engage middle school girls interested in science and engineering through outreach activities at the University of Illinois. It will also provide education and multi-disciplinary training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. In this way, Prof. Leckband aspires to spark young scientists' curiosity and deepen their passion for and commitment to science.",
