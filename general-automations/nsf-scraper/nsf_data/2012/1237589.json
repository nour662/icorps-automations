The forum focuses on the costs of space weather impacts and the benefits of improved space weather services with an emphasis on the anticipated needs of the user community from 2011 to 2020. Space weather scientists and service providers seek to better understand and serve society's needs for space weather information. The desired outcome is actionable information to drive improved space weather science, products, services, and applications to serve a broad user community.",
