Approximately 200 to 250 scientists and students typically attend these Solar Wind conferences, which alternate between a US and a European location every 3 to 4 years. The Solar Wind meetings have become a unique and valuable element of solar and space physics research, being organized exclusively to address major problems and progress in the fields of coronal and interplanetary space physics over the preceding 3 to 4 years. These meetings and the scientific publications they ultimately produce have had significant impact on many solar and space scientists in the community today.",
