The 2012 FFT will be held February 16-17, 2012, at the\r\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park. The FFT is a high-level forum for\r\nharmonic analysts to bring their work to scientists from industry and\r\ngovernment agencies. In addition it allows experts in applied and pure\r\nharmonic analysis to get familiar with the latest problems in need of\r\nmathematical formulation and solution. Finally, it introduces young\r\nmathematicians and scientists to applied and pure harmonic analysis. More\r\ninformation, including a list of speakers and abstracts, registration\r\ninformation, and an archive of past conferences, can be found at the\r\nconference webpage: www.fft2012.org.\r\n\r\nThe February Fourier Talks directly encourage dialogue and collaboration\r\nbetween mathematicians and scientists working in industry and government.\r\nThe structure of the conference consists of three main lectures and sixteen\r\n30 minute invited talks. The conference encourages and financially supports\r\nparticipation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups \r\nunderrepresented in mathematics.",
