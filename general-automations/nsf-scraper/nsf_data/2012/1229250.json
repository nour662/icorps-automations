The objective of this proposal is to develop an unmanned helicopter (about 150 kg weight) along with a mobile landing platform for refueling purposes. The aircraft would be able to operate with both electric and fuel. The instrument will be composed of two tightly coupled components, a\r\n(i)\tNovel light-weight unmanned helicopter (<150 Kg), and,\r\n(ii)\tGeneral purpose landing platform that will also serve as a refueling/recharging station and             data relay/repository. \r\nThis composition of the instrument is expected to pave the way for the next generation of multi-purpose/cost-effective UAS into civilian and public domain applications.  The proposed integrated two component instrument development is not considered as an extension of existing technology. It will enable heterogeneous networked unmanned systems operating in unison in traditional/extreme environment. The following specific research projects will be enabled through the instrument:  \r\n-\tFault-Tolerant and Emergency Landing Navigation and Control Systems\r\n-\tRADAR-based Sense-and-Avoid System\r\n-\tPrognosis and Structural Health Monitoring of UAVs\r\n-\tNetworked Unmanned Systems (NUS)\r\n-\tIntegration: Software Reliability and Security\r\n-\tUnmanned Helicopters for Civilian/Public and Industrial Applications\r\n\r\nThe University of Denver (DU) and California State University Los Angeles (CalStU-LA), a predominantly minority-serving institution, collaborate in the project. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe impact should be felt both regionally and nationally. At the national level, the instrument should initiate transformative advances in the computational algorithms proposed. The results will be made available to the broader research community in the form of open-source codes. Simulations made possible by these algorithms will have broad national and societal impact ranging from climate change scenarios to wind power generation to plant biotechnology and improved animal breeding.\r\n\r\nAt the institutional and regional levels, DU faculty/students will collaborate with CalStU-LA faculty/students to enhance the ethnic and gender diversity of the student population, especially recruiting minority students.  Project goal include increasing the educational/training opportunities for underrepresented students, and  the number of graduates in STEM fields.",
