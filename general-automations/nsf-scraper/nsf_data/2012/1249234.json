Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio, Texas. The attendees will include representatives from industry, academia, and government from more than 68 countries. Two symposia will be supported.  The Frontiers in Solidification Symposium will include six sessions focused on papers relating to emerging developments in solidification science and engineering. The Bulk Metallic Glasses X Symposium will consist of ten sessions focused on papers relating to fundamental understanding and theoretical modeling of the processing and mechanical behavior of bulk metallic glasses.\r\n\r\nRegistration and travel support will enable six graduate students and six post-docs to attend the conference and symposia. Findings and presentations from the conference will be published as conference proceedings and will be available to all attendees.",
