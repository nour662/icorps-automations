New emerging computing technologies bring new paradigms to simulation methodology, changing traditional ways of implementing input modeling, output analysis, and simulation optimization. The new technologies also give enormous opportunities for the simulation community to grow further by expanding application areas and providing fast/efficient/reliable decision support tools for large-scale simulations in the new application areas. The meeting will help define new directions in research and applications of simulation with respect to new computing technologies and emerging application areas.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to other operations research methodologies, stochastic simulation has been relatively underused outside of North American and Western Europe, due to limited computational resources, as complex large-scale simulation models are computationally intensive. If successful, this workshop will enable and foster long-term cooperation and collaboration on simulation research that will exploit new emerging computing technologies such as parallel and cloud computing and lead to wide use in applications from healthcare to energy to telecommunications to transportation.",
