 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas?San Antonio will initiate a study of the interaction between atmospheric boundary layers and wind farms over rough terrain.  This project is related to and derived from the UTSA Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology award (HRD 0932339) entitled \"Integrating High Performance Computing in Research and Education for Simulation, Visualization and Real-Time Prediction\".  \r\n\r\nThe PI will conduct a fundamental study to improve the understanding of stratification and wake evolution due to thermal fields for wind-turbine arrays laid out over a rough terrain.  She will develop a multi-scale framework to understand the key external effects between atmospheric winds and wind turbine farms.   The project will develop a new partnership between UTSA, particularly a junior female faculty member, and the National Wind Resource Center at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed study will advance the state of the art in the computational simulation of wind farms by accurately accounting for the key external factors affecting the wind farm performance. Analysis from the numerical simulations and existing experimental and field data will provide improved understanding of interplay of the physical processes between the wind turbine-generated turbulence and the atmospheric boundary layer, thus making a significant stride in fundamental science of wind engineering.  Specifically, the team will develop fundamental multi-scale framework to understand the key external effects: (a) stratification (b) developing atmospheric thermal boundary layer interaction with a wind farm and (c) wake-wake interaction, and (d) complex topography. The objectives of the current study are (a) to develop a large eddy simulation tool that can accurately account for the key external factors affecting the wind farm performance, (b) to understand the interactions of the wind turbine generated flow structures and stratified atmospheric thermal boundary layer under stable and unstable conditions, (c) use the numerically generated data and existing laboratory and field measurements to develop an understanding of the complex interaction of the turbulence due to buoyancy, surface roughness and wind turbine structures.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe project has direct relevance to the development of renewable energy sources in the US.  The results could help to make wind energy more accessible in wider terrains, providing more realistic predictive tools to serve as guides for the future of wind-farm installations.  The project will develop a joint course in wind energy technology to be taught simultaneously at UTSA and TTU.  The project will help in the education, motivation and mentoring of students at UTSA, who are predominantly Hispanic.  The PI is a female faculty member in engineering at UTSA in a field where role models for women are lacking in many quarters of academe.",
