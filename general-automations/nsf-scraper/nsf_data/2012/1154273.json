 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Scholars-on-Track program at the College of Mount Saint Vincent (CMSV) is providing financial, social and academic support to promote achievement of students in biology, chemistry, and biochemistry. The program's primary goals include an improvement of academic performance, retention, degree completion and post-baccalaureate opportunities in these areas. To help realize these goals, the program builds on a \"Freshman Seminar in Science\" during the first semester of study that challenges these scholars to develop the knowledge base, discipline, and critical thinking skills essential to success in the sciences. The program also provides peer mentorship and tutoring throughout the first two years of baccalaureate study and encourages student participation in enrichment activities such as scientific conferences, career panels, field excursions to museums and academic centers. During the final two years of baccalaureate study, participating students complete an original research project and are encouraged to consider the option of an internship in one of the areas of focus. The activities offered through the Scholars-on-Track program have been shaped by scholarship and student support models that have proven to be particularly effective for students hailing from minority and underserved populations, both of whom comprise a significant portion of the CMSV student population.",
