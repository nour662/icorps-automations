 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific researchers are now called upon to more engage more fully with diverse publics and policy-makers. Public engagement, however, comes with its own challenges. As they leave their labs and enter the public sphere, researchers need to consider how to make responsible use of communication techniques by coupling skill in communicating effectively with deeper reflection on communicating ethically. This combined education and research project advances that goal by researching, piloting, and disseminating case studies addressing scientists' obligation to engage with the public, and the ethical issues they may encounter when they do so. The project draws on ten important instances of public science communication across five natural science and engineering disciplines, examining the ethical principles at work in communicating scientific knowledge to a non-expert audience, and using these cases to train young scientists to achieve the broader impacts society rightfully expects.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the recent growth of communication training initiatives directed at scientists, the project pilots and assesses the resulting case studies at fifteen partnering institutions, in diverse settings in those institutions, including communication practice workshops, communication seminars, and courses on research and science ethics taught by scientists, philosophers, and communication scholars to STEM graduate students, postdocs, REU students, and students in communication fields. Case materials and associated research are published in book and ebook formats and in peer-reviewed journals of national communication societies and associations relevant to science and engineering ethics,and distributed to national research ethics case banks.",

When science communication skills are discussed, the usual aim is to teach effective, clear and jargon-free communication that can be readily understood by non-expert audiences. While undoubtedly important, such training does not help scientists understand the complex ethical communication choices that can also influence how audiences interpret their messages. This project therefore aimed to develop tools to train scientists in both effective and ethical communication practices so they can be more sensitive to ethical issues that arise in the context of science communication.

Secondary goals were (a) to disseminate the teaching cases to other relevant audiences, including STEM undergraduates and students in Communication majors at both the graduate and undergraduate levels, and (b) to promote increased scholarly activity focused on the ethical challenges of science communication.\n\nIn Year 1, the Project Team researched case study topics for target disciplines, interviewed scientists and other individuals involved with particular cases and drafted three case studies.  In Year 2, the first three cases were piloted, tested, and evaluated at Iowa State University and at partner institutions. Six additional cases were drafted. During Years 3 and 4 the team piloted five additional cases again at Iowa State University and at partner institutions. All cases were revised, finalized, and disseminated through web-publication. Aspects of the completed project were presented in presentations at universities and at major national and international conferences, and results were reported in published documents.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nCongress, the National Science Foundation and many disciplinary organizations have called on researchers to live up to their social responsibilities by engaging with publics and policy-makers. Public engagement, however, comes with its own ethical challenges. Researchers need to consider how to make appropriate use of persuasive techniques, and how to avoid appearing self-interested or partisan when they intervene in a complex communication ecology. In short, researchers need to couple improved skill in communicating effectively with deeper reflection on communicating ethically. Despite the importance of the issues of science communication ethics, however, they have not received significant attention within either responsible conduct of research or science communication scholarship.
