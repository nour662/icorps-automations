 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates four fundamental questions in quantum information processing. \r\n1. The power and limitations of two quantum provers, in particular the relation of this model with the classical complexity classes of Polynomial Space and Exponential Time. \r\n2. The optimal rate at which mixed state quantum information can be compressed, in particular if a well-known lower bound on the rate by Holevo quantity is tight.  \r\n3. Strong lower bound on quantum one-way communication.  \r\n4. The power and limitations of short quantum refereed games, in particular the relation of those models with other quantum and classical complexity classes.\r\n\r\nQuantum information processing is of fundamental importance to the security, prosperity, and welfare of the nation, as it may lead to revolutionary technologies for super-fast computing and secure methods for communication.  The successful completion of this project will illuminate the power and limitations of quantum information processing capabilities, thus contribute to the realistic deployment of quantum information technologies.  PI will actively involve undergraduate and graduate students in his research.",
