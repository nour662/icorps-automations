 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project, which is jointly supported by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate,  is to investigate how proteins share their energy landscape between folding and function.  This research is guided by the dual goal of learning new physical principles governing protein landscapes and utilizing this theoretical machinery to move towards complex and not yet understood biological applications.  It is amazing how cells have created a number of molecular machines specialized for undertaking tasks needed to control and maintain cellular functions with exquisite precision. Due to the fact that biomolecules fluctuate via thermal motion and their dynamics are diffusive, biological machines are fundamentally different from conventional heat engines or machines in the macroscopic world. One of the key features of biological machines is the conformational changes triggered by the thermal noise under weak environmental perturbation. Therefore their behavior can be explained using ideas borrowed from the energy landscape theory of protein folding and polymer dynamics.  Under this framework, energy landscape theory can be generalized to investigate how proteins share their energy landscape between folding and function.  The current SMOG suite of structure-based models (SBM) will be generalized to investigate important features necessary for complex biological function. Especially important will be to increase the ability of these models to incorporate the multiple conformations occupied by many functional proteins. To fully explore the interplay between energetic and geometrical contributions, SBM's will integrate multiple levels of coarse-graining; lower resolution models handle larger systems and longer times while higher resolution ones focus on details. At the same time, structural constraints will be reduced, requiring less structural but more physical information. A key step in this transition is the integration of SBM and explicit solvent simulations. SBM models probe long-time and large-length scale molecular motions while explicit solvent simulations deal with shorter times and smaller systems. A combination of this suite of methods with new state of the art experiments will be used to investigate problems that integrate folding and function. \r\n\r\nThe PI's energy landscape theory has had an enormous impact in the protein folding community.  Software developed by the PI is freely disseminated, which is widely used by theoreticians and experimentalists. These advances will continue to drive successful collaborations with experimental groups.  The PI has an outstanding track record in training students and postdoctoral fellows in the highly interdisciplinary field of molecular biophysics. Many of the PI's students and postdoctoral fellows are now professors at major universities. The PI has always had a good representation of women and members from underrepresented groups in his research. This strong training effort will continue during the next period.",

Protein function is not only achieved at their final folded structure but actually much of the action takes place in partially disordered conformations. This ensemble of possible conformations (called the protein energy landscape) is not only important to help the protein to fold on its native structure but also to achieve its function. Success has only been possible due to the integrated effort between our theoretical/computational group and strong experimental partnerships. Below we present some highlights of this effort that include knotted proteins, molecular machines and the integration between structural models and genomic data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. Protein Folding of Knotted Proteins</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Experiments have conclusively shown that proteins are able to fold from an unknotted, denatured polypeptide to the knotted, native state without the aid of any special cellular machinery. Our theoretical work has been able to discover the mechanism governing the folding of these proteins with complex topologies. Our results suggest that the folding process for small-knotted proteins is composed of a twisted loop formation and then threading by either slipknot or plugging (see attached figure). For small proteins with shallow knots, the process is dominated by the slipknot configuration. This mechanism has been demonstrated by large computational simulations for which all the molecular details were included starting from slipknot intermediates before threading took place. Inspired by our success in understanding the knotted proteins folding mechanism, we analyzed all available protein structures for the presence of knots and slipknots and detected a strict conservation of complex knotting patterns within and between several protein families despite their large sequence divergence. This strict conservation suggests a physiological role for knots and slipknots in biological function</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Molecular Motors &ndash; Understanding the Kinesin family of cell motors</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the presence of ATP, kinesin-1 proceeds along the protofilament of microtubules (MT) by alternated binding of two motor domains on the tubulin binding sites. Because the processivity of kinesin is much higher than other motor proteins, it has been speculated that there exists allosteric regulation between the two monomers. Recent experiments suggest that ATP binding to the leading head domain in kinesin is regulated by the rearward strain built on the neck-linker. We have demonstrated that this function ability comes from the competition between the tendency of the protein motor to fold to its native structure and the desire of the motor heads to bind to the MT. These results allowed us to propose a set of underlying principles governing the functional cycle of molecular motors in this family. To demonstrate the generality of these principles we have studied a second motor in this family, Ncd. Although a member of the same kinasin superfamily, this motor is not processive and moves in opposite direction to kinesin-1 in the MT. The structural adaptation of the catalytic motor head in different nucleotide states and binding/release from MT is quite similar across the family. The nucleotide dependent order-disorder transition of peripheral structural elements like the neck-linker in kinesin-1 and the neck-helix junction in Ncd are crucial for their directionality. The strain-mediated coordination between the two motor heads in terms of nucleotide binding/release is essential for processivity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.

From this information we can predict the entire functional landscape of the protein. Structural information, however, is limited for many interesting systems. This is particularly true for functional configurations that are transient and/or partially disordered. The recent explosion in genomic information has enabled complementary methods for discovering functionally important amino acid interactions. Thus, in a family of sequences where most of them fold to a common structure, residue positions that are in special contact will display a correlated mutational record because of the global co-evolutionary constraint that the native structure imposes on foldability. Our method direct coupling analysis (DCA), which is designed to infer a global statistical model from a multiple sequence alignment of a protein family, is powerful in detecting this protein contacts. This contact information can then be used to predict protein structures, functional states of a proteins and binding between proteins.
