 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating a set of virtual reality experiments that will expose K-12 and college students as well as the public to laboratory equipment used in the study of materials. Some laboratory equipment can be quite expensive or cumbersome, and certain experiments are time-consuming.  This virtual reality approach is making technical equipment accessible at little or no cost to many more people around the world to learn about engineering and materials science, including visitors to museums and students at schools that do not own this equipment. The modules are 3-D and fully interactive to help attract more students to engineering careers. Researchers are studying how students learn from using these virtual reality modules, which will help others develop better virtual reality educational tools for other subjects in the future. Collaboration with a university in Brazil, funded through NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering, is allowing the modules to be translated and developed based on topics that will help broaden participation in science and engineering.",

Multiple models of each experiment were developed. \nThe modules were created, and were then given to the instructors of record in the Department of Civil Engineering and Construction Management at LSU to evaluate and give comments for improvements.  Based on the instructor\u00c6s feedback and comments, the modules were modified.  The final versions of the modules were used for assessment.\nFour instructors were trained on the use of the simulation modules at LSU. Two from the Civil Engineering department and two from the Construction Management department.  The instructors integrated the modules in two courses at LSU CM 3400 construction materials and CE 3700 Civil Engineering Materials.\nThe modules were evaluated as a teaching tool in two classes CM 3400 and CE 3700.  The classes were divided into two groups, Group 1 were given the modules and group 2 were taught the experimental traditionally using a lab setup in the case of CE 3700 or a classroom setup in the case of CM 3400. \nAssessment      results showed that there is no statistically significant difference      between the assessment of the students that were taught using the VR      modules and those that used traditional methods of teaching including      using Lab facilities as in the case of CE 3700 or being taught in a      classroom setup as in the case of CM 3400.       In fact, the lab reports submitted by the VR group in CM 3400 showed      better comprehension of the subject matter.   Both CE 3700 groups showed similar      performance in their quizzes and lab reports.\nThe project team will keep      utilizing the developed VR modules in Civil Engineering and Construction      classes at LSU. \nThe research team published one      conference paper as a result of this project.  \nEvaluation showed that the VR lab      methodology and technology is easy to use and can be disseminated to many      institutions.\nEvaluation showed that the developed      modules are interactive, which helped with student engagement and learning      experience.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marwa M Hassan"
