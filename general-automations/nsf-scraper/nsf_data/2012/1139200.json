 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium (http://www.math.uga.edu/~dkrashen/gags/)is a yearly gathering in which we will bring together local algebraic geometers with outside experts to focus on emerging developments. Half of the talks will be longer, with the first part dedicated to graduate students. Speakers will include postdocs and finishing graduate students, and at least half of those funded will be early career mathematicians. Each conference will feature an open problem session and all talks will be filmed and made available online.  The first conference will take place May 25-27, 2012.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry is one of the most established and active areas of mathematics and has deep connections with many other subjects. The Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium will strengthen the local community of researchers by publicizing recent advances and perspectives and promoting collaboration. This funding will enable junior algebraic geometers to present their work, and interact with the broader community. Talks aimed at graduate students will make concepts more accessible. This focus on early career algebraic geometers will enable their training, enculturation, and future employment.",
