 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs propose to measure and interpret U-Pb crystallization ages of a varied suite of volcanic and plutonic rocks recovered from water depths of 300-3500m at several hundred sites on the submerged and previously unsampled rifted continental crust that underlies most of the southern Gulf of California. Many samples were collected along traverses up fault scarps and across volcanic features by a remotely operated vehicle; 50 dredge hauls also recovered igneous rock. All relevant samples have been petrographically described and geochemically analyzed. These samples record a long and complex magmatic history in this region, which in the past 20 Myr has changed from a volcanic arc to a subaerial intra-continental rift, been flooded by a marine incursion, and developed a chain of axial basins growing by seafloor spreading. Radiometric dates are needed to define this history, and to test hypotheses that up till now have been solely derived from still-subaerial outcrops at the margins of the rift. Existing dating show striking discordance between the age estimates, hinting at interesting cooling histories with likely tectonic implications. Targeted zircon (U-Th)/He and K-feldspar 40Ar/39Ar thermochronologic analyses and modeling will constrain thermal histories, thereby contributing to understanding rift tectonics including continental uplift and subsidence in the gulf rift.\r\n\r\nThe work will very likely deepen our understanding of rifting history of the southern Gulf of California. Funding will also provide research opportunities for graduate students, foster collaboration with Mexican scientists and the results will be used in ongoing education and outreach programs, such as SDSU's K-8 project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project sought to determine the thermal history of submerged basement rocks exposed along fault scarps on either side of the Gulf of California to ascertain the extent to whick late Cenozoic rifting has exposed middle crustal crystalline rocks along the rift flank during Late Miocene-Pliocene time and test for rift assymetery.  K-feldspar and biotite have been analyzed using 40Ar/39Ar methods from 6 samples (three per transect on either side of the Gulf of California).  This has involved collaboration w/ Jeremy Hourigan (UCSC) to develop new high-precision and accuracy methods for 40Ar/39Ar incremental heating.  Also, Grove has participated in zircon U-Pb measurements with co-PI Kimbrough (SDSU) at the UA laserchron center.  Dredged samples were recovered (from the archives at UCSD) from fault scarps east of Isla San Jose and west of Puerto Vallarta.  Thermal histories calculated from the 40Ar/39Ar results (Isla San Jose transect) suggest protracted residence at depth until Miocene time.  Alternatively samples from the Puerto Vallharta margin appear to have existed at shallow (&lt;5 km levels) throughout since 65 Ma. New methodologies have been developed for diode laser based 40Ar/39Ar incremental heating of thermocouple suspended samples for improved precision and accuracy. One graduate student (Rachel Prohoroff) participated in aspects of the 40Ar/39Ar analysis as a part of her PhD research. A manuscript is in preparation ndescribing the thermal history results from submerged basement in the southern Gulf of California is being prepared.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marty J Grove"
