 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social, technological, and biological systems are often represented as a complex network, whose structure reveals important properties of the system and leads to insights about its behavior. Many methods have been proposed over the past several decades to analyze the structure of complex networks, for example, to identify influential people in a social network or functional modules in a protein-protein interaction network.  Most of these methods examine connections between entities only, and ignore interactions between them. In recent years, however, it has been recognized that network structure is the product of both its connections (i.e., topology) and the interactions taking place between entities in the network. These interactions determine how ideas, signals, pathogens, or influence flow along the connections, and different interactions may lead to different views of network structure.\r\n\r\nThis research project will lay the foundation for understanding the interplay between network structure, topology and dynamical interactions. It will develop a mathematical framework for interactions-aware network analysis that will lead to principled metrics and algorithms for finding communities or modules, measuring proximity between entities in a network, and distance between networks.  Theoretical findings will be empirically validated using real-world network data on tasks such as identifying modules, predicting missing links and others. This new framework for network analysis will translate into new discoveries in computer science, sociology, biology and medicine.",

As a result, the structure of social interactions--the social network--affects not only how individuals behave, but also the collective phenomena emerging in the society at large. The goal of this project was to understand the relationship between the structure of social interactions and individual and collective behaviors. One thing that makes such a study challenging is that individuals rarely have global knowledge of the behavior of others, but must estimate them from the local observations of their network neighbors. Network structure, however, can significantly distort individuals' local observations, systematically biasing their observations of local network structure and information in the network. USC researchers investigated sources of this bias, which they named Strong Friendship Paradox. This paradox states that most of an individual's network neighbors are better connected than the individual is herself or himself. Empirically, the paradox holds for a large fraction of individuals in real-world networks. In order to quantify the paradox, researchers showed that they have to account for higher order network structure. Specifically, negative correlations between degrees of connected individuals (2nd order degree correlation) magnify the strong friendship paradox, but this effect is modulated by degree correlations among an individual's neighbors (3rd order degree correlation). A model that accounts for these higher order correlations can accurately predict the strong friendship paradox in several real-world networks.&nbsp;As a result of the strong friendship paradox, under some conditions, a trait or a behavior (for example, binge drinking) that is globally rare in a network may be dramatically over-represented in the local neighborhoods of many people.
