The research focus is to develop integrated circuits and systems-on-a-chip. The research has systems-oriented activities in collaborative, multidisciplinary and integrative research to support the development of hardware, signal processing techniques and architectures. The universities that are part of this Center include the Arizona State University (lead), the University of Arizona, the University of Hawaii, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the Ohio State University. \r\n\r\nThe C1 center has played a major role in the advancement of knowledge and technologies in the development of wireless and sensor systems-on-a-chip. The Center has developed collaborative and large-scale multidisciplinary projects with its partner universities and industrial members. The Center will significantly increase this multidisciplinary collaborative activity with industry and academia on the development of next-generation integrated wireless and sensor systems-on-a-chip. During the Phase III period, the center will continue its focus on: 1) integrated wireless transceiver systems, RFIC, antennas, microwave; 2) integrated remote sensors, bio-sensors, environmental sensors, and DOD applications; and 3) power management for mobile and portable systems. \r\n\r\nThe Connection One Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) has developed the research roadmap working with the C1 directors and faculty. As results of this, the Center has over 10 patents, over 200 journal/conference publications, and has graduated over 100 MS and PhD students who are today working in industry and academia. The Center has established an active cooperative program to provide internship Opportunities for students and faculty to work in the industry. This has enabled rapid technology transfer between the Center and the industrial partners. The Center will focus on training students, providing internships and an interdisciplinary arena for research in integrated wireless and sensor systems. The ASU Connection One faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates are from diverse backgrounds. The diversity is evidenced in several aspects including gender, ethnicity, nationality, stages of a tenure track career.",
