There will be three main topics at the school: 1) theoretical physics, 2) experimental sub-atomic physics and 3) accelerators and technologies. The contents will be aimed primarily at doctoral students and on students finishing their last year of university studies, but young researchers will also be encouraged to apply. This school will serve as an opportunity for US students and professional physicists to interact with their counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa and to form collaborations and partnerships.  The program is supported jointly by NSF Division of Physics, through its programs in  Elementary Particle Physics Experiment and Theory, and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering through its Global Venture Fund.",
