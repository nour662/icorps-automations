 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Northern Iowa has been granted an NSF award to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site (REU): The Interdisciplinary Research Experience in Hyperspectral Imaging (IDREHSI). The goal of this project is to introduce young scientists to a highly interdisciplinary research environment with a unifying theme of fundamental and applied research in hyperspectral imaging (HI) in eight different STEM disciplines. Recent technological developments and the increased availability of laboratory, satellite, and airborne-based HI imagery has led to a growing demand for HI-related jobs which calls for greater learning, understanding and use of hyperspectral imaging for various applications. Given the advantages of HI, REU students will have opportunities to engage in HI-based research in geographic information science, earth science, environmental science, physics, biology, computer science, and atmospheric science for different applications such as mapping and modeling of land use/land cover, minerals, soils and geologic features, water resources, wetland, forestry, and precision agriculture. The participants will: (1) be exposed to existing scientific approaches and experimental methods in HI, (2) develop skills that make students competitive in academic and professional environments, (3) be involved in faculty-mentored scientific investigations that prepares them for graduate studies and/or professional careers, (4) operate in highly interdisciplinary research settings and work across disciplinary boundaries in problem-based research, (5) improve their capability for learning independently, and (6) provide opportunities to discuss ethical issues related to collection and use of data, experimental design, and professional standards.\r\n\r\nThe site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
