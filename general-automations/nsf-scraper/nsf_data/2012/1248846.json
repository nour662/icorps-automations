 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed Innovation Corps project will enable focused research by the team to help bring a new system to market.  The goal is to offer an alternative to current computer-aided design systems, specifically by developing a tablet-based, pen-driven, proof-of-concept system that abandons the assumption that a system must maintain a valid 3D model at all times.  In the exploring the middle ground between sketch and object, the proposed work addresses one of the significant problems in interactive graphics - how to move seamlessly between 2D and 3D.   This understanding includes not only a computer science perspective, but also a design perspective, where practitioners have a deep working knowledge of form creation but may lack a computational or mathematical background.\r\n\r\nIf successfully deployed, the proposed work will have a direct impact on the creative design professional by making available a novel approach for creating and editing 3D form, and will also impact the communication of ideas, where 2D representations have dominated.  The team's close relationship with academics and practicing designers will provide opportunities to explore and test the new approach through application to real design problems.",
