 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator (PI) will study the characteristics of particles that interact at the Sun during and following eruptive flares and CMEs by measuring the resulting gamma-ray emission observed by various spacecraft. The launch of the Fermi spacecraft in 2008 has provided an instrument sensitive enough to monitor the flux of cosmic-ray protons and electrons near the Sun on nearly a daily basis. These Fermi observations provide information on solar modulation of particle fluxes in the inner heliosphere and detect the presence of energetic solar-accelerated ions and electrons for hours following solar eruptive events. The PI will perform spectral and energetic analysis to reveal the contribution of solar-flare-accelerated particles to fluxes of interplanetary particles. This data analysis will yield information on the primary acceleration and particle transport mechanisms in the inner heliosphere, and will allow the properties of energetic near-Sun particles to be compared with those of particle properties measured in deep space. \r\n\r\nThe PI's analysis of flare-accelerated and cosmic-ray particles near the Sun will be published in refereed journals and will be presented at annual science meetings and in seminars. This research will provide a better understanding of the origin of solar energetic particles, and this will benefit society through improved space weather predictions for the protection of satellites and astronauts. As a member of the Fermi research team, the PI will also contribute to the professional development of young scientists by working closely with graduate students and postdoctoral scholars from various countries in the analysis of gamma-ray data collected by the Fermi spacecraft. In addition, the PI will collaborate with a colleague at the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington DC to mentor high school students involved in a summer internship program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nExplosive events on the Sun, such solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), can produce high-energy radiation that is hazardous for astronauts and spacecraft systems.  This radiation is in the form of relativistic electrons, protons and heavier nuclei, such as helium and iron, and has the name Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs).  The most damaging radiation is the most penetrating and highest energy.  Spacecraft such NOAA?s GOES and NASA?s ACE, STEREO, and STEREO detect SEPs in-situ either in Earth orbit or in interplanetary space.  It has been the goal of major research programs to understand how these SEPs can be accelerated to such high energies, but this requires knowing how they make their way from the Sun to the detecting instruments.  However, there is another way to observe the acceleration of the particles directly at the Sun.  This is done by observing  the gamma radiation that is produced when SEPs directed toward the Sun slam into the solar atmosphere.  Gamma rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation of which light comprises only tiny fraction of the spectrum.  These gamma-rays are being observed by NASA?s Fermi satellite and have been observed by other satellites since the 1980?s.  Fermi is the most sensitive high-energy gamma-ray detector ever flown and can observe the weakest events.  The study that is being completed has used these gamma-ray observations to show that the particles are mostly accelerated after the solar flare and must be energized primarily by shocks produced by fast CMEs.  The study also showed that gamma rays can be produced in a time as short as a few minutes after the eruption of the CME, suggesting that the particles can be accelerated energies a billion times the energy of visible light in a few minutes. The Sun is thus a very efficient particle accelerator.  It appears that only a fraction of the accelerated particles get back to the Sun; most enter interplanetary space as SEPs.  The gamma-ray measurements have also provided information on other characteristics of the particles just after they were accelerated.  These can be compared with measurements of the SEPs to determine how the properties of the particles evolve during their transit to Earth.  This study shows that real-time gamma-ray observations made by a devoted solar monitor can provide the earliest warning of an extreme particle event at Earth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gerald Share"
