 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a programmable sensing and action platform that allows application developers to efficiently and continually capture human activity with minimal deployment cost in support of national priority projects such as energy-saving or health-at-home applications that need to monitor and predict user-activities.   The existing GENI-enabled Bismark Router the platform will be the starting point for developing a platform that addresses the large fraction of US citizens that already have a home network.   The platform extends the Bismark Router code base to serve as a programmable information fusion device for sensing and actuation.   Combined with smartphones and other sensing devices, the resulting system will allow construction of sophisticated applications that rely on continuous and pervasive sensing but which can also use GENI's 'slicing' (network and process isolation) capabilities to provide privacy.\r\n\r\nThe resulting applications platform will enable beneficial actions such as notifying medical emergency personnel, reducing unnecessary power usage, and providing for greater public safety.  The PI will disseminate the outcomes of the project via workshops, the first of which is planned for the 15th GENI Engineering Conference in October 2012.   In addition, the PI will engage in outreach to under-represented institutions and groups via \"summer camps\".   All source code produced as part of this project will be publicly available",
