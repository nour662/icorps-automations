 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly, firms and organizations are creating structured challenges to spur innovation and address both economic and societal issues.   Open innovation virtual organizations are formed to respond to a \"challenge call\" describing the need, providing specifications for desired solutions and setting a deadline for submissions.  Usually, this challenge call is delivered on a public forum with an invitation to those with expertise to share their solutions and an incentive for the best solution.   In addition, a cyberinfrastructure is established to support the development and delivery of solutions.  Solution proposers often participate in an online discussion forum where a social infrastructure is established with norms governing forum behavior.   At the end of the challenge, an award is announced to the best solution provider.\r\n\r\nThe incentives provided in most challenges inhibit knowledge sharing among contributors and collaboration is rare. Consequently, there is limited potential to involve diverse and unexpected innovation sources in solution development.  This project will develop a sociotechnical cyber infrastructure that manages the tensions inherent in open innovation virtual organizations to encourage collaboration among open innovation participants while mobilizing the energy and focus created by the competition of the open innovation challenge.  Through a series of open innovation natural experiments we will compare various interventions aimed at informing participants about collaborative ways to contribute and identify effective techniques.\r\n\r\nChallenge calls can be an effective innovation technique applying science and engineering to important societal issues.  These new platforms are being used to find solutions for such diverse problems as developing an economical low energy use lightbulb, focused drug discovery, and reducing barriers facing returning veterans in higher education.  However, the methods currently used in challenges discourage the kind of collaboration that would be needed to leverage diverse ideas and generate greater innovation.  This project will develop methods to encourage collaboration among challenge participants and help public and private sector organizations find new and creative solutions to complex problems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCollaborating with other people inside an organization is difficult.  Collaborating with other people in a temporary online crowd (TOC) is even more difficult because there are few common norms of behavior or basic knowledge of each other.  Yet, TOCs are increasingly used to collaboratively develop innovative solutions to difficult-to-solve problems, such as new business strategies, global climate change, engineering challenges, and invasive species control.  Prior to this research, most TOCs were managed by simply asking crowd members to offer their own ideas. We questioned this approach because it failed to enable any collaboration among TOC members.  We developed a theory of online collaborative integration.  In this theory, we argued that if we could encourage crowd members to decompose the knowledge they have about the challenging question, it would be easier for others in the TOC to digest.  We built on a theory of collaborations in groups to identify decomposable units of knowledge in terms of problem objectives, examples, facts, and idea \"seeds\".  We hypothesized that, when TOCs were asked to decompose their knowledge in this way and then create solutions that integrated this knowledge, the solutions would be more innovative than solutions created by TOC members only sharing their ideas.  \n\nTo test our hypothesis, we developed a partnership with a company providing crowdsourcing over the internet.  Crowdsourcing features included providing an internet address for organizations to announce challenging questions for the public to address, inviting selected members of the public to participate in the challenge, displaying ideas posted by participants, allowing participants to comment on others? ideas, and displaying a variety of metrics about which participants were the most active, and which ideas received the most comments.   We needed to make substantial changes to the website so that participants could share not only their ideas but also share decomposable units of knowledge and then be able to foster participants integrating the units of knowledge into innovative solutions to the challenging question being addressed.  We then spent 2 years contacting organizations and eventually conducting 24 crowdsourcing events.  The events were randomly allocated to either the website asking participants to decompose their knowledge, or to the more traditional way of asking participants only for their ideas. \n\nWe found that the approach of asking participants to decompose their knowledge and then integrate others' decomposed knowledge yielded more innovative solutions than the traditional way.  We also found a very particular sequence of different people sharing their decomposed knowledge which was associated with the most innovative solutions.  This sequence involved participants first posting objectives, then a participant posing the different objectives as a single paradoxical objective (e.g., offering real time services to a customer, yet not invading the customer's privacy), then other participants validating the paradox with an example or a fact, and an idea seed showing that the paradox helps to generate new ideas. The final step in the sequence was an innovative solution being posted that integrated different prior posts.  Since the precise order in which this knowledge was posted was NOT guided, it?s a relative enigma as to why this pattern emerged.  We speculate that the paradox serves as a sort of attractor for creative people that leads to more innovative solutions.\n\nAnother finding from our research is that internal crowdsourcing allows front-line service workers the opportunity to constructively participate in company problem-solving.  The existing literature supports the process of employees being able to voice their complaints, but helping employees engage in solving the problems they identify provides additional ways to foster employee engagement in the company.  Additional findings include factors that support knowledge integration during crowdsourcing, different roles that TOC members self-selectively decide to enact during the crowdsourcing event to encourage collaboration, organizational design factors to support collaborative innovation during crowdsourcing, and platform design principles for fostering collaborative innovation.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/23/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ann Majchrzak"
