This research employs advanced electrochemistry techniques to probe the redox and chemical behavior of heme models bearing nitrogen oxides as ligands.  Also investigated are the effects that nitrogen oxide ligands have on metalloporphyrin redox behavior, and the effects of the porphyrin scaffold and the trans ligands have on the chemical reactivity of the metal-bound NO groups.  Spectroelectrochemistry, using simultaneous chronoabsorptometry and chronoamperometry techniques, will be utilized to derive the UV-vis spectra of unstable redox intermediates to aid in their characterization. \r\n\r\nNitrogen oxides are present in the urban atmosphere and in living systems.  Metal centers, such as those present in metalloporphyrins as heme models, regulate the chemistry of these nitrogen oxides.  This project will shed insight on both the observed chemistry and redox behavior of newly synthesized complexes containing nitrogen oxides as ligands.  The varied complexity of the sub-projects is ideal for the OU-SIUE collaboration, as it provides training appropriate for students at both a Ph.D. institution (OU) and an RUI (SIUE).  Educational interactions with a minority-serving institution will be strengthened, as will productive contributions to the Upward Bound programs at both OU and SIUE.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n \n\n \n \n The transformations of nitric oxide (NO) and related molecules (NOx) are fundamental to biology.  Most such transformations are mediated by an iron-containing molecule called \"heme\" which lurks within a number of enzymes.  An understanding of the exact sequence of transformations NOx species undergo in their interactions with heme yields insight into how biology works. Our contribution to this area has been to prepare a series of heme-analogues, prove their identity and purity by spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic means, especially to probe the structural consequences of adding or removing electrons from these molecules.  Our set of analogues includes both iron and chemically-similar-ruthenium compounds attached to heme-like \"porphyrin\" units, and non-heme structures.\n \n            The award was made to a collaborative team at the University of Oklahoma (OU, a research institution) and Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE, a primarily undergraduate institution).  This project outcome describes the results at the SIUE site and the reader is directed also to the OU report for the complete story of the award.\n \nIntellectual Merit:  The significant results of this award cover the ability to synthesize the target compounds, (especially by methods which are \"friendly\" to undergraduates), and the consequences of electron-transfer to- and from the target compounds.  The results can be divided into 5 activities:\n \nControl Electrochemistry Studies on Non-NO-containing Species.  We undertook a study of our starting materials before NO was attached to the metal atom so we would be able to recognize what NO-loss looks like. With these results, we are able to identify species which result from the loss of NOx from our target compounds.  An important finding is the difference in chemistry following oxidation of [Fe(tetratolylporphyrin)OR] species, where the fate of the iron complex was determined by the size of the \"OR\" group originally attached to the metal atom.\n \nStudies of the nitrosylation of iron and ruthenium species.  One goal has been to ease the preparation of the target compounds to make the project more undergraduate friendly.  One problematic step has involved the use of isoamylnitrite, an easily-vaporized liquid which has physiological effects when inhaled.  We examined the possibility of replacing this substance with \"Diazald\", which is a solid.  For some compounds, this replacement was viable, but it was not an all-purpose solution.\n \nHalogenation of metalloporphyrin alkoxides with BCl3. In a similar vein to the nitrosylation work, replacement of the volatile and toxic BCl3 with the comparatively safer acetylchloride/methanol system proved very effective to replace a \"Ru-OR\" unit by a \"Ru-Cl\" unit.\n \nElectrochemistry and Spectroelectrochemistry of [Ru(NO)(por)Cl] species. A difference between the iron and ruthenium species we study is that the ruthenium almost exclusively has six other atoms attached, while iron can have 5 or 6.  We have found conditions where the details of the loss of the chloride can be examined in terms of rate and driving force for a series of structurally related compounds.  This information will provide insight into the differences between the ruthenium and iron systems, and will us to understand the limits of the analogy made between iron complexes and their ruthenium analogues.\n \nBroader Impacts:  Training has been an important feature of this work.  The graduate students, and undergraduate students involved in this work either entered the workforce as highly trained technical personnel, or are pursuing further study.  This award gave an opportunity for 12 undergraduates and 5 M.S. students to participate. These students have also been involved in a number of outreach activities ranging from demonstrations at schools, tours of the new Chemistry facilities at SIUE, participation as judges at local science fairs and science olympiads etc (See photo of Dr. Shaw with elementary school student).  Reciprocal visits of students and faculty (See photo of Dr. Shaw with Dr. Awasabisah at OU) between the two sites have allowed the two sets of students to have valuable interactions with both PI?s.  The PI?s have made public presentations of this work in various formats including at conferences, on the radio, in a local newspaper, and on YouTube.\n             The award has made possible a number of technical tools to help other individuals learn to perform electrochemical research.  A set of programs for electrochemical data collection and analysis was written in LabVIEW has been made available, and a blog was set up to answer common questions (see https://decibel.ni.com/content/people/roadchem?view=overview , accessed 2016-Nov-07)  Finally, an instrument called a potentiostat was developed and patented (See photo of data).  While potentiostat are not new, the innovations developed under this award permit the construction of inexpensive instruments which should within the reach of the budget for the typical freshman laboratory, thus permitting modern methods of electrochemistry to be taught to students who need to know more about batteries, fuel cells, and solar cells than their predecessors\n\n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael J Shaw"
