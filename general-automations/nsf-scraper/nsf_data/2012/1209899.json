 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CRPA project is about research on climate change impacts in the Amazonian rain forest and about motivating youth to consider science as a career objective. The project is an exhibit in Biosphere 2 in Arizona wherein a rain forest is maintained and will be used to augment the exhibit of large photos of scientists doing research. Particular attention will be paid to female scientists to motivate young girls.  Biosphere 2 and the Girl Scout Council of Southern Arizona will collaborate to attract girls through free admission days to Biosphere 2.\r\n\r\nThese large photos will be equipped with sound and video so that as a visitor approaches the photo, the sounds of the forest as well as the researcher(s) will be heard. At this point the researcher, in the photograph, will begin a monologue with the visitor explaining what scientists  are investigating and who the other workers are. In this monologue, the researcher will explain what they are doing specifically, why they are investigating this subject, and what they plan to derive as a scientific result. The exhibit will consist of fifty very large photographs (3x5 feet) with sound access via smart phones and headsets. In addition, there will be hands on equipment and docents for questions and discussion. The venue receives about 100,000 visitors per year consisting mainly of families, tourists, and clubs.\r\n\r\nThrough this exhibit, the researchers intend to motivate youth to develop interests in STEM topics. Girls are the main target audience.  For families and tourists, the exhibit communicates the message of how science is being used to determine the effect of climate change on rain forests and how that would affect other aspects of weather and the global environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe information gap between scientists and the general public has only widened over the past decades.  There is a critical need to create a greater connection and communication between scientists and the general public.  A professional photographer has the ability to turn images into an intimate human portrayal of NSF-supported science with an approach based on two ideas: \u00e6Art initiates the connection between researchers and public audiences through visual stimulation.\u00c6 and \u00e6The one-on-one experience with a researcher through audio-visual means increases public engagement with climate change science.\u00c6\n\n \n\nTo connect the public with scientists, we created a multimedia exhibit to bring our research investigating tropical forest responses to climate change in the Amazon basin to public audiences at Biosphere 2 and the Arizona-Sonoran Desert museum (ASDM), both close to Tucson, Arizona.  The exhibit consisted of background information about the research, the exhibit and to give the visitors a sense of place; a video documenting our travels to the research stations and field work process in action; life size (four by six foot) images of the scientists at work or relaxing in the Amazon basin in Brazil and Peru; five of those images had a sound-bite associated with them of the particular research explaining to the audience what they were doing, why that is important, and how they came to do the research; and an exhibit guide.\n\n \n\nDue to the international nature of the attraction of the venues within the greater Tucson area, the people who visited our exhibit came from most US states and many countries across the globe.  Overall more than 30,000 people have interacted with the exhibit, of which ~3,600 at the ASDM.  At Biosphere 2 ~4,500 people have spend a day or more within the exhibit space as part of a conference, of which ~500 were either high school age or younger and teachers. The audio segments associated with some of the images have been listened to in full almost 2,000 times.\n\n \n\nThe exhibit was successful in giving the visitors a realistic picture of what research scientists do in the field, increasing the visitor\u00c6s sense of the wonders and challenges of doing fieldwork in the Amazon basin.  Visitors were furthermore impressed with the diversity and especially the number of women conducting research. The exhibit also provided inspiration for girls to pursue scientific careers exemplified by the comment of one female student: \u00e6If I had seen an exhibit like this when I was in middle school I would have had a much clearer vision of the career path I have stumbled upon.\u00c6\n\n \n\nVisitors coming to the exhibit were more engaged with the content when someone in the room, who was informed on the content and intentions, engaged them.  Visitors needed to be prompted to take the treasure hunt and survey handout and explore the exhibit.  The art by itself was not strong enough to draw the relatively informed public at Biosphere 2 and ASDM to the images and engage with the content.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joost Van Haren"
