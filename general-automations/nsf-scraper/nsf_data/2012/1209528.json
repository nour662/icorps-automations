 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Fenyang Stewart of North Carolina A&T State University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Developing computer programs that make human-like decisions to improve transportation systems,\" during the summer of 2012 at Beijing Jiaotong University in Beijing, China.  The host scientist is Dr. Wenchuan Cai.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is employing methods that use fuzzy logic to control transportation systems.   Fuzzy Logic is a form of decision making that uses subjective language to describe and control systems.  Fuzzy Logic can model non-linear systems that are mathematically difficult or impossible to model. Fuzzy logic is being applied to the control of high-speed trains, which is the preferred method of long-distance travel in China. This research has applications in the control of unmanned ground vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and nanosatellite swarms. \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n This project  imparted the opportunity for international research collaboration in East Asia for eight weeks during the summer of 2012. The primary goals of the project were to expose graduate students such as myself  to East Asia science and engineering in the context of a research laboratory, and to initiate personal relationships that will help foster collaborations with foreign counterparts in the future. This project provided first-hand research experience, an introduction to the science and science policy infrastructure, and orientation to the culture and language in East Asia.  My host site was Beijing Jiaotong University, located in China's capital city, where I was mentored by Dr. Cai Wenchuan, professor in the School of Electronics and Information Engineering.  \n\n My research topic was based on the design of Smart buildings, which intelligently use renewable energy resources such as solar panels and wind mills, to control building operations such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC).   The main goals of the smart building design are to reduce the usage of electricity from the power grid, minimize the overall energy costs, and to take into account factors such as user comfort when making control decisions.   \n\n   I proposed that an Intelligent, Distributed Multi-agent system will provide a real-time, verifiable, robust solution to this problem. Our research was based on simulating the control of one room of a small commercial building.  The inputs collected from the agents were presence (how many people are in the room), current time and room temperature, luminescence, air quality of the room, user comfort level,  and building energy estimated use.  The outputs are control actions that  adjust the lighting and window blinds, HV/AC flow, building electrical demand, along with a decision whether to switch from solar energy to the power grid.  If user input is not at a level that most occupants feel comfortable with, which can affect their productivity and even cause sickness, adjustments will be made to the average temperature, luminescence, and air quality of the room.   Algorithms and simulations were developed to solve this problem using MATLAB. The application of engineering concepts of q-theory, machine learning and fuzzy logic to Smart buildings gives this research high merit.\n\n The expected outcomes of this research were met by completing the algorithm development stage. This stage includes the testing of different control schemes and deciding which control scheme is the best to use for our project in terms of reusability, knowledge transfer, and elegance. Our future completed system will be novel in that it takes into consideration user preference, optimizes energy use, and maximizes the use of currently available renewable energy resources.  This completed system will serve as the basis of my dissertation.\n\n Participating in international collaborative research helped create many broader impacts.  I was able to view the research problem from a different perspective via international collaboration and thus provide more effective solutions.  I fostered relationships with the  huge pool of talented students and professors there which could result in future research collaboration.  As PI, I was afforded the opportunity to present my research to the graduate students in the lab at my partner university and to the EAPSI students and faculty mentors at the end of the program.  My advisor provided excellent leadership and the chinese graduate students were very helpful and friendly.  This international experience helped provide me with much-needed mentorship during the final but most important phase of my doctoral program. \n\n I believe this project helped and will help contribute to advances that improve the environment, commercial technology, public health and safety. The environment will be improved by utilizing green energy resources, which can reduce pollution caused by the burning of coal and oil..."
