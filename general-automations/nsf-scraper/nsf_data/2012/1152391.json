 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates a low cost, high efficiency\r\nportable power system called the QM Power ?PoD?? (Power on Demand). The PoD will power handheld\r\nconsumer electronic devices (cell phones, tablets, laptops etc) utilizing a rechargeable battery and an\r\nadvanced, mechanical energy generator system. QM Power, in conjunction with development partner\r\nDell Engineering Services, will complete the design, analysis, prototyping and system integration of its\r\ngenerator technology into the PoD and will evaluate various accessories which allow the user to input\r\nmechanical energy via a crank, gravity assist mechanism or other methods. Research results from the\r\nPhase I effort indicate that utilizing QM Power generator technology in an auxiliary power/recharging\r\nsystem has the potential to reduce human input requirements by over 30% compared to state-of-the-art\r\nproduct offering now available.\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are that the PoD will enable users to obtain critical power on\r\ndemand and provide substantial environmental and public benefits (reducing grid dependence,\r\ndisposable battery issues and providing power to emerging markets that lack access). Mobile devices\r\nhave become increasingly power hungry while advances in battery energy density have not kept pace.\r\nAs a result, the length of use, mobility, and ease use of these devices have been hampered. The QM\r\nPower PoD is designed as a hybrid, auxiliary power pack solution that combines a longer life\r\nrechargeable battery solution with a supplementary source of renewable, on-demand power that does not\r\nrequire access to the grid.",
