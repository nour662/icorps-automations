 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support research on mathematical methods for signal representation and signal reconstruction in high dimensional problems.  The project investigates randomized row-action methods as a tool for high dimensional signal recovery problems.  Row-action algorithms are often well suited for large problems since they involve low complexity iterations that scale well in high dimensions.  Moreover, the online nature of row-action methods is suitable for streaming data applications where one sequentially obtains access to individual parts of the entire system. Randomization is an essential tool for enabling row-action methods to yield provably fast and accurate results.  The project will investigate randomized row-action methods for high dimensional applications such as signal reconstruction from frame coefficients, reconstruction from quantized samples, and sparse approximation.  The project also studies the complementary problem of how to digitally encode information when high dimensionality places an enormous burden on physical devices,  computational resources, and data storage.  The project analyzes and designs efficient and robust analog-to-digital conversion algorithms for finite frames, compressed sensing problems, and ultra wideband interleaved sampling in non-synchronized environments.  \r\n\r\nThe enormous size of modern data sets poses fundamental challenges to the ways in which data is analyzed, digitized, processed, and represented.  Disparate problems such as computerized tomography, hyperspectral imaging, radar, and phase retrieval can involve signal classes that are so high dimensional that classically designed methods become impractical. This award will support the development of mathematical techniques to provide digital signal representations and signal reconstruction algorithms for emerging classes of high dimensional problems. The challenges of high dimensional data require approaches that go beyond linear signal representations and which are able to efficiently take advantage of nonlinearly structured signal classes and capitalize on very modest oversampling. A typical scenario occurs for high dimensional data such as streaming HD video that have information content of intrinsically lower dimension such as relatively few moving shapes. The analysis and algorithms in this project will apply broadly to modern signal processing techniques such as ultra wideband communications, compressed sensing problems, consistent reconstruction, analog-to-digital conversion and sigma-delta quantization.  The award will support graduate student training, and graduate students will be involved in the project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project investigates mathematical methods for providing signal representations in practical high dimensional problems.  The project adresses both applied and theoretical issues.  \n\nQuantization or analog-to-digital conversion is an important step in signal processing which makes it possible to store analog signals (such as audio) in a digitally useable format on digital devices.  Memoryless scalar quantization (MSQ) is a simple form of quantization that is often studied under the simplifying uniform noise model.  The project studies consistent reconstruction as a signal recovery method for MSQ and provides a precise theoretical error analysis of consistent reconstruction.  This rigorously quantifies the extent to which consistent reconstruction outperforms linear reconstruction for high dimensional problems that are subject to constrained oversampling.  \n\nFusion frames are a tool for providing signal representions in problems where information is measured on a collection of redundant overlapping subspaces of the signal space.  For example, fusion frames have been proposed as a natural tool for sensor fusion and distributed sensor networks.  The project investigates randomized subspace-action methods as a signal recovery step for fusion frames.  The project provides error analysis for row-action and subspace-action methods and studies the role of randomization.  The project also considers quantization for fusion frames and studies an adaptation of Sigma-Delta quantization and error diffusion to the vector-valued setting of fusion frames.\n\nThe project studies theoretical obstructions which can prevent signal representations from having certain desirable properties.  Shift-invariant spaces (SIS) are important signal classes that are generated by the translations of a set of generating functions; shift-invariant spaces are widely used in areas such as signal processing, sampling theory, and approximation theory.  The project proves sharp Balian-Low type uncertainty principles for shift-invariant spaces; this quantifies the trade-offs between localization of SIS generators and the degree of desirable spanning structure in the associated SIS signal representations.  The project also studies the extent to which non-negativity acts as an obstruction to signal representations in general signal spaces.\n\nFive PhD students were partially supported by this project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexander M Powell"
