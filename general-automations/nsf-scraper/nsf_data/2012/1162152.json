 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing efficient solid-state data storage device and system design solutions. Although solid-state data storage has shown a high potential to significantly advance storage systems to achieve ultra-high performance with low energy consumption, continuous semiconductor technology scaling makes it increasingly challenging to realize efficient and reliable solid-state data storage devices and systems for the storage hierarchy in large-scale systems, such as data centers and cloud systems. \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the theme of developing solid-state data storage design techniques from both software and hardware. Major solid-state data storage device architecture functions, including error correction coding, wear-leveling and garbage collection algorithms, are being developed. Workload and device-aware solid-state data storage system design solutions are also being developed for large data center applications. Design solutions will be evaluated using an experimental hardware platform and the Linux operating system.\r\n \r\nThe broader impact of the proposed research is that it will enable the development of highly reliable and low-cost solid-state data storage devices and systems for large-scale computing and storage systems. The adoption of the design methodology by solid-state data storage architects, system designers, and data-intensive practitioners may provide a direct benefit to this strategically important high technology sector critical to the economic health of the nation. This team will also introduce new research results into courses.",
