This research uses a nationally representative Web survey over 1000 citizens, to examine how citizens' reactions to political disagreement affect voter turnout and political participation.\r\n\r\nThis project tackles a question of central importance in the study of democracy and the implications of an informed citizenry.  This research will expand and deepen our understanding of how citizens experience political engagement.",
