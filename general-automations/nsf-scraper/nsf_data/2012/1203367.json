 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the Denver Museum of Nature & Science (DMNS) to provide cabinetry for uncrowding and re-curating the insect collection, ensuring optimum physical accessibility and preservation, and to initiate the electronic accessibility of the collection through populating the Museum's new database system, KE Emu. The collection comprises more than 796,000 specimens recording 130 years of changing biodiversity in the region and the world, and since 2007, has experienced the greatest period of growth in its 110-year history, a 728% increase in overall size. This increase has been coupled with concurrent research and focused collecting programs. DMNS is currently building a new state-of-the-art collections preservation facility. Over 100,000 records will be databased over the course of the project. Substantially improved accessibility and visibility will increase the use of the collection for scientific and outreach purposes. The butterfly and moth collection will be showcased, partially uncrowded and in new cabinets, during an international lepidopterist's conference that DMNS hosts in July 2012.\r\n\r\nAs one of the larger natural history museums in the country with 1.4 million visitors annually, DMNS will build on a record of providing access and opportunities to the public to view and learn about collections (3,600+ visitors to the entomology collection in 2011). The collection will continue to be leveraged to enhance the Museum's exhibits, visitor programming, various educational programs, and online venues. The Museum's large volunteer program, which unites the public with collections and science, will help carry out project-related tasks. A series of Scientists-in-Action satellite broadcasts that connect curators with grades 4-12 students will highlight the collections and their importance. Additionally, underrepresented high school students (young women and minority students) interested in science careers will work in the entomology collections on research and collections projects through the Museum's successful Teen Science Scholars Program.",

The Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science is taking this responsibility seriously by having raised funds and having built a new state-of-the-art collections facility, the Avenir Collections Center. The 63,000-square-foot, two-level building provides consolidated, climate-controlled, safe and accessible housing for over 2 million specimens and artifacts, with the entomology collection comprising 980,000 insects. The Center was completed in 2014, and in September that year, the entomology collection moved in.</p>\n<p>This CSBR grant has provided the support that enabled a smooth and safe moving operation and the best possible new home for the collection: With the help of a grant-funded curatorial assistant, and the provision of 138 custom-built steel-cabinets by Delta Designs (made in the USA), stacked 10 ft high on Spacesaver compactors (also made in the USA), the move was executed in only one week, without breakage of a single specimen. By now the whole collection is fully re-arranged. The specimens are no longer crowded and partly inaccessible. Everything is stored safely, and can easily be found and provided to researchers, artists, and for public events in the adjacent zoology workshop.</p>\n<p>Physical accessibility is not enough to raise awareness, attract interest, and increase use of the collection. With the help of the curatorial assistant, we hosted an international meeting of butterfly and moth researchers in 2012 which brought around 300 scientists to Denver, 70 of which worked in the collection. We also hosted a couple of smaller meetings in the collection&rsquo;s workshop. All this raised the visibility of the collection in the scientific community significantly. Beyond attracting scientists through meetings, a large part of this grant was databasing the collections. Before the grant started, we had just over 1000 specimens databased in an inaccessible in-house database. The grant enabled us to grow our team of citizen scientists (volunteers) to database 75,000 more, and with the support of a parallel ADBC grant, we have now the data (where, when, what collected) of 132,000 insects and arachnids in a freely accessible database consortium (SCAN; <a href=\"http://symbiota4.acis.ufl.edu/scan/portal/collections/index.php\">http://symbiota4.acis.ufl.edu/scan/portal/collections/index.php</a>), to be studied and seen online by anybody in the world.</p>\n<p>The grant has provided the seed for development and growth of the DMNS entomology collection at high standards, increasing both physical and virtual accessibility enormously, and has already resulted in increased interest in and use of the collection, and to an increased number of specimen donations. Collectors and donors value good storage conditions, accessibility and high activity in collections, for all of which the grant has provided crucial and sustainable start-up support.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/30/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Frank&nbsp;Krell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div
