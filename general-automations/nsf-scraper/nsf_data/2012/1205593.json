 "awd_abstract_narration": "Together with theory and experimentation, computer simulation now constitutes the ?third pillar? of scientific inquiry, enabling researchers to build and test models of complex phenomena that cannot be replicated in the laboratory.  The method of Molecular Dynamics simulation in particular is critical:  applications range from the practical, e.g., drug design, to basic research in understanding disease processes.  The overall goal is to give the Molecular Dynamics user community the compute capability to conduct transformative research via scalable, cost-effective, high-performance, general-purpose systems built from off-the-shelf components.  The objective of this research is to bridge the many orders-of-magnitude gap between the largest current simulations and the potential physical systems to be studied.\r\n\r\nThree fundamental issues limiting performance are (i) computational efficiency per chip area, (ii) power density, which is reaching the limit of economical cooling methods, and (iii) the bottleneck between processing and communication devices.  All three are addressed by Large-Scale Reconfigurable Computing using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  FPGAs are commodity integrated circuits whose circuitry can be configured, or programmed, in the field.  Their reconfigurable architecture gives them the ability to obtain maximum efficiency for a particular application while at the same time drawing less than a quarter the power of a conventional processing device.  And because FPGAs are the core components in internet routers, they are built to handle flexible high-throughput communication.  \r\n\r\nThis planning award is to investigate the novel system design to use the same FPGAs for communication and for computation.  This approach has several advantages.  First, it mitigates the critical bottleneck caused by the separation of functions among multiple devices.  Second, FPGA-based communication gives the flexibility either to use standard protocols, or to use innovative application-aware routing that enables important patterns, such as the Fast Fourier Transform, to be routed congestion-free.  Finally, FPGAs are well-suited for Molecular Dynamics computation allowing the hierarchical data-movement to be addressed through innovative routing, load-balancing, and arithmetic.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTogether with theory and experimentation, computer simulation now constitutes the third pillar of scientific inquiry, enabling researchers to build and test models of complex phenomena that either cannot be, or would be prohibitively expensive to be, replicated in the laboratory.  Applications range from the practical, such as designing more efficient aircraft and effective drugs, to basic research in understanding the molecular basis of diseases such as Alzheimer\u00c6s.  Yet computing capability is currently only a small fraction of what is needed:  detailed biological simulations are limited to small numbers of macro-molecules; additional factors of millions are needed to simulate cells and far more than that for larger structures.  The overall goal of this work is to give the Scientific Computing user community the capability to conduct transformative research via scalable, cost-effective, high-performance, general-purpose systems built from off-the-shelf (COTS) components.  The particular objective is to build a compute cluster and related infrastructure (called Novo-G#) that facilitates research that advances such computer systems. Specifically Novo-G# will be an enhancement of the Novo-G, an accelerator-based reconfigurable compute cluster housed at the University of Florida (UF).  The unifying technical mechanism to be explored is the integration of communication and computation in accelerator-centric clusters with direct and programmable interconnects.  The specific accelerator technology we are investigating is the FPGA: they are currently the only  COTS component that combines innate communication support, high-computational capability, low power, and an installed application base.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this work is derived from the novel technical mechanism underlying our system:  using the same FPGAs for communication as for computation.
