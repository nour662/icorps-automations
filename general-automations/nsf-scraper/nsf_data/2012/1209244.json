 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Yvonne Kung of Stanford University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Using computer simulations to develop more efficient materials for power lines,\" during the summer of 2012 at the National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan.  The host scientist is Ying-Jer Kao.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is increasing our understanding of materials with novel and potentially useful electronic properties, especially high-temperature superconductors, using computer simulations.  The research investigates strong electron-phonon coupling in strongly correlated electron systems by extending the tensor product state (TPS) method to fermion systems.  This additional computational technique allows the development of an overarching theory for strongly correlated materials.  An expected longterm outcome is to further understanding of high-temperature superconductors, which would potentially lead to decreasing power loss in electrical wires and revolutionize the power grid.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow with a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStrongly correlated electron systems give rise to novel properties that have the potential to revolutionize electronics, if we can understand how to tune them.  To name the most famous example, superconductivity is the ability to transport electricity without power loss below a certain critical temperature.  In other words, materials with this property offer an opportunity to revolutionize the power grid if we can understand the underlying mechanisms and harness them to develop room temperature superconductors.  Another example of strongly correlated materials is the manganites, which have a property known as colossal magnetoresistance, meaning that their electrical resistance changes dramatically upon application of magnetic fields.  Like superconductors, they could also become useful in circuit elements.\n\nHowever, thus far the critical temperature in superconducting materials, even the so-called high temperature superconductors, is still too low to be of use in the power grid.  Similar issues limit the practical applications of other strongly correlated materials, underscoring the importance of studying how properties such as superconductivity arise.  Unfortunately, these problems are too complicated to be solved exactly, and their complexity poses challenges even for powerful computer simulations.  A plethora of computational techniques have been developed to treat these problems, each with its own advantages and drawbacks.  Thus it is important for us to use as many methods as possible to study strongly correlated systems in order to understand their behavior.  To this end, we applied one technique, determinant quantum Monte Carlo (or DQMC), to the study of the cuprate high-temperature superconductors, and are in the process of developing another technique, tensor product states (TPS), to treat the same system.\n\n The first step in using DQMC to simulate the cuprates is to establish the parameter regimes for which the technique works best by mapping the fermion sign.  The fermion sign is a quantity that appears in the denominator of measurements, so that if it is too small, the measurements become unstable.  We have determined its values for a range of different temperatures and electron densities, as well as for different system sizes (sixteen copper atoms and thirty-two oxygen atoms, and thirty-six copper atoms and seventy-two oxygen atoms).  Knowing the parameter regimes in which to work, we have also calculated how changing the chemical potential controls the electron density, to check that the system is behaving as expected.  We have confirmed that as we lower the temperature, thermal effects decrease and we can see the Mott gap becoming more and more distinct.  In addition, we have studied the antiferromagnetic phase by computing the antiferromagnetic correlation function and by examining the correlation length.  As is known from experiments, the correlation function versus filling plot is asymmetric about half-filling and peaks increasingly sharply with decreasing temperature, indicating that antiferromagnetism is becoming stronger.  Our DQMC calculations capture this behavior.  In a complementary set of calculations, we also show that the correlation length (another measure of how strong the phase is) increases with decreasing temperature.  Finally, we have begun to compute another phase, the charge-density wave, so we can study the competition between different phases, as well as the Zhang-Rice singlet, a quantity thought to be connected to superconductivity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yvonne F Kung"
