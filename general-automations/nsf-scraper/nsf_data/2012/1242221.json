 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in July 1-10, 2013 at the School of Public Health at University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Brazil.  The principal investigator, Dr. Joan Rose (Michigan State University) will be joined on the organizing committee by scientists from the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela.  This PASI will engage 25 post-doctoral scientists, advanced graduate students and junior scientists and engineers from a diverse set of fields including environmental engineering, microbiology, environmental science, epidemiology, environmental health, veterinary medicine, and emergency preparedness.  Participants will gain hands-on experience with mathematical software and statistical approaches for addressing water pollution and control.  Additionally, the participants will attend lectures from top scientists in the field of quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), engage in specific exercises, and become familiar with probabilistic methodology.\r\n\r\nThis PASI will build upon the World Health Organization's recent publication that recommended that QMRA be used to implement the water safety plans by engaging more scientists and engineers from across the globe to gain experience with QMRA.  In addition, countries such as Brazil, Chile and Mexico are in a position to construct their water service systems implementing the new technologies that will be discussed and assessed in the institute.  Global access to program materials will be created via a website and contributions to the QMRA wiki.  Additionally, an environmental science and engineering career program will be developed to discuss post-doctoral scientists' pathways for engaging in water research, particularly in Central and South America.",
