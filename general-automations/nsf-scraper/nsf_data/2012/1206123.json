The research program focuses on jet physics, electroweak physics, Event Data Models and the development of Physics Analysis Tools.  The group is also active in the R&D program for the upgrade of ATLAS, including muon detectors, and provides leadership for US Collaborators on ATLAS in the domain of Tier 3 computing.  The Cal State Fresno program also provides an unusual opportunity for broadening participation through a consortium of thirteen CSU campuses.   Through this structure, the CSU Fresno group offers masters-level graduate students and undergraduate students the opportunity to work at CERN with CSU and international ATLAS researchers in a broad spectrum of research projects at the energy frontier of physics.",
