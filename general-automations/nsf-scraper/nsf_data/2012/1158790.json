 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit. This nano-related proposal requests support for development and application of a unified\r\ntheoretical approach to the thermodynamics and dynamics for fluids confined in porous\r\nmaterials. This unified modeling framework is expected to have major impact upon the materials\r\nscience and engineering of new porous materials and their use is many applications, ranging\r\nfrom catalysis, adsorption and membrane separations, to low-k dielectrics in microelectronics, to\r\nsensors and diagnostics in biotechnology. The theory being  developed, dynamic mean field\r\ntheory (DMFT), is fully consistent with the thermodynamics of confined fluids as described by\r\nclassical density functional theory (DFT). With DMFT one can take a model porous material in\r\ncontact with a bulk fluid and investigate the response of system to step changes in the bulk\r\nstate (chemical potential or pressure). The system evolves to a final state in which the density\r\ndistribution is also a solution of DFT for the system. The theory can describe\r\nadsorption/desorption dynamics for complex pore network structures, including the nucleation\r\nmechanisms for pore condensation and evaporation, as well as the dynamics of cavitation or\r\npore blocking. The theory can also be applied to mixtures, to study phenomena such as the\r\ndynamics of capillary condensation of mixtures or the dynamics of the displacement of one\r\nspecies in a porous material by another. The research project has the potential to be a\r\ntransformative contribution to the modeling of fluids confined in porous materials.\r\nThere are three components to the project: i) DMFT for fluids in pore networks. We will study\r\nthe mechanism for pore condensation/evaporation as well as cavitation for fluids in pore\r\nnetworks We will also study partial wetting and partial drying systems with applications to\r\ncondensation of water in carbon materials and to mercury porosimetry; ii) DMFT for fluid\r\nmixtures. We will study pore condensation of binary mixtures, including the effect of pore\r\nnetwork structures and nonideality in the mixtures. We will also consider dynamics of\r\ndisplacement processes such as in enhanced coalbed recovery of methane; iii) Further\r\ntheoretical development and assessment of DMFT. The investigators will test the accuracy of DMFT through\r\ncomparison with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics and Kawasaki dynamics simulations. The investigators\r\nwill also investigate the origin of symmetry breaking in the dynamics of nucleation processes.\r\nThey will study the explicit inclusion of fluctuations in DMFT and will also consider the utility of\r\nhigher order approximations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. While the research proposed here is fundamental in nature the potential\r\nimpact upon applications of porous materials is significant and affects many technologies. There is an enormous worldwide\r\neffort on the materials science and engineering of new porous materials and DMFT provides a\r\nnew approach to understanding the dynamical behavior of fluids confined in such systems that\r\nis consistent with the thermodynamic treatment from DFT. The research is transformative\r\nbecause it provides an approach to modeling confined fluids properties that treats\r\nthermodynamics and relaxation dynamics in a unified context. The research will help bridge two\r\nresearch communities in the area of confined fluid properties, one focused on adsorption\r\nisotherm measurements and thermodynamics and the other focused on transport phenomena.\r\n..\r\nThe project includes significant education and outreach programs including creating\r\nundergraduate research opportunities, including REU for students from community and four year\r\nstate colleges and enhancing the involvement of young researchers in international\r\nconferences the PI is organizing. The project also includes collaboration with industry\r\n(Quantachrome) and international collaboration (University of Leipzig).",
