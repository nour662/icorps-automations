 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Association of Biology Teachers is holding a Professional Development Summit meeting for two-year and four-year college faculty at its annual Professional Development Conference in Dallas in November, 2012.  The topic will be propagating the \"change\" implicit in the document Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action.  The day-long Summit features plenary sessions with noted speakers and leaders in education reform.  It includes an interactive workshop on \"Classroom Integration in the Introductory Biology Classroom,\" demonstrating practical management of this new approach to science education.  Interested participants then constitute a corps of faculty activated to transform aspects of their teaching during the following year, assisted by mentors from among the speakers.  This process gives visibility to the Vision and Change movement and a ripe audience to disseminate its mandates.",

A 2011 report prepared by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), \"Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action\" proposed a number of goals for biology education to best prepare students for the complex, science- and technology-driven society of the 21st century.

This project aimed to educate biology faculty from 2- and 4-year colleges and universities nationwide about the Vision and Change project, and further provide models for implementing Vision and Change strategies in their own classroom.</p>\n<p>To reach a nationwide audience, project investigators developed two intensive Vision and Change seminars (called \"Summits\") in 2012 and 2013, at the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) Annual Professional Development Conference.

The speakers included Dr. Susan Singer, one of the authors involved in the Vision and Change report, Dr. Jay Labov, National Research Council Senior Advisor for Education and Communications, Dr. Gordon Uno, head of the NSF-funded Introductory Biology Project (IRB), an effort to improve and standardize competencies and skills taught in introductory college biology courses, and Dr. Melissa McCartney, Outreach Manager for Science in the Classroom, an initiative of the AAAS flagship journal, Science, to make research articles accessible to science students.</p>\n<p>The 2013 conference featured a day-long follow up summit where faculty who had attended the first summit were invited to present on Vision and Change innovations that they had implemented since reading the Vision and Change report.
