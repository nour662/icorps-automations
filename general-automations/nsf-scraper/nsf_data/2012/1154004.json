The project emphasizes supporting students through formal and informal interactions with faculty and among students, seminars, and an opportunity for dedicated funds for their thesis research project, covering supplies and/or travel, when they become seniors.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The academic programs into which the students go are strong, and there are academic support activities.  The project targets attrition between the first and second year of college, and it provides incentives for students to declare and remain in a STEM major.  The project builds on a successful scholarship project that is just being completed.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The project is increasing the number and diversity of students who complete a STEM major and go on to work in the field or to further education.",

Reed has the highest rate of STEM graduates going to graduate school (38%), higher than any of the other well-known STEM-focused schools (like Harvey Mudd, MIT, and Cal-Tech) (<a href=\"https://www.cic.edu/resources-research/charts-data/reports/strengthening-stem-pipeline-2019\">https://www.cic.edu/resources-research/charts-data/reports/strengthening-stem-pipeline-2019</a>) (p.16). The goal of the current S-STEM grant was to ensure that this same level of achievement was met by students in historically unrepresented (socioeconomic, racial, and gender) groups. The broader impact of this project was focused on providing financial and intellectual support to promising undergraduates who have the potential to diversify and expand the pool of American science and mathematics professionals. The program was designed based on the hypothesis that direct and visible support of the student's scholarship would provide additional motivation to remain at Reed and pursue a career in mathematics and science. The intellectual merit of this program was to demonstrate that loan forgiveness for academically qualified undergraduates with financial need majoring in mathematics and science increases retention. In addition to financial aid, this grant included non-competitive student grants to support additional preparation for graduate school or STEM employment. Students were offered travel opportunities and additional expenses for the required senior thesis. While some students accessed these funds to defray the cost of graduate school exams or applications, others utilized the funds to attend workshops and meetings such as the mathematics workshop in UK Birmingham and the Green Chemistry Conference. Other examples of student opportunities included travel to CERN in Switzerland, a field research site in Namibia, and environmental monitoring in Holland. These are opportunities that would have been more accessible for a Reed graduating senior from an affluent family than for more financially challenged S-STEM Scholars. The grant had lasting impact on the college in terms of initiating several career mentoring programs now housed within the Center for Life Beyond Reed or supported by Reed faculty. These programs include grant-writing workshops, graduate school application seminars, public science events, and on-campus activities. The grant also helped to establish and support STEM student groups (pre-med and STEM GeMS). A full 50% of the students included in this program are now currently enrolled in graduate programs, and an additional 7% are in medical school. Another 10% are working as STEM teachers, and 21% are employed as programmers, researchers, or environmental workers. Of the students involved, 73% are female, 31% are first generation, and 52% are students of color. These are strong numbers in support of the S-STEM program at Reed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/02/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Susan&nbsp;C&nbsp;Renn</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
