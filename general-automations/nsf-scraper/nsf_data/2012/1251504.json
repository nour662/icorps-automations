This conference provides and opportunity for physicians, engineers, and health professionals to share their knowledge and issues, and to work together on innovative solutions. It is the only meeting specifically designed to outline the key engineering imperatives in medicine and biology for the next several years and work toward achieving this future.  The goal of this project is to facilitate meaningful involvement by students in all facets of the conference, from meeting planning to presentations and session leadership to post-conference evaluation.",
