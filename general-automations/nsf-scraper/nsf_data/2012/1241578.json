Thirty faculty scholars from  community and private colleges across West Texas are participating in a cyber-security education workshop and are mentored in the establishment of cybersecurity associate degrees and certification programs in their home institutions.  The project provides a holistic approach to cybersecurity education by integrating the science and engineering aspects of cybersecurity issues with the management, ethical, and practical aspects as they relate to national defense and homeland security. It also introduces recent advances in cybersecurity research to improve cyber security education and explores various technical research and educational challenges. The project is increasing the number of educators knowledgeable in cybersecurity, resulting in a multiplying effect to students including minority groups that contribute to the workforce in the region.",

It should be noted those who attended the second summer session at Texas Tech University are still being mentored as this year progresses.\n\nAugust 2013 Workshop consisted of 16 participants representing 11 institutions.  The participant demographics indicate we reached 9 men, 7 women, with specific ethnicity broken down into 4 African Americans (all female), 1 African (female), 3 Hispanic/Latino (1 female), and 8 White/Non-Hispanic (2 female).\n\nJuly 2014 Workshop consisted of 16 participants representing 14 institutions.  The participant demographics indicate we reached 9 men, 7 women, with specific ethnicity broken down into 2 African Americans (1 female), 1 Asian (female), 2 Indian (sub-continent) (1 female), 1 Hispanic/Latino, and 10 White/Non-Hispanic (4 female).\n\nAugust 2014 Workshop was a request weeklong presentation at Amarillo College.  Attendees included faculty, staff, administrators, students, and local law enforcement.  These workshop attendees included 29 attendees (4 female), 6 Latino, and 1 Native American (female).\n\nThese workshops built cyber security education capacity by reaching out to two and four year higher education institutions across western Texas.  The 20 schools reached with the program include:\n\nAbilene Christian University\n\nAlamo College\n\nAmarillo College\n\nAngelo State University (two faculty from the Computer Science department)\n\nAustin Community College\n\nEl Paso Community College\n\nHardin-Simmons College\n\nHouston Community College\n\nLone Star College\n\nLubbock Christian University\n\nLubbock Institute of Technology\n\nLuna Community College\n\nMcMurry University\n\nRanger College\n\nSouth Plains College\n\nSouthwest Texas Junior College\n\nTexas A&amp;M - Central Texas\n\nTexas State Technical College\n\nTexas Southern University\n\nVernon College\n\n2013 Workshop Subjects\n\nCybersecurity Fundamentals\n\nInformation and Data Security\n\nNetwork Security\n\nSoftware Security\n\nSmart Grid Security\n\nCyber Evidence and Forensics\n\nSoftware Security Education\n\nAfter a year of mentoring, assessment and evaluation we made some revisions to the 2014 schedule.  The changed topics for 2014 included: Increased TTU Graduate Student participation in 2014 through direct research presentations and offered \"hands on\" components.\n\n2014 Workshop Subjects\n\nNetwork Security\n\nWeb Security\n\nSecure and Resilient Software Development\n\nSmart Grid Security\n\nCyber evidence and forensics\n\nFundamentals of cybersecurity\n\nCapacity Building\n\nTexas Southern University: Planning on offering Cyber Security and administration of justice as new programs and incorporated information from the workshop by implementing security awareness in their software development degree. They have created a new course ITSY-1300\nFundamentals of Information Security.\n\nTexas State Technical College implemented more security awareness in their software development degree and their security degree is offering a new class on scripting. They also enhanced current lecture and lab content related to encryption, during Cyber-Security month they conducted digital security demonstrations, and provided handouts related to c..."
