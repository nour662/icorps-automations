 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Steven Folmar, Lisa Kiang, and Guy Palmes of Wake Forest University will investigate how the impact of social status on the mental health of adolescents in Nepal is affected by concepts of identity. Variation in the relationship between social status and mental health suggests that other factors, such as how individuals think about identity, alter this association.  This project will test the effects of two interrelated factors, education and 'cultural models of society' (how people view their membership in a status group), with one model held by individuals who believe that group identity results from an essential substance inherent in the members and the other model held by individuals who believe that group identity is due to societal factors that can be altered. \r\n\r\nThe project will employ a variety of social science methods, including extensive and detailed observations, and several standardized surveys and questionnaires on economic status, mental health and cultural models of society.  A total of 300 adolescents will be drawn from three groups: high status (high caste), intermediate status (ethnic group), and low status/caste (Dalit) with varying levels of education.  The project will be set in Lamjung, Nepal, which is characterized by sharp differences in social status and by rural-urban, educational, religious, political, and ethnic and caste diversity.\r\n\r\nBy investigating factors that alter how social status affects mental health, it becomes possible to shed light on the complex psychological processes of resiliency and internalization and how they relate to mental well-being.  The implications of this study apply to understanding the mental health costs of marginalization and the internal methods of coping, not just among low-caste groups in Nepal but among other marginalized groups around the world.  Results will inform policy on social discrimination and mental health in societies with marked social distinctions.  The project will also contribute to the science of broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science and is an excellent example of interdisciplinary scholarship.  The project stands to influence training in psychiatry, the planning and delivery of public health, and educational interventions in Nepal and elsewhere.  It will create opportunities for research partnerships between the U.S. and Nepal and will train students and researchers from both countries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe investigators of the project, \"Oppression and Mental Health in Nepal,\" are currently analyzing the rich sets of data collected.  Significant results pertain mainly to two areas.  One is the importance of understanding how gender and social status simultaneous impact identity and mental health.  The other that the methods we use to collect data on mental health are affected by our theories of culture and mental health, and have an impact on creating, not just measuring mental health, especially at the micro-level.\n\n1. The study of the intersections of social status, for example gender, caste and ethnicity, provides an important theoretical basis for understanding the role of culture in mental health.  It allows us to examine how variability within a culture; for example, it has been noted that although Dalits are marginalized in Nepalese society, Dalit women have been doubly marginalized.  Results of our project support this assertion, showing that Dalit females stand out as the most vulnerable groups among our participants, with significantly higher greater degrees of mental suffering than any other group.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, high caste boys are the most protected group, with anxiety and depression scores on the order of only 1/2 to 1/3 as severe as low caste girls.  But our results go beyond the conclusion that different markers of social status are simply additive.  The situation is much more complex, so when we include rural/urban residence into the mix, we see that living in rural areas can compound the problem for Dalit girls, and high caste boys, but not for high caste girls.  It appears that high caste boys are perhaps more vulnerable to assaults on their identity in urban areas where their privilege is threatened.  Therefore their mental health suffers because of the erosion of traditional values and practices that once supported their privileged positions.  Dalit girls experience more depression but less anxiety in urban situations, perhaps reflecting a mixed effect of urbanization, one that highlights the problems of being female and Dalit, but which contains hope for improvement in the future. \n\n2. Our methods of collecting data not only provide a measurement of mental health but also act to produce specific types of \"mental illnesses.\"  When we compared the results of different measures of mental health (called the SCID and BDI &ndash;for depression- and BAI-for anxiety), we found that one (the SCID) allowed us to include local concepts of mental health, its makeup and its causes.  Thus the SCID was able to reveal how such indigenous beliefs and practices, such as the belief in witches, is a key metaphor for indigenous understanding of mental suffering.  Perhaps more importantly, such belief serves as a mechanism for communicating that one is suffering mentally.  Indigenous ways of understanding mental illness also act as catalysts for bringing together a variety of social experience into a mental health \"encounter.\" The BDI and BAI leave no room for accounting for such indigenous beliefs and therefore can miss some of the mental suffering that occurs in indigenous situations.  The use of such instruments include another potential danger.  The way we conduct research helps to reshape the psychological terrain in areas where indigenous beliefs remain significant ways of comprehending psychological suffering.  By focusing solely on western-defined types of suffering, we contribute to the redefinition of mental health in non-western areas.  We, along with our research participants, in fact, contribute to the co-construction of mental illnesses that did not \"exist\" in the world views of the people we study prior to the initiation of such research.\n\nWe have reported these latter findings in a paper for publication: \"Research and the co-construction of mental illness in Nepal,\" now under review by Medical Anthropology Quarterly.  We have also made seven presentations of various aspects of the proje..."
