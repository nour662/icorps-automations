Tuttle of Washington State University, Pullman, WA to conduct a research project, entitled \"Investigating the control of wheat seed dormancy and germination by plant hormones,\" during the summer of 2012 at RIKEN Plant Science Center in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture.  The host scientist is Dr. Mitsunori Seo.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to advance knowledge about the hormonal control of wheat seed dormancy and germination by measuring hormones Abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), and jasmonic acid (JA) levels in seeds that are either dormant or subjected to dormancy-breaking treatments.  It is essential to advance knowledge about the hormonal control of seed dormancy directly in wheat where problems with preharvest sprouting of seed on the mother plant due to insufficient dormancy under cold or moist conditions cause economic losses for farmers.  Identification and localization of the hormone signal for dormancy release could transform current knowledge leading to new breeding strategies for preharvest sprouting tolerance.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of Japan; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally awareness of the U.S. scientific workforce.",

This has broadened the participation of underrepresented groups by providing the fellow, a female scientist, an opportunity to create new partnerships with Japanese scientists that is benefitting her both in her PhD research and future career.  She benefitted from access to state of the art technology at the RIKEN institute. She also gained invaluable insight from the cultural and scientific experience of performing research with Japanese scientists because this experience has enhanced her ability to develop collaborations and to conduct postdoctoral research with the same Japanese scientists.  As a PhD student in the Molecular Plant Sciences program at Washington State University, with a strong interest in hormone signaling and in Japanese culture, she was well qualified to conduct the proposed research.  The results of this research will be broadly disseminated through the publication of a peer-reviewed journal article in collaboration with Dr. Mitsunori Seo (Japanese host, RIKEN Plant Science Center, expert in seed dormancy and hormones), and through presentations to scientists, growers, and wheat breeders by Dr. Camille Steber (U.S. advisor, USDA-ARS Wheat Geneticist, expert on GA and ABA, seed dormancy) and the fellow.  Preharvest sprouting is a world-wide problem in cereals that results in wheat unfit for human consumption.  Therefore, this research will benefit society because knowledge of the hormonal control of wheat dormancy will lead to improved breeding strategies to increase wheat preharvest sprouting tolerance without creating problems with poor seedling emergence. \n\nPrevious research in dicots has firmly established that ABA/GA ratios control seed dormancy.

This study performed plant hormone profiling experiments which investigated the hormonal control of the transition from seed dormancy to germination in the cereal crop wheat.  To address whether the ratio between ABA and GA hormones control the dormancy status of wheat this project measured hormone levels in embryos/scutellum and in aleurone/endosperm from imbibed seeds in order to determine whether:  1) A..."
