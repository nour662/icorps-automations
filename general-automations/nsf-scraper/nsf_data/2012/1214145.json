 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Eric Ross and his group at Gonzaga University are developing new chromatography methods and materials for the evaluation of binding and partitioning events at lipid bilayers.  The materials under study are based on dynamic phospholipid phases supported on aggregates of silica nanoparticles which allow lipid bilayers and incorporated synthetic and natural receptors to be assayed in a nano-volume liquid chromatography format.  The high-performance features of the solid support and the dynamic properties of natural membranes that are replicated in the phospholipid coatings promise to extend the capabilities of current biomembrane affinity stationary phases to probe the influence of membrane and solution composition on the function of natural or synthetic pores and channels within lipid bialyers or to screen substances that modulate their function.  Project goals include structurally and chemically optimizing the stationary phases for the support of lipid bilayers and functional embedded receptors, optimizing chromatographic procedures for studies of membrane partitioning and binding with key model receptors both natural and synthetic, understanding the separation mechanism associated with ion-channel functionalized membranes, and establishing the compatibility of the system and format with increasingly complex biomembrane systems.   \r\n\r\nAdvances in research-enabling, cost- and time-effective technology that can be used to investigate factors affecting the strength and selectivity of interactions at biomembranes have the potential to broadly impact scientific fields that study this crucial biological interface which is hampered by the various analytical limitations of existing model systems.  Engagement of undergraduate students in all aspects of the research project beginning as early as the sophomore year and continuing through graduation will provide structured and advanced training in applied materials and bioanalytical sciences for students largely from rural areas of the inland Northwest.   Multi-year engagement on collaborative projects will allow undergraduate researchers to engage in vertical mentorship roles as they grow in scientific skill and ability.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMeasuring the strength of interactions between substances and cell membranes under biologically relevant conditions is important for scientists seeking to understand factors that contribute to membrane structure and function.  The complexity of the cell membrane and the dynamic, sometimes delicate nature of one of its major components, the lipid bilayer, present challenges for many of the analytical approaches to studying these interactions.  Some important interactions, such as those between the membrane and electrolyte components of biological fluids, are too weak to be reliably studied with the techniques most commonly used to study biological binding. \n\nThis research served to advance technology useful for the study of certain interactions with lipid bilayers, particularly those of electrolyte substances.   An outcome of this project is the development of materials and methods shown capable of measuring low-affinity binding between lipid bilayers and biologically important metal ion species using a technique called chromatography.   A common form of chromatography relates interaction strength to the length of time that a dissolved substance takes to pass through a column packed with solid particles that are modified with the binding partner. The material developed is a solid particle system that provides a large and smooth surface area which supports lipid bilayer structure and facilitates high accessibility to binding substances under study.  Prior studies with lipids supported on solid particles have used commercial, synthetic materials that have rough surfaces and a pore structure that impacts the properties of the lipid membrane.  This research has revealed the effect that different particle structures have on the measured interaction between common lipids and metal ions and clearly demonstrates the importance of the solid support on chromatographic studies with lipid bilayers.  A format for analyzing these interactions utilizing microscale columns and nanoscale volumes was developed that reduces lipid material consumption by several orders of magnitude over precedent studies.  The sensitivity of the methodology allows evaluation of metal binding affinity to minor membrane components which projects its application to the study of critical membrane components such as ion channel proteins.\n\nA broader impact of this research is the in-depth scientific and technical training of thirteen undergraduate research students.  Seven senior research theses were produced.  At project?s end, eight students were accepted or applying to medical or nursing programs, three were employed in scientific industry, and one was in a graduate program in chemistry.  Four of the students came from rural communities.  Additional training impact was realized through the creation of a four-week project related to this research that was developed for an advanced biochemistry laboratory course taken by all institution biochemistry majors. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/07/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Ross"
