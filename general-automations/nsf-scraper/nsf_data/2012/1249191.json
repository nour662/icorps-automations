 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed antenna system has the potential to allow simple implementation of Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Roadside Infrastructure (V2V/V2I) systems with low-cost, low profile, and enhanced electrical performance.  The antenna system includes specific feed network which  meets the automotive mechanical and manufacturing requirements.  Such feed network allows relatively lower installation complexity for new vehicles during the manufacturing stage and more importantly, it enables aftermarket retrofit, where the antenna system with ground plane independent characteristic allows flexible installation at different positions of the vehicle (i.e. on the roof of the vehicle, in the headliner, or on the dashboard). In essence, the proposed antenna will facilitate the advancement of vehicle safety through communication technologies and contributes to DSRC standards in supporting potentoal vehicle safety implementations especially after the amendment of the IEEE 802.11 standard into 802.11p which regulates the frequency range of 5.85 - 5.925 GHz for DSRC allowing high data rate communications and low power level requirements.\r\n\r\nThe proposed antenna system is significant to public safety as it will add to the advancement of vehicle safety using Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  ITS aim to streamline the operation of modern vehicles, manage vehicle traffic, assist drivers with safety and other data by providing convenience applications for passengers.  From a commercialization prospective, considering 80 million vehicles enter the market every year, market penetration will strongly influence the effectiveness of V2V/V2I safety and non-safety applications.  Studies have shown that it can take decades to reach 95% DSRC transponder safety device penetration in the global automobile market, even if all new vehicles are equipped during the manufacturing stage itself.  This antenna system will lead to enhanced \"V2V and V2I communications\" as it is desirable for vehicle antennas to have the lowest possible profile in order to avoid cosmetically altering the vehicle's exterior look and to allow easy and quick installation.",

Dr. V. Devabhaktuni led the I-Corps team and shared the commercialization learning with faculty/students (those without I-Corps grant).\n\n \n3. Customer Interactions\nThe principal investigator and the entrepreneurial lead from UT teamed up with the I-Corps mentor from IST, Inc. to study the technology commercialization feasibility for the candidate antenna system. Throughout and after the I-corps workshop which was held at Ross Business School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, our team carried out 70+ interviews with potential customers through physical face-to-face meetings; teleconferences; as well as communications via mail.\n\n \n4. Outcomes of Technology Commercialization Investigation\n\nDuring the I-Corps workshops at the University of Michigan, we were able to learn several terminologies and concepts required to establish a new start-up business. We also were able to estimate the market size for the candidate antenna system, build our initial revenue models, and define our distribution channels and key partners. After spending six months (July to Dec. 2012) of exploring the commercialization feasibility of the candidate antenna system and after interviewing over 70 potential customers, our decision was NOT to continue further with this product for several reasons as listed below:\n\n \n\nThere is an interest in our technology from the automotive industry and antenna original equipment manufacturers, however, a viable demand in the automotive market is expected to occur in about 4 to 5 years and research and development is needed to develop a sophisticated product using our antenna so that it can be sold/licensed as an integrated product and not as a separat..."
