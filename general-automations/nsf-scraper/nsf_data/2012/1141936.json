 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a detailed, molecular level characterization of dissolved organic carbon and microbes in Antarctic ice cores. Using the most modern biological (genomic), geochemical techniques, and advanced chemical instrumentation researchers will 1) optimize protocols for collecting, extracting and amplifying DNA from deep ice cores suitable for use in next generation pyrosequencing; 2) determine the microbial diversity within the ice core; and 3) obtain and analyze detailed molecular characterizations of the carbon in the ice by ultrahigh resolution Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). With this pilot study investigators will be able to quantify the amount of material (microbial biomass and carbon) required to perform these characterizations, which is needed to inform future ice coring projects. The ultimate goal will be to develop protocols that maximize the yield, while minimizing the amount of ice required.  The broader impacts include education and outreach at both the local and national levels. As a faculty mentor with the American Indian Research Opportunities and BRIDGES programs at Montana State University, Foreman will serve as a mentor to a Native American student in the lab during the summer months. Susan Kelly is an Education and Outreach Coordinator with a MS degree in Geology and over 10 years of experience in science outreach.  She will coordinate efforts for comprehensive educational collaboration with the Hardin School District on the Crow Indian Reservation in South-central Montana.",

Polar ice cores have become a powerful tool to help reconstruct past changes in the Earth\u00c6s climate, and have provided detailed records of temperature, precipitation, chemistry and gas composition of the lower atmosphere. Additionally, with ice cores we are able to identify volcanic eruptions, solar variability, sea surface productivity, anthropogenic emissions, and a variety of other climate and biogeochemical indicators. The data provided from ice cores has proven to be invaluable in our understanding of past and present climate processes. In addition to the incredible range of materials preserved within ice cores, ice provides a unique habitat for microbes and other biological material to reside, and until recently have received little attention. \n\nWe wanted to examine microbes in a deep Antarctic ice core, but this has traditionally been limited by the amount of ice available.  Imagine, an ice core that is five inches in diameter, you can cut this core into thin slices giving a glimpse back in time, but as soon as you decontaminate the outer surfaces of the core and melt it you are left with very little sample for analysis. Deep ice core samples are difficult to obtain and are quite precious, therefore each sample is potentially shared with other investigators in order to maximize what we can learn.\n\nThis pilot project took advantage of a deep ice core drilling technique known as replicate coring to collect an ice core in parallel with the main ice core from the multi-investigator West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide project (www.waisdivide.unh.edu).  The replicate core provided us with a larger sample volume which allowed us to investigate the role of microbes in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide Replicate Core (WDRC). We had three main aims with this work, 1) to optimize protocols for collecting and analyzing DNA from deep ice cores; 2) to determine the microbial diversity within a sample from the WDRC; and 3) to determine appropriate protocols and detection limits for characterization of the organic matter in the WDRC through ultrahigh resolution Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS).\n\nWe found that strict care must be taken to decontaminate ice cores so as not to analyze contaminants.  With each analysis technique very stringent controls must be employed so as not to amplify DNA or characterize carbon that may have come from sample processing or filtration steps.  We learned that if you do not remove filtration, amplification and sequencing blanks you run the risk of reporting organisms present in the ice core that are not really there.  As the field of sequencing becomes more sophisticated it is no longer \"good enough\" to run a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and report these results. \n\nAs we move forward, an understanding of the abundance, diversity and physiological state of microbes in ice will clearly help interpret the paleo-record in past and future ice cores.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis project allowed two female scientists and a female graduate student the opportunity to work in the ice core community. Biological work on ice cores is inherently challenging, primarily because of the low abundance of microbes in ice as well as the very high risk of contamination.  Protocols were developed to optimize DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing of microbial ice bound communities. Concentrations of dissolved organic matter are also quite low in ice, thus this project provided training in the analysis of carbon in ice, pushing the edge of what can be detected and analyzed using ultra high resolution mass spectrometry.  \n\nThe post doc and the doctoral student were involved in all aspects of the experimental design, ice core decontamination and analyses. A Native American undergraduate student participated in the ice core preparation. \n..."
