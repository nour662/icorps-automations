 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project analyzes more than three decades of data on U.S. scientists and engineers to examine the career dynamics of Ph.D. scientists and engineers.   \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The current textbook explanation for gender differences in labor market outcomes among older workers, including (if not especially) scientists, is that women tend to fall behind men as they choose a less career-oriented work-family balance or as the effects of discrimination in promotion accumulate over the course of a career.  Recent work finds the opposite to be the case when individual workers (or scientists) are followed over time.  Women tend to earn less than men from a very young age, but tend to be on a similar, or even faster, growth path than men.  The low average earnings of older women are predicted by their low earnings at labor market entry.  The research examines whether Ph.D. scientists and engineers (either as a whole, or within subsets defined by field of study) tend to follow patterns similar to the highest-paid scientists at the bachelor's or master's degree level, as opposed to the overall patterns observed within samples of somewhat less educated workers, or whether new patterns of career dynamics are yet to be discovered. This study leads to new knowledge about the dynamics of career progress, the role of working long hours, and how these processes vary by gender and race. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: Benjamin Franklin made tremendous contributions to science and technology without devoting his entire life to science.  Today, many scientists work long hours per week in an environment of intense competition.  If particularly talented individuals with the potential to make enormous contributions to science are either discouraged from becoming scientists, or train to become scientists but do not receive the support that will allow them to do their best work, an opportunity is lost to all.  Indeed, the 1981 Congress requested a periodic evaluation of the status of women and underrepresented minorities in the science and engineering workforce. The improved measurement and understanding of labor market processes and outcomes generated by this research should inform policies to efficiently promote gender equity, scientific productivity and the retention of talented scientists within a population of workers in whom we as a nation have invested enormous resources.",

It is also well known that, in the broader population, women tend to devote fewer hours per week to labor market work than men.  However, the relationships between hours worked per week and gender have never received systematic, scientific attention in a population of Ph.D. research scientists.  The goal of this research project is to learn as much as possible from information contained in the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR)&mdash;a longitudinal survey conducted by the National Science Foundation 20 times between 1973 and 2013, with individual scientists followed from the time they complete their Ph.D. training over the course of their careers.  To set this work into context, gender differences within the full U.S. population are also described.\n\n \n\nThis project was funded as a pilot study to assemble the data from 20 individual SDR surveys into a single panel data set, and to investigate whether further analysis of these data describing the careers of Ph.D. scientists and engineers seems to be a promising avenue of research.  I also pursued study of labor market dynamics within the full U.S. population, with particular attention to changes over time in labor markets for highly educated women.  During the course of the pilot study, I have identified a number of research questions that I hope to continue to investigate.  I also have several interesting preliminary findings:\n\n \n\n1) Previous research by Paula Stephan has documented that Ph.D. research scientists tend to work more than 50 hours per week.  I have discovered that this is true of both women and men employed in tenured or tenure-track jobs at U.S. research universities.  While the average number of hours worked per week has been declining within the full population of U.S. workers since the mid-1990s, the typical workweek among Ph.D. scientists at U.S. research universities has gradually increased, and is has reached 55 hours per week for both men and women (see Figure 1).  The upward trend is stronger in some fields than in others.\n\n \n\n2) The panel data set I constructed makes it possible to observe individual workers both before and after they attain tenure.  This enables me to answer a question I was curious about:  Do weekly hours of work drop off immediately after tenure?  I found that working a very high number of hours per week is the norm both before and after attaining tenure: Among all tenure track faculty observed both before and after tenure between 1995 and 2013, hours worked per week averaged 53 in the survey immediately before obtaining tenure, and 52 in the survey immediately after obtaining tenure.  Among those employed at a research university hours were higher, averaging 55 hours per week in the survey immediately before obtaining tenure, and 54 in the survey immediately after obtaining tenure.  Looking over a longer interval reveals that post-tenure workweeks remain about one hour per week shorter than pre-tenure, but that Ph.D. scientists tend work nearly an extra day per week compared to typical U.S. men both before and after tenure.\n\n \n\n3) The panel data set allows me to learn whether individual women who are observed working full-time at one point in time are likely to have been persistent full-time workers over the course of their careers.  Limiting my attention to individuals who were surveyed at least five times by the time they reached age 60, I can see that those women who ever worked full-time were full-time workers 85 percent of the times they were observed.  This share did not change over time.  However, the women were about twice as likely as the men to have at least a short spell of time when they were not working full-time.  Therefore, understanding the consequences associated with temporary reduction in hours worked per week in the context of a long-hours scientific career is a promis..."
