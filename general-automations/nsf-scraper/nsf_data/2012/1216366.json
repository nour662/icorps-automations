 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to investigate multi-level preconditioning techniques for solving linear systems of equations, placing a high emphasis on robustness issues. One of the key concepts used in these methods is that of coarsening, i.e., the method of reducing a set of variables of a system (called `fine' unknowns) to a smaller set (called `coarse' unknowns) which yields a good representation of the fine set. So far, coarsening has been viewed mostly from the angle of algebraic multi-Grid. A number of multi-level ILU type techniques, primarily based on coarsening ideas, will be studied. The research team will also investigate a new set of Multi-Level Low-Rank approximation techniques within Domain-Decomposition type methods. A number of factors make these methods very appealing, including their robustness and their potential effectiveness on  high-performance computers, e.g., ones employing GPGPUs. Finally, in an effort to tie the development of preconditioners more closely with applications, the research team will consider methodologies for developing what may be termed `application-tailored preconditioners.'\r\n\r\nThough enormous progress has been made  in the last two decades in the solution of large sparse linear systems of  equations  by iterative methods, the state-of-the-art of these methods remains unsatisfactory in  many areas. Foremost among these is the lack of robustness of iterative techniques in dealing with a variety of real-life problems. Recent research on Preconditioned Krylov Subspace Methods (PKSMs) has aimed at achieving a good compromise between generality and efficiency by incorporating techniques  from different horizons, including multilevel concepts to improve scalability and adopting ideas from direct solution methods to improve robustness. At the same time that these improvements are being deployed, the demands on developers of iterative  solution methods are changing. Applications have become much more challenging, and new computational environments are making obsolete complex software that often took several years to mature. The aim  of this research proposal is to address new challenges and questions that have emerged for PKSMs in recent years as well as to explore more common research issues where progress is of vital importance. All general use codes that will be developed under this project will be freely distributed under the GNU public use license. The PI already has a long practice with distributing codes in this fashion. This project will have an impact on the training of graduate students in a field that is vital to the needs of academia, industry, and government laboratories. At a time where  there is a significant upsurge of demand for specialists in computational mathematics, the number of graduate students trained in this broad area has diminished. The PI will place a major effort in attracting and training students in topics related to  scientific computing and high-performance computing. Because it is important to sparkle the interest into these areas at an early stage of the student career, the proposal highlights plans for employing two undergraduate summer interns to work  on specific  topics of this proposal, throughout its duration. Among other training activities the PI will continue the practice of freely disseminating books, lecture notes, and MATLAB scripts for educational purposes.",
