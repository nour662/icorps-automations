 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a renewal of an existing ocean acidification (OA) grant supporting an interdisciplinary research team (called OMEGAS) with expertise in oceanography, ecology, biogeochemistry, molecular physiology, and molecular genetics. Research to date has documented a dynamic oceanographic mosaic in the inner shelf of the California Current System (CCS) that spans 1,200+ km and varies at tidal, diurnal, event, and seasonal temporal scales at local to ocean basin spatial scales. In OMEGAS II, the project seeks to better understand the drivers of this striking time-space variability, and to link the OA seascape to the physiological and ecological performance of a key member of this ecosystem, the mussel Mytilus californianus. In addition, the investigators will explore the influence of this oceanographic mosaic on species interactions and community organization. As a dominant habitat-forming species, strong interactor, and major space occupant, M. californianus is arguably the core component of the rocky intertidal ecosystem along the upwelling-dominated CCS. Using an interdisciplinary, spatially extensive approach integrating inner shelf oceanography with ecology, physiology, and eco-mechanics, the interdisciplinary team will study the response of juvenile mussels M. californianus to OA. The studies span levels of biological organization, thereby allowing assessment of how the cost of forming a shell under field conditions might influence physiological performance and resistance to predation. This investigation will include modeling to link to larger-scale ecosystem and oceanographic dynamics in the CCS and beyond.\r\n\r\nResults from OMEGAS I show that the growth, survival, and shell strength of mussel larvae are strongly negatively affected by elevated pCO2, and that growth of adult mussels varied among sites within regions and between regions. Emerging data on natural variability in seawater conditions will allow a deeper exploration of the organismal response of M. californianus, and the ecological consequences of traits, such as reduced shell thickness and strength. The present project will expand and strengthen the existing oceanographic network to increase our understanding of the coastal OA regime, and provide the environmental context for ecological and physiological research. Specifically, this project will (1) conduct field and laboratory experiments on the influence of OA on the growth, shell accretion, and resistance to predation of juvenile mussels collected from 10 sites spanning 1,400 km of coastline, (2) link the OA-sensor oceanographic \"backbone\" to an existing database of community structure via ecological modeling to assess the influence of OA on coastal variation in community organization, (3) determine the physiological responses of juvenile mussels following field deployments and culture under common garden conditions to evaluate mechanistic underpinnings to the responses observed in mussels from different sites, (4) explore the physiological and transcriptomic response of mussels in lab mesocosms to field-documented variability in pCO2, and (5) using modified ROMS models, evaluate the linkage between basin-scale oceanography and local-scale variation in inner-shelf oceanography to evaluate the relative influences of large-to-local scale factors on OA variability. This research aims to understand how coastal ecosystems will respond to OA, and thus to develop our capacity to predict the future impact of OA on coastal ecosystems.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. This project will leverage complementary funding for research, training and outreach, and engage undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, as well as PIs. Part of an overall goal is to increase the visibility and familiarity of OA science for policy makers and the general public. Outreach will be facilitated through extensive ties to COMPASS (Communication Partnership for Science and the Sea), public lectures, websites, and multimedia outlets, such as films and television. Each campus is engaged in local-to-national displays on OA.",

COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Acclimation and adaptation to ocean acidification of key ecosystem components in the California Current System &amp; COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: OMEGAS II - Linking ecological and organismal responses to the ocean acidification seascape in the California Current System (CCS).  Intellectual Merit. A group of 13 PIs created a US west coast consortium to investigate the impact of ocean acidification (OA) on key components (sea urchins, mussels) of the CCS. Goals were to test the genetic and physiological responses of urchins and mussels to temporal and spatial variation in OA across multiple sites located in four regions from Oregon through southern California, and to quantify the coastal OA mosaic using deployments of newly developed pH sensors. Growth of sea urchin larvae in laboratory cultures was negatively affected by OA, but effects were small; the larvae were relatively smaller, a change that was associated with shifts in allele frequencies of 1,000s of genes, suggesting a strong adaptive capacity. In contrast, mussel larvae cultured at 2100 pCO2 levels grew weaker, thinner, and smaller shells and less tissue than control individuals. A multi-site pH and pCO2 sensor network across 1200+ km of the CCS in the intertidal and adjacent inner shelf revealed that (a) pH and carbonate saturation state vary regionally and latitudinally, (b) upwelling reliably generates low pH/high pCO2 water in some areas but not others, and (c) pH variation is likely a product of both physical and biological processes with diel variation ranging between ~8.1 to ~7.6.  \nBroader Impacts.  The grant has provided total or partial support for 8 research assistants, 2 research interns, 3 postdoctoral scholars, 3 staff, and 1 RET teacher.  At least 11 graduate student theses are based wholly or in part on the OMEGAS project.  OMEGAS PIs (Hofmann, Blanchette, Chan, Hill, Gaylord, Sanford, Menge, Barth) have been involved in international, national, and regional workshops, committees and partnerships focused on OA (e.g., GO-AN, Global Ocean Acidification Network, Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry OA subcommittee, ORAP OA Task Force, C-CAN, Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell Banks NMS, NOAA National Climate Assessment). Briefings for local stakeholders, congressional delegations, and governors of states have been presented (Chan, Barth). Invited lectures on OA have been given at \"Ocean in a High CO2 World meeting,\" the Ocean Sciences 2012 meeting, AAAS 2012, National Shellfisheries Association meeting (2012). NSF also invited our participation in their exhibit at the Feb 2012 AAAS meeting.  Collaborations for data sharing and sensor deployment exist with the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER, the Channel Islands National Park, the NOAA Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary, and BOEM, and the Ocean Change Center at UCSB (Hofmann, Director) has worked with the State Water Board to extend this collaboration to the state level.  Thirty-two talks and posters have been given at scientific meetings, with more scheduled for 2013 and 2014.\nPublications. The consortium has generated 22 publications and has 6 in preparation.
