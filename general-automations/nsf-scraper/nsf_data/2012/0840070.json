 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to produce a documentary film that would chronicle the return to Antarctica after 50 years of two men who first deployed to Antarctic as part of the original Deep Freeze missions in the late 1950's at the dawn of the scientific era of Antartctic exploration.\r\n\r\nPhotographer Morton Beebe--who as young naval officer served as Press Officer to  Admiral George Dufek, commander of the U.S. Navy Operation Deep Freeze I, II and III--and New Zealand author and journalist Geoffrey Lee Martin--who covered the historic Commonwealth Trans Antarctic Expedition, as well as Operation Deep Freeze and the International Geophysical Year (IGY) for The (London) Daily Telegraph, the New Zealand Herald--will produce the film as a personal reflection on the technological and scientific advances made in Antarctic exploration and experimentation since the IGY.\r\n\r\nThe two will interview key researchers and scientists, reflect on their own early expeiences on the continent, and offer insights into the critical role that Antarctic exploration and scientific research continues to play in human efforts to understand and cope with climate change on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe film will be produced from the perspective of two men who were involved in Antarctic exploration during its infancy with the intent of educating young people about the changes that have taken place between the IGY and the recently completed International Polar Year (IPY).\r\n\r\nThe film is designed to reach an audience that is largely made up of younger generations who increasingly get their information from the web and from television specials aimed at delivering a large amount of information in a relatively short period of time.\r\n",
