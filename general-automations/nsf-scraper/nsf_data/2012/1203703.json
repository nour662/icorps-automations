 "awd_abstract_narration": "An \"International Conference on Cycles in Graphs\" will be held at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee from Wednesday, May 30th to Saturday, June 2nd, 2012.\r\n    \r\nGraphs are abstract mathematical models of networks, and graph theory forms an essential part of the theoretical background for much of our modern information infrastructure, and for many modern methods of optimizing activities such as scheduling and transportation.  Cycle problems appear in many places, including in questions of great practical importance such as the Traveling Salesman Problem.\r\n    \r\nCycles are a fundamental topic in graph theory, and this topic has many subareas, including conditions for hamilton cycles and their generalizations; pancyclicity; circumference; cycle decompositions; cycles in graphs with algebraic structure; cycle double covers; weighted cycle problems; cycles in random, sparse or dense graphs; and cycle spaces.  Recently there have been significant advances in a number of these subareas, and it appears to be an opportune time to gather together workers in this area to share ideas.  This conference should allow participants to review recent progress on important open problems, determine the best directions for further work, and discuss possible new avenues of investigation.\r\n    \r\nThe conference will be held in conjunction with the annual Shanks Lectures hosted by the Department of Mathematics at Vanderbilt University.  The Shanks Lecturer will be Daniela Kuehn of the University of Birmingham, in the United Kingdom, who will give two fifty-minute talks as part of the conference. There will be six additional principal speakers, each giving one fifty-minute talk, namely Alan Frieze (Carnegie Mellon University), Penny Haxell (University of Waterloo, Canada), Deryk Osthus (University of Birmingham, UK), Kenta Ozeki (National Institute of Informatics, Japan), Paul Seymour (Princeton University) and Xingxing Yu (Georgia Institute of Technology).  Other participants will give contributed talks of twenty to twenty-five minutes.  We anticipate about 120 participants, and about 80 to 90 contributed talks, arranged in two or three parallel sessions.\r\n    \r\nThe local organizers are Mark Ellingham and Paul Edelman of Vanderbilt University.  More detailed information about the conference may be obtained from the web site, \r\n        <http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~shanks2012/>.\r\n    \r\nThis proposal supports attendance by principal speakers and other participants, particularly targeting those without other sources of federal support, early career researchers, women, disabled persons and minorities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n    An \"International Conference on Cycles in Graphs\" took place at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, from Wednesday, May 30, 2012 until Saturday, June 2, 2012.  This was held in conjunction with the 27th Annual Shanks Lectures at Vanderbilt University.  The conference location was the Stevenson Center of Vanderbilt University. The local organizers were Mark Ellingham (the principal investigator) and Paul Edelman.\n\n    The conference focused on the area of cycles in graphs.  This is a fundamental area of research in graph theory, but there has not been a meeting specifically dedicated to this topic for the past ten years, or perhaps longer.  The conference featured eight plenary talks by seven distinguished speakers, as follows:\n\n *  Daniela K&uuml;hn (University of Birmingham, U.K.) was the Shanks Lecturer, and gave two talks;\n *  Alan Frieze (Carnegie Mellon University);\n *  Penny Haxell (University of Waterloo, Canada);\n *  Deryk Osthus (University of Birmingham, U.K.);\n *  Kenta Ozeki (National Institute of Informatics, Japan);\n *  Paul Seymour (Princeton University); and\n *  Xingxing Yu (Georgia Institute of Technology).\n\n    There were also 68 twenty-minute talks (with five additional minutes for questions) by other speakers.  These talks ran in two parallel sessions throughout the conference.  The talks covered many different topics on cycles in graphs and closely related areas.  The conference seems to have been a definite success and to have achieved its goal of allowing participants to see some of the most important new developments in the area.\n\n    Most of the National Science Foundation (NSF) funding was used to provide travel support to participants who requested support via an application process.  22 people were supported in this way, including 8 graduate students and 6 postdoctoral fellows.  NSF funding also paid for some of the expenses of the plenary speakers, and a small amount was used to pay parking expenses for participants in general.\n\n    The conference web site may be found at\n        http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~shanks2012/\nThe \"Program\" link provides an outline of the program, with clickable links to abstracts of talks.  The \"Slides for Talks\" link leads to a page where files containing slides for some of the talks (submitted by participants on a voluntary basis) may be found.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark N Ellingham"
