 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the research activities of Professors Jonathan Bagger, David E. Kaplan, Marc Kamionkowski, and Kirill Melnikov at Johns Hopkins University.\r\n\r\nThe interests of the Johns Hopkins theory group touch on most of the dominant areas in modern theoretical high-energy physics and cosmology.  In this project, the theory group aims to tackle central problems at the juncture of theory and experiment in particle physics and cosmology.  It plans to advance new ideas for cosmological observations and particle physics searches, develop and exploit new calculational tools needed to discriminate new physics from Standard Model backgrounds, and propose new mechanisms and models that may ultimately help in the grand synthesis of nature's laws. \r\n\r\nThis project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  This proposed research will provide a training ground for graduate students and postdocs.  The Hopkins group also plans to continue their work disseminating the results of physics research in order to attract young students into STEM careers.  Bagger has produced a planetarium show in collaboration with the Maryland Science Center that has been viewed by over 85,000 people in four countries, and plans to continue his activities in this direction.  Kaplan co-hosted a season of the \"Known Universe\" on the National Geographic Channel;  he also plans to continue creating a feature-length documentary to capture the ramp-up, start-up, and first significant data release of the LHC.  All four PI's also plan to continue working with the Hopkins QuarkNet program, aimed at connecting Baltimore high school teachers and students with physicists engaged in cutting-edge research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe aim of particle physics is to understand the fundamental laws of physics, the rules that govern the behavior of all physical systems in the Universe.  The traditional avenue for progress in this endeavor has over the past century been experiments at particle colliders, the most recent such experiment being the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a major international collaboration with significant US participation.  Another avenue has been to use observations of astrophysical systems, as well as the Universe as a whole, as a laboratory for fundamental physics, as these cosmic systems must also obey the laws of physics.  Research on this subject advances the national interest by promoting the advancement of science in its most fundamental direction.  It also advances the national interest by attracting young talent to STEM fields and providing them with powerful analytic tools and thus driving the type of innovation that drives economic progress.  \n\nDuring the past three years, the Hopkins Particle Theory group has, with the support of this grant, advanced these aims in a number of ways.  Bagger and his students investigated new mathematical structures,that follow from supersymmetry and extra dimensions.  These ideas provide new ingredients for particle physicists to use in the effort to construct new theories that aim to answer some of the current mysteries in our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics.\n\nKaplan and his students and postdocs used novel mathematical structures to construct several plausible theories for new fundamental physics.  They explored, for example, what the consequences of supersymmetric theories could be for experiments done at the LHC and elsewhere.  They also proposed a new mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking, or in plainer language, the origin of mass---i.e., why do elementary particles weigh?  In the proposed mechanism, the mass is determined in part by the cosmic evolution of fundamental quantum fields since the big bang.\n\nQuantum field theory is the fundamental mathematical tool for describing the interactions of elementary particles.  Although the basic principles have long been understood, theorists are still developing techniques to derive efficiently quantitative predictions that can be tested against measurements.  Melnikov developed several new and advanced several existing techniques to bring the calculational capabilities of quantum field theory to the stage required for a detailed understanding of the results of experiments like those at the LHC.\n\nKamionkowski and his students and postdocs focussed on the identifcation of new ways to use astrophysical measurements to test different hypotheses about new laws of physics.  This work involved ideas for the dark matter that holds individual galaxies together, the dark energy that drives galaxies away from each other, and for the early evolution of the Universe.  Much of this work involved the development of new ways to use data from measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the relic radiation from the big bang, and forthcoming galaxy surveys in novel ways.\n\nAll of this research was carried out in collaboration with graduate students and postdocs who worked with the co-PIs as apprentices and journeymen, respectively, in research.  Several of the students and postdocs supported by this grant will evolve into independent scientists and teachers, while others will apply skills acquired in the course of this research to power the nation's economic development in careers outside of science.  The Co-PIs also had impact outside of scientific research by participating in programs for continuing education for high-school teachers.  Co-PI Kaplan moreover has brought the human drama of the quest for scientific knowledge to a huge audience through his production of the documentary film, Particle Fever.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marc Kamionkowski"
