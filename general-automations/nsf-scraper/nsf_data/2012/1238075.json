 "awd_abstract_narration": "ICOPS is an internationally renowned, well-attended conference involving topics of direct interest to the NSF, Universities, DOE, Air Force, and many others. The meeting is sponsored by the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society (NPSS). ICOPS has been held annually since 1974. Recent meetings were held in Chicago IL (2011), Norfolk VA (2010), San Diego CA (2009), Karlsruhe Germany (2008), Albuquerque NM (2007). This year's meeting will be held in Edinburgh Scotland UK at the early July 2012. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the PI is projecting an attendance of approximately 700 participants. It is anticipated that 25% will be Government/Federal attendees and 75% will be non-federal attendees. The conference will include plenary, oral, and poster sessions on research in plasma science and technology and a Prize Addresses by the recipients of the the IEEE Marie Shklodowska-Curie Award and the IEEE NPSS Plasma Science and Applications Committee Award. Oral sessions will include both invited and contributed papers. Invited papers are allotted 25 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for questions. Contributed papers are allotted 12 minutes for presentation and 3 minutes for questions. The ICOPS Minicourse is on Plasma Medicine and Health Care.\r\n\r\nApplications of plasma technologies are expanding in many new areas for materials processing, lighting, environmental protection, and medical research and treatment. All of these technologies depend on a strong underpinning of basic research traditionally supported by our meeting. The program of the 39th ICOPS will emphasize both the traditional areas of plasma science and these new areas of growth through the plenary talks and the regular technical program. \r\n\r\nThis award provides funding to partially support student travel grants, particularly for underrepresented minorities, activities to promote women in engineering, and help in awards costs. The travel grants will be awarded to those students who will be presenting papers (oral talks and posters) as first authors.",
