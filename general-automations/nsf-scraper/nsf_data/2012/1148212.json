Most of these investigations utilize in-situ produced cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al in quartz, due in part to the ubiquity of this mineral, and in part because of the availability of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) sample preparation protocols that are accessible to the earth science community.  Since the development of the method, measurements of 10Be and 26Al in quartz have been used to provide empirical constraints and answer fundamental outstanding questions throughout the fields of geomorphology, climatology, archaeology, ecology, seismology, and geophysics.  This investigation will develop a routine, robust standardized approach for measuring multiple cosmogenic nuclides in the iron oxide, magnetite, providing a powerful new tool for earth scientists working across many disciplines.",
