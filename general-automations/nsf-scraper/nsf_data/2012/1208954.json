 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds David Carson Jinkins of Penn State University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Quantifying the extent that Chinese consumers signal well-being with consumption decisions,\" during the summer of 2012 at Peking University in Beijing, China.  The host scientist is Dr. Yaohui Zhao.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is in measuring the extent that consumers buy goods to show others how well-off they are.  Previous research has uncovered broad trends in American consumption data which are consistent with a simple signaling model.  This project uses a more fully specified model to measure  the importance of signaling to both American and Chinese consumers.  This approach allows the measurement of welfare losses due to signaling, to estimate welfare gains from excise taxes, and to compare the importance of signaling in the United States and China.        \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

Along with telling time, my watch makes me look professional.  Vacations to exotic locates are an enjoyable way to show my friends that I can afford vacations to exotic locales.  Economists have observed that consumption is both direct and social for a century.  My research aims to tease out  just how much people care about these two components using detailed data on household expenditures.  \n\nMeasuring how much people care about the social aspect of consumption has important implications for tax policy.  An important finding in my paper is that luxury taxes on the most visible types of goods--jewelry, clothing, cars, etc.--can make some people much better off without hurting anyone.  My results show that taxes on cigarettes, for instance, should be even higher than their current level.\n\nA second goal of my research is to use cross-country differences in household expenditure data to identify differences in preferences for social consumption.   Observations in the popular press as well as survey-based marketing literature have found that Chinese consumers care more than Americans about the social aspect of consumption.   I estimate my model on actual spending data in the United States and China, and find that indeed Chinese consumers care twice as much as Americans about social consumption.  While American households would give up one-sixth of their well-being from direct consumption to be thought twice as well off by their peers, Chinese households would give up one-third of their well-being.  \n\nThat preferences for social consumption can vary so much internationally has practical implications for the marketing strategies of companies selling products in multiple countries.
