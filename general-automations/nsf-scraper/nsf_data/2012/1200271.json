 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project \"Moduli of Abelian Varieties\" is on the Hecke symmetry of these moduli varieties over a field of positive characteristic p. Over fields of characteristic zero the Hecke symmetries govern modular forms and their higher dimensional generalizations, and p-adic properties are often reflected in the geometric properties of these symmetries in characteristic p. Hecke symmetries which fix a given point in a moduli space give rise to the local stabilizer subgroup of the given point. The action of this group on the local moduli space contains crucial information about the Hecke symmetries in general. However it was unclear how to extract these information in the case of positive characteristic p. Recently the PI made some progress in the first non-trivial case of the above general problem, and found what can be thought of as an asymptotic expansion of the action of the local stabilizer subgroup in the case of two-dimensional Lubin-Tate space in characteristic p.  The PI proposes to extend such asymptotic expansion to other moduli spaces, and to show that every Hecke orbit of a point in the generic open Newton stratum is dense in certain modular varieties associated to unitary groups. The latter problem is known as the Hecke orbit conjecture, which was inaccessible before. This proposal also contains two projects related to Hecke symmetries over fields of characteristic zero.  One of them continues the PI's prior supported research on CM lifting; the other is related to another supported research on aspects of the Andrea-Oort conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe concept of symmetry originated from our basic aesthetic sense and is of fundamental importance in modern science. In mathematics the major source of symmetry is crystallized by the abstract definition of a group. The main object of study in this proposal is a certain families of systems of polynomial equations admitting a large collection of symmetries, called Hecke symmetries; they are of fundamental importance in number theory. In the proposal, the PI establishes an approach which will reveal certain hidden pattern about the Hecke symmetries not previously known. It is expected that these patterns will enable us to solve many cases of an open problem known as the Hecke orbit conjecture.  This approach to a qualitative understanding of these symmetries is completely new since the work of Lubin and Tate in the middle 1960's.",

For instance the moduli spaces of one-dimensional abelian varieties, known as modular curves, are crucial to the celebrated proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Wiles and Taylor via the arithmetic of modular forms.\n\nThe most prominent feature of a moduli space of abelian variety is the presence of a very large collection of symmetries, known as Hecke symmetries.  The classical approach to modular forms reflects the geometry of moduli spaces over fields of characteristic 0.  Over fields whose characteristic is a prime number p, the geometry of moduli spaces exhibits additional features, called fine structures, which strongly influence the p-adic properties of modular forms.  These fine structures in characteristic p are preserved by prime-to-p Hecke symmetries.  Previous work of the PI on prime-to-p Hecke symmetries on a special class of modular varieties, known as Hilbert modular varieties, provided the geometric input necessary for a theorem of Hida, which is a significant advance in number theory. Further progress on Hecke symmetries of modular varieties will be applicable to a wider range of questions.\n\nThis project has produced two major advances in the geometry of modular varieties in positive characteristic p and their Hecke symmetries.  The first is the discovery of a general phenomenon, which translates into a new notion of \"sustained p-divisible groups\".  This concept elucidates the nature of a class of special subvarieties of modular varieties, called \"central leaves\", and led to further insight on the local structure of central leaves.\n\nThe second advance is the proof of a local rigidity theorem for a class of central leaves in modular varieties.  A special case of this theorem was proved by the PI in 2004, but whether that phenomenon holds for more general central have been a puzzle.  The PI made a break through in 2017 and proved that local rigidity holds in the first non-trivial case not covered by the previous result.  The key new ingredient of the proof is a class of \"generalized formal functions\". It is likely that this new method will lead to a proof of the local rigidity result for all central leaves.\n\nOther outputs of this project include (a) the discovery of an unexpected phenomenon in liftings of abelian varieties, documented in a 2014 PhD thesis of Taisong Jing supervised by the PI, (b) a weak asymptotic expansion for the action of the local stabilizer subgroup on the deformation space of an abelian variety, also in Jing's PhD dissertation, (c) the discovery and investigation of an integrable system which comes from a non-linear partial differential equation.\n\nBroader impacts:\n(a) The PI supervised a 2014 PhD dissertation by Taisong Jing which contains significant contributions to arithmetic algebraic geometry.\n(b) The part on background materials in the monograph \"Complex Abelian Varieties and Lifting Problems\" with Conrad and Oort, published in 2013, has become the preferred source for graduate students on complex multiplication.\n(c) The PI has published five survey articles on topics in arithmetic algebraic geometry, totaling over 180 pages, for the benefit of non-experts and young researchers. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ching-Li Chai"
