 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Smithsonian Institution is awarded a grant to construct a multiuser amphibian research laboratory adjacent to a pre-existing amphibian conservation center developed by the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation project at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute's Gamboa field station in Panama. The facility will provide research space, live animal laboratory space, and quarantine space to be used by in house staff, visiting scientists, students and volunteers.  The addition of an amphibian research laboratory on the site will support research across numerous disciplines with a focus on utilizing the adjacent living collection of highly endangered amphibians. The new amphibian research laboratory will build critical capacity to improve the quality of existing NSF-funded collaborative research and open up new possibilities for such collaborations. The lab may facilitate multidisciplinary research in a wide range of areas, but disease mitigation research countering the devastating effects of the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in Panama will be prioritized. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the project will be the growth of in-country capacity to research and counter amphibian declines throughout Latin America and provide a venue to foster hands-on experience for the scientific training of young scientists both in the US and Panama.  In addition, the existing educational network associated with the project will help to leverage significant exposure for research conducted in the new lab both in the USA and Panama, and help to foster people-to-people awareness between the USA and Panama.

The newly constructed 1,415 square foot research building significantly improves the pre-existing amphibian breeding center and expands our abilities to conduct research using the valuable living collection of endangered amphibians established by the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project as a partnership between the Smithsonian, the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, Zoo New England and the Houston Zoo. These amphibian species have experienced rapid disease-related declines in the wild and represent a valuable living resource for future research in the areas of animal husbandry, veterinary science, disease research, conservation, genetics, reproduction, animal welfare, nutrition and more. The new building includes a 168 sq. ft. quarantine room for housing and treating diseased frogs and a 200 sq. ft. laboratory for research experiments. The building also includes office space for 6 staff and 2 visiting researchers, a toilet, shower and storage space. The new space improves our capacity to offer and conduct research internships, handle volunteers and minority students. &nbsp;The new building also features a 250 sq. ft. exhibition niche accessible to the public with bilingual interpretation explaining the importance of amphibian biodiversity, conservation and research to visitors and passersby.
