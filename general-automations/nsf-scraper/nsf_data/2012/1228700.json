 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focused on the creation of new techniques and algorithms to support comprehensive analysis of Android applications.  We have developed formally grounded techniques for extracting accurate models of smartphone applications from installation images.  The recovery formalization is based on TyDe, a typed meta-representation of Dalvik bytecode (the code structure used by the Android smartphone operating system).  In developing TyDe, we are formalizing the TyDe type inferencing, ill-formed bytecode structure management, and creating a generalized Dalvik-to-Java retargeting logic based on bytecode \"instruction templates\". \r\n\r\nTyDe and the models they represent are being used to perform deep analysis of application structure to infer potential application behaviors that may harm users, their data, or the cellular or Internet infrastructure.  In particular, these analyses support whole program analysis, reflection, and smartphone specific data flow analysis.  Such analyses provide a means for evaluating an applications adherence to best security practices or organizational requirements by inspecting permission structures, component interfaces, and source code and library origins for signals of malicious behavior.  The analysis techniques are being evaluated on a large corpus of real-world applications extracted from real application markets.  \r\n\r\nIn the broadest view, this work is providing new avenues for researchers, industry, and consumers to assess potential dangers presented by applications retrieved from smartphone application markets, an advancing the state of the art in application program analysis.",

Moreover, a leading participant in the early stages of this project was hired by Google to develop and employ techniques (including those generated as part of this project) to evaluate smart phone applications entering the Google Play market.  In this way, the results of this project are now being used to protect the single largest source of smartphone applications on earth.  Indeed, many of the best practices used by the industry on evaluating the security of applications were and continue to be influenced and informed by the tools and analyses we developed within this project.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick D Mcdaniel"
