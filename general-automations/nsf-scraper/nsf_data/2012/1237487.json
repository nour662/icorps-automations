 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding savanna vegetation dynamics in East Africa under different off-take methods and precipitation regimes\r\n\r\nSavanna vegetation comprises a large percentage of the total land surface area in East Africa and savannas are important for the sustainability of millions of livestock keeping pastoralists and wildlife. The ecological processes underlying the dynamics of savanna vegetation are the result of interactions between moisture, nutrients, fire and herbivory. The objective of this research is to rely on experimental field studies, which incorporate more real-world conditions, in order to better understand vegetation dynamics of savannas, specifically, how the method of vegetative off-take matters for regrowth.  The investigation will utilize experimental treatments through enclosures across a precipitation gradient within the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem of East Africa. This project will contribute new knowledge on how savannas might be impacted in future generations and addresses the implications of these changes for the sustainability of people, landscapes and wildlife. \r\n\r\nThis research will have a direct bearing on conservation and development policies, contributing to new knowledge and the development of policies which more fully consider the real world conditions affecting savannas. The project will enhance the participation of underrepresented groups by training local Maasai peoples in ecological monitoring and evaluation. The project will also benefit undergraduate students from the University of Michigan and the University of Nairobi who will be part of a yearly study abroad effort to understand the ecological dimensions of conservation and development strategies in East African savannas.",
