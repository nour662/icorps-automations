 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building upon the current green/renewable energy grant from the U.S. Department of Labor and the highly successful NSF S-STEM Scholars Program, the Leading Innovation through Green High Tech Engineering & Sustainability (LIGHTES) project is enhancing and expanding ongoing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) collaborations with five regional high schools, the College of Engineering at Stony Brook University (SBU), and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The goals of the LIGHTES project are to: (1) create new and revised alternative energy/green technology courses to enrich the Electrical Technology (ELT) and Engineering Science (ENS) degree programs; (2) develop a sequence of articulated green technology teaching and learning experiences that reach from high school to the baccalaureate level on Long Island, thus increasing the pool of skilled ATE graduates for green/sustainable technology careers; and (3) collaborate with NSF ATE green technology grantee, Bristol Community College (BCC), to establish a community of practice. \r\n\r\nThe collaborative activities with BCC are: (1) designing new alternative energy/green technology associate degree options by developing four new ELT and ENS courses and modifying four existing ELT and one ENS course; (2) forming a community of practice among STEM faculty at both institutions; (3) mentoring high school science and technology teachers at regional high schools using green technology workshops; (4) providing new student internships at BNL and SBU; (5) creating new pipeline activities among engineering faculty at the college, SBU and Hofstra University; and (6) integrating green technology education with the S-STEM college scholarships award. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project is using or adapting existing exemplary green technology, energy, and sustainability curricula developed by BCC and other NSF- and Department of Energy (DOE) -validated sources. Curricula are being developed by an experienced interdisciplinary team of engineering science, engineering technology, and mathematics faculty and validated by an Advisory Board comprised of scientists, academic faculty, and industry representatives. Curriculum, activity, and exercise methods are being guided by evidence-based practices including inquiry-based and problem-based learning. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: In keeping with national trends, New York State (NYS) is stepping up its commitment to green industrial growth. Approximately 50% of the 250 green businesses operating in NYS are located in the metropolitan New York City/Long Island area. A well-articulated pipeline from high school to baccalaureate degree-granting institutions is needed to engage greater numbers of STEM students to meet current and future local and national workforce needs in green and sustainable energy. The college is establishing a community of practice with BCC, creating a new 2+2+2 STEM pipeline in the Long Island region guided by a regional Advisory Board, engaging high school teachers and students in LIGHTES activities, and disseminating the project results at national ATE conferences. A peer-reviewed publication is planned to disseminate results and add to the STEM education knowledge base.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSummary\n\nSuffolk County Community College (SCCC)'s LIGHTES Project - Leading Innovation through Green High-Tech Engineering&amp; Sustainability - focused on infusing sustainable/green energy concepts and understanding into the Engineering, Mathematics and Science courses on its three campuses.  The overarching goal of the LIGHTES project was to prepare green energy electrical technicians and engineers to meet regional and national workforce labor needs while increasing the STEM student pipeline.\n\nSuccesses have included the development of sustainable energy-infused math, science and engineering course modules, formation of an advisory board which has provided on-going guidance, courses for underrepresented pre-college students and summer workshops for their teachers.  Specifically, engineering, pre-calculus, meteorology and geology courses were redesigned; new alternative energy, green building and research methods courses were created.\n\nOver the three-year project period, the LIGHTES curriculum impacted 250 engineering students and 1,466 college STEM students for a total of 1,716 college students.  In addition, 587 pre-college students from districts with large underrepresented populations were engaged in LIGHTES activities.  In total, the project engaged 14 college faculty, 26 pre-college faculty and 2,303 students in sustainability and green energy concepts and career awareness activities.\n\nAdditional outcomes are listed below.\n\nThe Long Island Alternative Energy Consortium (LIAEC http://liaec.aertc.org/), a cooperative effort by seven Long Island public and private colleges and universities(Stony Brook University, Farmingdale State College, SUNY Old Westbury, SUNY Maritime, Nassau and Suffolk County Community Colleges, and the New York Institute of Technology), is working with public and private entities (including Brookhaven National Laboratory), to ensure that students obtain the knowledge they need to work in the rapidly evolving energy industry.  This collaboration is the beginning of a broad interdisciplinary focus on energy issues.  The ultimate goal is to boost the Long Island economy and contribute infrastructure jobs in the energy sector.\nLIGHTES students formed a Technology Club through which they implemented two projects on campus: solar lighting for a poorly lit walkway on campus and solar heating for a handicapped bus waiting area.\nThe LIGHTES project accelerated College efforts to create a culture of sustainability.  A new administrative Office for Sustainability was created.  This will provide additional campus-based active learning opportunities for future energy students.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nLIGHTES concentrated on courses and degree paths in Engineering, and courses in other STEM disciplines such as Mathematic, Meteorology and Geology.  Impacts and changes to pedagogical methods in these STEM areas were significant.  By developing and infusing sustainable energy curriculum/theory into the Engineering programs we have enhances the student educational experience.  Solar PV provided a large scale physical model with which students can experiment to understand technical concepts.  It provides a large scale \"active learning\" lab experience, allowing students to practice technical and 21st century skills such as technical equipment.  Most importantly, students are empowered as they apply their theoretical learning to a technological system that has the potential to solve problems impacting society.  For example, students work in teams of two to build and design small electrical circuits at electronic stations and report on their findings.  Next, they design a sustainable solar PV system that can serve a residential dwelling.  Working in larger teams of five or six they plan, develop and construct a working system.  Student teams keep track of successes, challenges and failures throughout the process and report team findings to the entire class.  This simulated design, prototype build and testing in industria..."
