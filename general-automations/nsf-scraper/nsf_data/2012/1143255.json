 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in the development of novel ultrafast, highly selective, high permeability ion-exchange fiber composites for removing perchlorate from drinking water.  The proposed technology removes perchlorate 10-100 times faster than the best currently available options, and employs a low-cost production method compatible with widely available manufacturing equipment.  Rapid contaminant removal is made possible by the use of micron-scale mass transfer distances; whereas commonly used beads and granular media are limited to much larger sizes because of significant drawbacks including difficult containment and enormous pressure drop, fiber composites display both high permeability and self-containment due to their permanently intertwined, self-supporting structure.  Serionix will demonstrate feasibility of this new technology through the following activities: 1) preparation of active resin/substrate fiber composites using a spray-casting method; 2) characterization of perchlorate-removal efficiency in both continuous and intermittent flow configurations; and 3) research and development of pretreatment methods to replace the current processing solvent (acetone) with water and to improve composite wetting properties.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this research is the development and commercialization of a low-cost technology enabling regulatory compliance and improved protection of human health. The EPA is set to regulate perchlorate in drinking water by 2014.  This application represents only the first commercial opportunity for a platform technology with the ultimate potential to transform the industrial and residential water treatment landscape.  Future applications may include ultrahigh efficiency water deionization, softening, and industrial wastewater recycling, personal protective equipment and clothing, and high activity solid acid/base catalysts. Dissemination of data and interpretation will contribute to improved understanding of mass transfer characteristics in fibrous sorbent materials used in both water and air treatment.",
