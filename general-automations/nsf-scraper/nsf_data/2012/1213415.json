 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Dr. Rebek of the Scripps Research Institute is funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program and is directed at harnessing the unusual behavior of molecules in confined spaces to perform a number of desirable tasks. The confined spaces are the reversibly formed capsules and the tasks comprise the control, acceleration and even catalysis of reactions inside the space. Capsules with chiral spaces will be applied in asymmetric synthesis and separation science. Capsules attached to surfaces built up through layer-by-layer self-assembly will \"write\" information on the nanoscale. Polymeric capsules will be prepared, characterized and evaluated as \"smart\" materials. These materials respond by expansion and contraction to changes in signals in the environment. \r\n\r\nThe majority of all medicines are synthetic small molecules that exert their beneficial effects by fitting into the small spaces of human proteins. This proposal intends to research the behavior of molecules in the small spaces inside synthetic containers. The size, shape and chemical surface of the containers are controlled by laboratory synthesis designed to manipulate the container and contained molecules to perform tasks. The tasks include reversible expansion like muscle movement, storing information like nanoscale computers and acting as reaction chambers as a laboratory flask. Students and postdoctoral fellows will be trained on how to perform research; these researchers are likely to move on to the nearby biotech and hightech industries. This project attracts high school teachers and students in the San Diego area. The Scripps outreach program on campus will manage these summer internships.",
