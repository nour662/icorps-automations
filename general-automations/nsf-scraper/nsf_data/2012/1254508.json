The ninth SOUPS will be held July 24-26, 2013 at Northumbria University in Newcastle, UK. The funds support travel grants for American students to attend the conference. SOUPS is the top conference devoted to usable privacy and security. By increasing student participation at the SOUPS conference, it may encourage more students to get involved in usable security research and pursue further graduate education and careers in this area.",
