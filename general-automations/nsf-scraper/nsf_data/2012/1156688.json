 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThis three year REU site program at Virginia Polytechnic Institute will provide students with a unique interdisciplinary research experience within an urbanizing watershed system in southwestern Virginia. Virginia Tech's Stream Research, Education, and Management Laboratory (StREAM Lab) will serve as the focal point for several interconnected group research projects dealing with issues of water sustainability and environmental stewardship. The Town of Blacksburg and Virginia Tech's campus are the primary upland sources of pollutant loadings to this otherwise largely forested and agricultural receiving water, providing students with the opportunity to directly observe the effects of urban stormwater on stream hydrology and water quality. As the REU participants address their specific research questions, they will be mentored by interdisciplinary faculty groups, which will provide them with a rich perspective on their target issues, as well as extensive networking opportunities. The undergraduate students will be encouraged to develop critical thinking and communication skills through a series of \"Society and Science\" evening lectures and discussions, and through the guided design of outreach activities intended to engage minority young children in summer science camps.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis REU site program will provide students with the interdisciplinary background necessary to address complex water sustainability issues during their future careers. In addition to exposing students to the diversity of related research in this area, this project will provide students with opportunities to communicate and interact with various stakeholders and the general public. Recruiting efforts will be guided by Virginia Tech's Center for Enhancement of Engineering Diversity (CEED) with a focus on recruiting students from non-research intensive institutions.",
