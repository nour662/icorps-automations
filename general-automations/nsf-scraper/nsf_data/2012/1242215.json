 "awd_abstract_narration": "Symbiosis, intimate associations among different life forms in nature -   is increasingly appreciated as a central biological phenomenon, with important effects on ecosystems, and the evolution of life on earth. Examples include ecologically important symbioses such as reef-building corals associated with symbiotic algae, and symbioses between land plants and fungi associated with plant roots. Human beings depend heavily on healthy symbiotic systems for productive crops and fisheries, insect controls, medicines, and ecosystem maintenance. This award will support participation by prominent American symbiosis researchers, as well as selected American pre-college teachers and graduate students in a unique international conference sponsored by the International Symbiosis Society, to be held July 22-28, 2012 at Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, Poland. Hosting symbiosis researchers from over twenty-five countries, the meeting will stimulate new ideas and new research collaborations, and include discussion of economic, ecological, and societal implications of symbiotic associations. International, interdisciplinary exchanges will be fostered not only through formal presentations of cutting-edge research, but also through numerous opportunities for informal person-to-person discussions. The Polish venue of the conference will further enhance potential international collaboration by enabling exchanges with central and eastern European scientists who have had relatively few opportunities to attend international conferences.  Focused themes at the Congress include the significance of partnership-building in evolution; how symbiotic systems may be applied in climate change adaptation; the role of fungal-plant associations in restoring toxic industrial waste sites; the human body as an ecosystem; and innovative ways to teach about symbiosis.  Special plenary lectures include a tribute to renowned symbiosis pioneer and thinker Lynn Margulis; a visual journey of Antarctica from a woman symbiologist who has based her research there over many years; and, the key roles of viruses in the biosphere from the perspective of a medical doctor.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe International Symbiosis Congress held at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland, July 22-28 2012 could not have happened at a better time.   In recent years, the field of symbiosis -- close and long-lasting partnerships among very different life forms in nature -- has been in the forefront of an emerging scientific revolution.  As the Congress further exposed, evolution, the biosphere, and even our own selves must now be seen and studied in new ways.  For example, one of the key symposium sections to the Congress was the human body\u00c6s partnership with a wide variety of microorganisms.  This symbiosis appears crucial and necessary to human beings being able to function and even survive.  Findings presented at the Congress further reinforced the notion that the human body needs to be seen as an ecosystem and not as an individual entity invaded by mostly harmful microorganisms.\n\n \n\nThe Congress featured more than 300 participating scientists from 30 countries.  It was dedicated to the memory of one of the pioneers in the field in symbiosis and one of the great thinkers and scientists in modern times, Dr. Lynn Margulis, who passed away unexpectedly several months prior.  She was best known for her reviving and then confirming the once ridiculed view that all life forms other than bacteria are the result of mergers of very different organism through symbiont acquisition.  No longer could evolving life forms be seen as only the result of gene mutations but often primarily through one organism engulfing another organism.  Her wisdom and spirit permeated the Congress meeting from the opening keynote tribute presented by her long-time friend and colleague Professor Douglas Zook of Boston University to the closing symposium on humans and microbes.\n\n \n\nOther key findings shared at the Congress included:\n\nHow various grasses worldwide contain bacteria and fungi known as \"endophytes\" and that these endophytes under certain situations allow the plant to be resistant to the effects of drought.  This has important implications for the future as an adaptation to climate change, wherein societies will need to promote new plant types for crops and ecosystem preservation in severe drying conditions.\nAn emerging new role for fungi known as mycorrhizae.  These fungi are symbiotic within or on the roots of nearly all plants, and some can even take up and reduce the effects of heavy metals present in the soil  Given the hundreds of metal-contaminated sites globally from  mining operations, this holds promise in that certain plants with the appropriate mycorrhizae may be able to grow effectively in such denuded regions, allowing for a restored environment.\nThe continuing data that show significant threats to marine ecosystems such as coral reefs.  Reefs are the direct result of a symbiosis between the coral animal cells and a microscopic alga known as a dinoflagellate.  These dinoflagellates have a limit on the sea temperatures in which they can remain viable.  With increasing sea temperatures, these algae are deteriorating and the coral is unable to build a limestone reef.  Such reefs are critically important for fish populations to lay eggs as well as for biodiversity overall.\n\n\nA unique feature of the Congress was an afternoon education session, in which symbiosis science experts showed the organisms with which they work and explained their research to the other Congress participants as well as visiting teachers and students from the Krak&oacute;w area.  Ten stations were set up allowing individuals and small groups to access the experts and their displays for important and engaging exchanges.\n\nKrak&oacute;w with its remarkable Renaissance architecture, strong arts and science environment, urban parklands, and hospitality proved to be an extraordinary site for the Congress, notwithstanding the fact that its main University features significant symbiotic research leaders who served as the host organizers.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/11/2013\n\n\t..."
