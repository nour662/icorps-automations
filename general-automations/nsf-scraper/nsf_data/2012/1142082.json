 "awd_abstract_narration": "Krill, Euphausia superba, is a keystone species in the Antarctic ecosystem and provides the trophic link between microscopic plankton and charismatic megafauna such as penguins and whales. Recent evidence suggests krill may not be exclusively planktonivorous, which introduces the potential of new pathways of carbon flux through krill based ecosystems.  A change in our view of krill from one of being herbivores to omnivores opens up several questions.\r\n\r\nClimate induced change in the extent, thickness and duration of overlying sea ice coverage is expected to change the prey fields available to krill, and to have subsequent effects on the suite of predators supported by krill. The nature of this benthic prey?krill link, which may be crucial in those parts of the seasonal cycle other than the well studied spring bloom, is yet to be determined.  DNA techniques will be used to identify and quantify the prey organisms. \r\n\r\nThis project will measure the in situ feeding ecology and behavior of krill and, ultimately, the success of this key species. An overall goal is\r\nto investigate seasonal changes in Euphausia superba in-situ feeding and swimming behavior in the Wilhelmina Bay region of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) area,  known to be a region of changing climate. Understanding the biological impacts of climate change is important to societal and economic goals. The project scientists will additionally team with a marine and environmental reporting group to design presentations for an annual journalist meeting.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the project period, the University of Massachusetts Boston group conducted 2 field cruises in the Antarctic Peninsula region in 2012 and 2013 (Fig. 1), synthesized data collected, produced 6 manuscripts on physical, biogeochemical and biological processes in the Southern Ocean, disseminated the results to diverse communities through 11 public seminars, and trained a visiting scientist from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 3 graduate students at the University of Massachusetts Boston, and 3 undergraduate students at the University of Massachusetts Boston participating in the cruises and sample analysis.  The major findings from this study are:\n\n \n\n1)      Krill autumn-onshelf and spring-offshelf seasonal migrations (Fig. 2)\n\nLarge dense krill aggregations found in Flandres, Andvord and Wilhelmina Bays reached an unprecedented density of 103-4 inds. m-3 in a horizontal and vertical scales of 10s km and 100s m, respectively. The krill aggregations reached a biomass over 1 million wet tones in each of these bays, and grazed most of organic particles within the water column.  Active feeding activities of these krill aggregations were also observed in the Gerlache Strait and open area of Flandres Bay where strong currents might bring fresh biota to these krill.  Most krill aggregations departed away from these bays and straits in Austral spring 2013 (Fig. 2B), and only a few of large adults remained.\n\n \n\n2)      The transition zone in the vicinity of the Gerlache Strait and Anvers Island between two water masses (Fig. 3)\n\nThe Gerlache Strait and its embayments are subjected to 2 dominant water masses, the warm MCDW intruded from the south through the Palmer Deep and southern entrance, and the cold BSW from the Bransfield Strait. The transition varies primarily driven by the strengths of intruding MCDW and BSW, and seasonal winds.  Presumably the Gerlache Strait alters between the warm MCDW dominance in the austral summer-fall, and the cold BSW dominance in the winter-spring.\n\n \n\n3)      Multiple driving mechanisms for spring blooms in the area  (Fig. 4)\n\nUpwelling and mixing between these water masses driven by katabatic winds can bring nutrients and dFe to surface waters to enhance potential blooms. In the late austral spring, warm MCDW and seasonally melting freshwater stratify the water column and the abundance of zooplankton is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of austral fall, both of which favor large spring phytoplankton blooms in the nutrient- and dFe-rich surface waters. Due to a lack of grazers during the spring, there are high fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) to the sediments from these blooms. Thus, the spring ecosystem is dominated by large phytoplankton blooms and low mesozooplankton and krill biomasses.\n\n \n\n4)      Control on intrusions of MUCDW into the Gerlache Strait by the narrow and sill near the southern entrance (Fig. 5)\n\nThe narrow and sill at the southern Gerlache Strait act as a control on the MUCDW intrusions into the Gerlache Strait.  In the south, the water types are predominated by the warm MUCDW in the depth, cold overwinter water below the mixed layer, and fresh surface water affected by melting water and precipitation, while in the north, the water types are predominated by the cold Bransfield Strait water in the depth, warm intruding MUCDW in the middle, and fresh surface water (Fig 3).    \n\n \n\n5)      Krill retention through interaction between circulation and krill behavior (Fig. 6)\n\nThe Gerlache Current plays a critical role in supporting the ecosystem in the Gerlache Strait and its embayments.   Not only the heat transported by the Gerlache Current into the Gerlache Strait and its embayments for keeping water from being frozen which is essential for marine mammals, but also providing food (i.e. detritus, aggregates and mesozooplankton).   The mesoscale jets and eddies in the Gerlache strait and its embayments provide the essential mechanisms for the retention of biota and food supplies. In all Andvord, Flandres and Wilhelmina Bays, the unique phenomenon is that krill aggregations were retained in eddies next to jets.    \n\n \n\n6)      Krill induced sediment fluxes (Fig. 7)\n\nConcentrations of particulates were measured by the LISST, LOPC and Flowcam.  Distributions of small particles less than 250 mm along a transect from the Gerlache Strait to Wilhelmina Bay in austral fall 2012 are shown in Fig. 7.  These small particles represent phytoplankton, aggregates and small mesozooplankton.  Higher concentrations of particles were also found in deep waters near the bottom.  Because the primary production during the late fall was extremely low, and most particles were grazed away by krill, these particles were presumably resuspended from sediments.  The tidal currents and deep circulation were weak in the bay while krill feeding on sediments were observed.   The resuspension was potentially caused by feeding and mixing of krill aggregations.  If this is proven true, the sediment fluxes of nutrients and iron, and overwintering strategies of krill can be rewritten.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Meng Zhou"
