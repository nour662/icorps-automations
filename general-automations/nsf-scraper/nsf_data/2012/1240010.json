 "awd_abstract_narration": "Delaware State University (DSU) in partnership with Delaware's Lake Forest and Red Clay Consolidated School Districts is recruiting 28 new highly-qualified, mathematics and science teachers for Delaware and surrounding states. The Phase I Teacher Scholarship Track program provides up to 3-years in scholarships for four cohorts of 7 DSU juniors and seniors majoring in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).  The scholarships help Noyce scholars complete their BS degrees in STEM disciplines and receive a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT). This program builds on DSU's NCATE-accredited teacher education program and the existing early field experiences partnerships with the Red Clay Consolidated and Lake Forest School Districts.  First year Noyce Scholars are introduced to teaching by pairing them with board-certified veteran mentor teachers for extensive field experiences. The Scholars also participate in Saturday round table meetings, and receive high-quality training in standards driven inquiry- and problem-based teaching, curriculum development, teaching with technology, and reflective practice. Further, Noyce graduates enroll in a First Year Teachers Seminar course at DSU and receive stipends for continued support and professional development during their crucial first year of teaching.",
