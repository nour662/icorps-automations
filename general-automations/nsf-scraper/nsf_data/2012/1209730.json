 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Marissa Jablonski of the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee to conduct a research project, entitled \"Modeling industrial scale removal of dyes from textile industry wastewater using readily available chemicals in containers made of garbage,\" during the Summer of 2012 at Beijing Normal University in Beijing.  The host scientist is Dr. Chenghong Feng.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the size, breadth, and sustainability of the study.  Modeling kinetics of photo-Fenton oxidation in 10-liter mobile units and detailing optimal chemical concentrations allows the process to be augmented ultimately to be implemented into larger scale dye houses throughout the global dyeing industry.  The proposed research uses alternate chemicals in the form of animal blood and reactors made of recycled plastic and scrap that lower the cost and make the process accessible to communities at very low cost and in any locale.  Once optimized, the process can work to clean dye wastewater from textile industries everywhere.  Many dye houses throughout the developing world dispose untreated dye wastewater directly onto lawns surrounding dye stations, leaving it to penetrate groundwater and contaminate drinking water with toxic chemicals and dyes.  Photo-Fenton oxidation offers a sludge-free treatment process to benefit those who currently use no treatment, cannot afford to use costly reverse osmosis systems, and are left to deal with hazardous sludge from biodegradation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
