  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe Arctic Observing Network Design and Implementation (ADI) Task Force Writing Workshop is a 3 day workshop that was held in Boulder, CO June 27-29, 2012. \nThe expected outcomes of the workshop were to  (1) jointly review the recently completed ADI Task Force community survey, (2) discuss and evaluate in the context of ADI two case studies for further guidance on observing system design and implementation, and (3) synthesize and jointly review the available documentation and draft sections of the report that address the ADI goals.\nThe over arching goal of the workshop and finalization of the report were to make recommendations for next steps in optimizing, coordinating, and enhancing the existing components of an international arctic environmental observing system with emphasis on the U.S. Arctic Observing Network.\nThe conclusions and recommendations of the ADI task force take into account the assessment of the present state and implementation plans of the AON, the synthesis of lessons learned from other observing systems, the identification and assessment of promising approaches for observing system design and optimization, and the results of the community survey.\nIn response to the unique challenges of AON design and implementation, the ADI Task Force, with input from the broader research community, developed a hierarchy of approaches for observing system design and optimization.\nThe six broad methodological categories for design and optimization include (1) integration through overarching projects, including impacts of change on human activities; (2) retrospective analysis and review of past work; (3)\necosystem services; (4) data thinning experiments; (5) model-based observing system experiments; and (6) observing system simulation experiments. The first three methodological approaches are mostly qualitative in nature and would be most suitable for observing goals that are less well-defined. The last three approaches are quantitative and model-based and require a greater level of understanding of the observing system design goals\nand the localscale expression of the processes that drive the observed change. Specific examples of how the different approaches could be applied to AON design were also provided in the report.\nBased on Task Force Conclusions and Recommendations, the ADI Task Force identified a number of key next steps that include (1) the compilation of an inventory of harmonized data from different agencies to improve data\ninteroperability, access to data, knowledge of data holdings, and support to modeling studies; (2) planning for an implementation of an AON Steering Group; and (3) steps towards prioritizing existing and future observing\nactivities according to a hierarchy beginning with Problem Definition, Strategy, Tactics, and ending with a Deployment Scale.\nThe final report is freely available to the public and is posted on the Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS) website, under the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/27/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karyn Sawyer"
