Ontogenetic and phylogenetic variation in extant brachiopod crura and loops\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\n\tOrganism shape is the medium through which the underlying genetic makeup of the organism interacts with the environment.  Only by studying shape and how and why it varies, can evolutionary biologists begin to understand the product of underlying genes/environment interaction.  Because shape is the primary source of heritable information from extinct (no longer living) organisms, paleontologists assume that the boundaries of shape variation correspond closely to clades (evolutionary entities), as implied by the hierarchy of rank-based taxa.  This assumption is seldom tested.  This research project will test the clade status of taxa recognized in extant Brachiopoda, one of the most paleontologically significant metazoan groups in terms of diversity and abundance for over half a billion years.  Roughly 95% of species are extinct; with the 5% of rhynchonellide and terebratulide brachiopod species extant (still living), we have a rare opportunity (1) to test molecular and morphological phylogenies at different hierarchical levels, never before attempted for this clade; (2) to compare the size and shape of functionally significant features, primarily features called crura and loops, among adults within and among species, and across growth stages; (3) to use this information to produce quantitative comparisons among adults and growth stages in crura and loops, and place the growth transformations in an evolutionary context informed by both shape and molecules. If paleontologists cannot reliably distinguish evolutionarily informative from significantly misleading shape variation, evolutionary interpretations drawn from the observed variation are fundamentally untestable. The results of this study on living brachiopods can have profound implications for macroevolutionary interpretations derived from taxonomic data on any group of extinct metazoans, in revealing problems associated with uncritically accepting untested assumptions of homology (shared common ancestry of features).\r\n\r\n\tAnalyses will be conducted on representative species of all living rhynchonellide and terebratulidine genera, and all lving terebratellidine genera for which molecular sequences have been made available, using parsimony and Bayesian analysis.  Growth variation in crura and loops will be quantified using geometric shape analysis on 3D images obtained from microCT scans of calcareous lophophore supports in living brachiopods.  Growth character polarity in crural and loop development will be compared with phylogenetic polarity using outgroup analysis.  Tree comparison methods will be utilized to evaluate patterns of qualitative and quantitative morphological character distribution, and to compare results from molecular and morphological analyses.  Total evidence analyses will also be conducted and compared with those derived from morphology alone and molecular sequence data alone.\r\n\t\r\n\tAlthough the word brachiopod is not a household word, as is clam or snail, brachiopods provide an excellent opportunity to study changes in morphology over lifespans and lineages, with enormous extinct diversity preserved in the fossil record and a smaller, more manageable diversity living today.  This research project will contribute to the education of undergraduate and graduate students through coursework in evolutionary biology and paleontology at UC Davis, and will support the training and mentoring of a female graduate student and female post-doctoral researcher.  We will take advantage of opportunities to share our research results with the public at Picnic Day (a UC Davis campus-wide annual open house) and the Explorit Science Center (City of Davis).  Three-dimensional images of brachiopods will be fully accessible on a website created to share the visual results of our research. We are beginning to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the development and evolution of morphology in vertebrate animals, yet our understanding of evolutionary morphology across a much more diverse array of marine invertebrate animals lags well behind.  Our research will strive to introduce and explain a portion of the fascinating paleobiological complexity of one group of marine invertebrates to the general public, and engage the public in discussions about the nature of evolution: recognizing, characterizing, and interpreting change over time.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merits:  Brachiopods are marine invertebrate animals; they have two valves, like clams do, but have a significantly different arrangement of their organs between those two valves, as well as different patterns of growth and development, physiology, and lifestyle.  They are very intriguing to biologists and paleontologists because they were extremely common and diverse (well over 30,000 species have been named) and among the most important components in marine benthic ecology for a long period of Earth history &mdash; more than half a billion years &mdash; and despite several major mass extinctions on Earth, there are still about 500 or so brachiopod species living today.  By studying living (extant) brachiopods, we can make much more informed inferences about how extinct brachiopods lived, and why and under what conditions so many became extinct, while a few others persisted to the present day.  Why have so many died out, while a particular few have survived?  What makes each group distinct?\n\n            The goal of this project is to answer the question posed by the title &ndash; we would like to find out to what extent changes in the size and shape of features important to living brachiopods, particularly in growth and development, have influenced their evolution, and why.  We have completed quantitative analyses of variation -- among adults, across stages in the life cycle, and across patterns of evolutionary relationships -- in size and shape of perhaps the most important feature in brachiopod biology &ndash; the mineralized support for the lophophore, which is the organ used for respiration, feeding, and releasing gametes and wastes.  We focused on the three most diverse groups of living brachiopods:  those with crura, short loops, and long loops.  These structures are geometrically complex in three dimensions, making them difficult to study and quantify by traditional means.  We were able to produce three-dimensional models from CT scans of brachiopods and analyze them with 3D geometric morphometric techniques, to determine quantitatively how these features vary and how they relate to one another geometrically.\n\n            Genealogical (phylogenetic) relationships among the brachiopods classified within and among these three groups were not known prior to the phylogenetic analyses of morphology (investigated by our group) and molecular data (collected by others) that we have now completed.  With this genealogical framework now established, we are able to investigate the relationship between changes in size and shape, over the life span of an individual animal, and put them in the broader context of evolution and phylogeny of all brachiopods.  Brachiopods with long loops pass through stages in their development that include crura, and then short loops, culminating in long loops as adults. We have now quantified in 3D the relationship between size, shape, age, and ancestry in these groups, and have determined that certain species with very small adults have truncated their development, retaining juvenile features of closely (or in some cases, more distantly) related species that are larger as adults (called paedomorphosis), and appear to have reached sexual maturity at an earlier stage of their lifecycle (ontogeny).  Over all brachiopods, a generally peramorphic (extended rather than truncated) developmental pattern emerges in their phylogeny. When morphological stages in a life cycle mirror similar stages in evolution, the process can be referred to as heterochrony, or the evolutionary consequences of changes in developmental timing and rate.  The ability to infer (or not) long-term evolutionary patterns from short-term developmental processes is a topic that has been debated in evolutionary biology for centuries.  Our studies have enabled us to test a wide range of specific hypotheses of heterochrony in brachiopods, one of the most diverse and abundant groups of marine invertebrates in Earth history, and will facilitate similar investigations by others on patterns in many other groups of animals.\n\n \n\nBroader impacts:  We are just completing a website with dozens of high-resolution models of 3D images of brachiopods that can be rotated and studied and downloaded for use in paleontology labs and research projects everywhere.   This project supported two female Ph.D. students, one a Mexican citizen and another later also as a post-doctoral scholar.  One is employed in the field of paleontology and the other is about to finish her Ph.D. this year.  One additional post-doctoral scholar has been supported part-time in the final year of the project.  He has developed a number of programs that are being used widely throughout the evolutionary biology community, and support from this project has made this type of scholarly activity possible.  We have each utilized the knowledge gained from this project in our various formal and informal teaching and other research activities, including my role as Faculty Director of the UC Davis CalTeach/MAST program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sandra J Carlson"
