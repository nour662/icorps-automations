 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to collect and analyze measurements of water vapor isotope ratios and ozone concentrations at the site of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observatory on the Chajnantor Plateau in Chile (23S latitude, elevation 5100m).  The measurements will be used to study the processes which determine the humidity of subtropical air masses, which are known to be more moist than region of the tropical upper troposphere from which they descend into the subtropics.  The site is ideal for making these measurements because it is one of the few places where air from the tropical upper tropopause can descend all the way to the Earth's surface without substantial modification during descent.  It is also an extremely convenient site given the research infrastructure already in place for ALMA.\r\n\r\nThe measurements address four questions: 1) What is the co-variability of water vapor and isotopic composition on daily, intraseasonal, seasonal, and interannual time scales? 2) How do upper tropospheric processes set the aridity of the Southern Hemisphere relative humidity minimum? 3) To what extent is subtropical humidity influenced by instrusions of stratospheric air? 4) What processes moisten the subtropical RH minimum to specific humidities above those encountered in the tropical upper troposphere? Ozone measurements are used to address question 3, as high ozone levels can identify intrusions of stratospheric air. The measurements will be complemented by a suite of diagonstic activities to identify water vapor transport pathways that account for the observed isotope ratios, specific humidity, and ozone concentration.\r\n\r\nThe work has broader impacts due to the importance of water vapor in the atmosphere, both through its role in the hydrological cycle and through its radiative effect as a greenhouse gas. The measurements and their analysis will provide increased understanding of the pathways through which water vapor circulates in the atmosphere, and the processes which determine atmospheric relative humidity in dry regions, which may ultimately improve our ability to forecast weather and anticipate climate change.  In addition, the project will educate and train a graduate student at a university with a substantial Hispanic and Native American student population.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the last decade, the measurement and analysis of the stable isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor has emerged as one of the most exciting new techniques for studying the atmospheric branch of Earth's water cycle.  Beginning in 2012, we deployed a new water vapor spectrometer at the high, isolated Chajnantor Plateau in northern Chile with the aim of making nearly continues measurements that could be used to constrain key climate uncertainties that revolve around water vapor.  By analyzing several years of data and developing new techniques for analyzing water vapor isotopic composition, we have advanced our knowledge of water vapor transport regionally and provided new constraints that be used to compare with climate models.\n\nIn the first suite of studies to emerge from this project, we used the isotopic measurements to identify and constrain some specific processes that have heretofore been poorly understood, including stratospheric air intrusions, cold air outbreaks, and the influence of the South American Monsoon on regional water vapor transport. \n\nIn the second suite of studies, we used what we leared from the first part of the project to develop an innovative new inverse modeling technique that uses observations to constrain model parameters.  This new inverse modeling technique has tremendous potential to transform the analysis of water vapor isotopic measurements and to provide an independent link between observational and modeling studies.  The inverse modeling technique was applied to the full dataset to quantify how the strength of the inversion offshore modulates water vapor transport from the marine boundary layer into the free troposphere, a parameter that is hard to estimate from other observations.\n\nThe project demonstrated the feasibility of operating water vapor isotopic analyzers for long periods and under extreme conditions.  We also developed a working relationship with the astronomical observatories at the Chajnantor Plateay, with potential for future climate studies at the site.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/10/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph Galewsky"
