The host scientist is Ji-Lin Zhou.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to create and implement a new data reduction technique involving the subtraction of two images. This method can be used to find planets in other solar systems, stars with varying light and supernovae. This research project uses data collected from telescopes in Antarctica.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
