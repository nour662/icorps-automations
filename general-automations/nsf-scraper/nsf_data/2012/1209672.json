The host scientist is Chih-Wei Chu.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to improve the processing conditions of organic photovoltaics through the use of layer-by-layer stamping techniques that are compatible with high-throughput manufacturing processes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
