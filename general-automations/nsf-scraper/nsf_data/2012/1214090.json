Through both in situ real-time and ex situ observations, the investigator will articulate the transformation of hematite and cerium oxide nanophases due to the presence of ferric ions. The nanoparticle-nanoparticle and nanoparticle-mineral surface relationships will be investigated with and without natural organic matter coatings. The project's reaction system will be both novel and advantageous in elucidating crucial information about the physical and chemical evolution of environmental and engineered NPs and biofilm in natural and engineered aquatic systems, such as wastewater treatment plants. In addition, transport studies and effluent analysis will allow connecting the degree of transverse mixing of the nanoparticles-humic acid-contaminant system in simulated groundwater and wastewater with the rate of system aggregation.\r\n \r\nIn this project, Professor Jun will develop an educational kit for teaching water quality concepts with support from Washington University's Science Outreach Office and collaboration with teachers from local K-12 schools in Missouri. Through collaboration with the Students and Teachers as Research Scientists program (STARS), the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program at Washington University, and the Undergraduate Research Office at Washington University, the investigator will recruit high school and undergraduate students for early involvement in scientific research projects, cultivating their creativity and curiosity via a project-based approach.",

This project investigated important nucleation processes at complex environmental interfaces. Though both <em>in situ</em> real-time and <em>ex situ</em> observations, Professor Jun&rsquo;s team studied the transformation of hematite and cerium oxide nanophases in the presence of ferrous or ferric ions. The team also elucidated the mechanisms and kinetics of the nucleation, growth, and aggregation of newly formed iron oxide nanoparticles on nanophase metal oxides in the presence of environmentally relevant ions. The findings concerning nanophase nucleation were examined in light of Classical Nucleation Theory to determine its applicability. The nanoparticle-nanoparticle and nanoparticle-mineral surface relationships were also investigated with and without organic coatings. Then, the team further investigated changes in cerium oxide NPs&rsquo; physicochemical properties and their colloidal stability during a wastewater treatment process (UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> advanced oxidation process). The utilization of engineered CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs has progressively increased in many industrial and medical applications. Consequently, these NPs will likely be introduced into natural environmental systems, especially aquatic systems, posing a higher risk of environmental pollution and danger to human health. Therefore, advanced knowledge about the effects of environmental factors on the fate and transport of natural, engineered, and hybrid NPs will help us predict their environmental impacts.</p>\n<p>From this project, Professor Jun&rsquo;s team has published 10 manuscripts and will submit three additional papers. The team disseminated their research outcomes through 18 invited presentations and 26 contributed presentations at national and international conferences, universities, laboratories, and industries.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The education and outreach plan of this project provided educational, research, international collaboration, and professional development opportunities for middle school, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. Simultaneously, it encouraged the participation and educational stimulation of students from traditionally underrepresented groups.

The team also continued to participate in the outreach workshop, &ldquo;Moving and Shaking: An Introduction to Environmental Science and Engineering&rdquo; for students in K 6-8.
