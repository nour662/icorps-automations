 "awd_abstract_narration": "On September 15-16, 2012, Wake Forest University (Winston-Salem, NC) is planning to hold the first of three Southeastern Number Theory Meetings being supported by funding for this proposal.  This will be organized by Jeremy Rouse and John Webb. A second conference is planned for December 1-2 at the University of South Carolina (Columbia, SC), and a third conference is planned for the Spring of 2013 at High Point University (High Point, NC). Further information for these meetings will be linked to the conference pages http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html  and  http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON/  as the organization of these meetings progresses.  An important goal of these meetings is to provide the community in the southeast region with knowledge of the current trends and developments in research topics in number theory.  Prominent researchers in number theory from outside the region are brought to the southeast to help achieve this goal.  The primary research topics for these meetings include analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms.  The frequency and regularity of the meetings promotes collaboration and strengthens working relationships between participants.\r\n\r\nThere are two main conferences held annually in the southeast that bring together those working on research in number theory.   The Palmetto Number Theory Series is a series of number theory meetings managed jointly by Clemson University and the University of South Carolina, the two flagship public research institutions in South Carolina, the Palmetto State.  The SouthEast Regional Meeting On Numbers is a larger regional meeting that has been in effect since the late 1980's.  These meetings inspire collaboration and  broaden the scope of existing research interests within the general subject of number theory.  One objective of these meetings is to involve number theorists at all career stages and types of institutions at minimal cost.  Speakers include graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty.  The meetings have, in particular, provided an important service to students and young researchers in this region working in number theory, strengthening their knowledge of this research area and allowing them to disseminate their work while at the same time obtaining insightful input from other participants.  These participants come from Ph.D. granting institutions, institutions whose highest degree awarded is a master's degree, and from institutions granting only baccalaureate degrees. The organizers will also continue to attract a demographically diverse participant base, including women and other underrepresented groups.",
