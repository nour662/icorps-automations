 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solid reinforced concrete structural walls that span from the foundation to the building roof are one of the most common structural systems used to resist earthquake forces in the United States and worldwide.  In many buildings, these walls surround stairs and elevators or are located at the building perimeter.  Evolution in wall design and construction practices has resulted in thinner, more efficient wall geometries that are pushing the seismic performance limits of this structural system. Indeed, poor performance in some recent earthquakes and structural engineering laboratory tests demonstrate that revisions in seismic design practices now are necessary to ensure that future construction meets the high performance expectations for modern construction.  This research will explore seismic design and performance limits for structural walls, considering both conventional and innovative wall construction practices.  The research will investigate: (a) mechanics models to understand poor performance of conventional construction, (b) innovative yet practical new systems that can transform design practices, (c) performance-based design limits for conventional and innovative systems, and (d) international collaborative development and interpretation of shake table tests of full-scale, three-dimensional building structures. This research is a collaborative effort among researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles and University of California at Berkeley. Primary tests will be conducted at the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) facilities at the University of California at Berkeley and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  In addition, the project team will collaborate with researchers from the University of Tokyo and Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention, who will conduct full-scale building tests on the E-Defense shake table facility in Miki, Japan. Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES Project Warehouse/data repository (http://www.nees.org).   \r\n\r\nThe research program tackles an important and challenging problem that will advance discovery and understanding of one of the most common building systems used to resist earthquake forces. The results of the research will be disseminated in multiple ways: by sharing results using NEES resources, by involving earthquake professionals, and by disseminating educational materials. The results will benefit society most directly by helping define appropriate seismic design requirements for efficient and high-performance building construction. These goals will be accomplished by the active participation of the researchers with professional organizations and by utilizing an advisory board of expert engineering professionals actively involved in earthquake engineering. Graduate and undergraduate student experiences will be enhanced by active participation in research and by collaboration among the participating universities, with Japanese researchers, and interactions with design professionals. This award is part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).",

Structural walls are solid concrete walls that typically encase stairwells at the ends of buildings or elevator banks near the central core (backbone) of a building.

Given these issues, the completed project focused on conducting large scale testing to better understand the reasons for the poor behavior. Testing was conducted incrementally, such that results from early tests could be incorporated into subsequent testing to achieve the greatest impact. Results from tests conducted at UC Berkeley and UC Los Angeles provided critical and unique data to develop and test a hypothesis that the displacement capacity of structural walls was impacted by wall cross section slenderness and wall loading demand parameters (neutral axis depth under combined bending and axial stress, and wall shear stress). Results from these tests were combined with information from another 23 tests reported in the literature, to create a small database that was used to develop a lateral drift capacity prediction equation in a displacement-based design format. The findings indicated that our current building codes do not adequately consider parameters that substantially impact the expected performance in moderate-to-large earthquake shaking and that, depending on these parameters, modern buildings designed using current code provisions are susceptible to damage and potential collapse. Subsequently, a comprehensive database was created with results from more than 160 ACI 318 compliant wall tests reported in the literature to develop a robust expression to predict wall lateral displacement capacities. Based on estimates of lateral drift capacities (from the database) and drift demands (from code-based computer models), a simple design check was proposed for the ACI 318-19 Building Code to require that drift demand be compared with drift capacity to verify that the expected performance with known reliability. The new test data provides critical information <span>&nbsp;</span>to understand parameters that impact wall drift capacity, and the new design approach provides a rational framework for design of buildings that utilize structural walls as a lateral-force-resisting systems.
