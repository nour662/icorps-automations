 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Raymond Schaak at the Pennsylvania State University is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in work to develop a total synthesis framework for the rational construction of complex colloidal hybrid nanoparticles for use in multi-catalytic reaction processes.  This research builds on recently established nanoparticle analogues of orthogonal reactivity, site-specific reactivity, chemoselectivity, regiospecificity, substituent effects, and coupling chemistry.  The reaction toolkit will be expanded to include new classes of nanoparticle transformations, linear vs. radial growth modes, and protection-deprotection strategies for overcoming the hybrid nanoparticles? natural tendencies toward nucleation and reactivity.  Ultimately, these synthetic tools and an understanding of how they occur will expand our knowledge of how to construct exceptionally complex hybrid nanoparticles and how to place nanoparticles at any desired location on a multi-domain particle.  These complex colloidal hybrid nanoparticles will be explored for use as multi-catalyst systems that couple several sequential catalytic transformations in a single-pot reaction.\r\n\r\nChemists approach the synthesis of large molecules by rationally modifying and linking together smaller molecular building blocks in a stepwise manner.  This process, which contrasts sharply with existing design capabilities for inorganic nanostructures, is guided by mechanistic considerations and empirical guidelines and is facilitated by an extensive library of chemical transformations.  Colloidal hybrid nanoparticles, which contain multiple distinct nanoparticle domains fused together through solid-state interfaces, can be considered as \"artificial molecules.\"  A primary goal of this research is to develop new synthetic tools, along with mechanistic insights into how they work, that will help to bridge the gap between the synthetic capabilities that exist for complex molecules vs. those available for hybrid nanoparticle systems, which are much less advanced.  These colloidal hybrid nanoparticles have the potential to function as modular systems for efficiently carrying out multiple catalytic reactions in a single pot.  A diverse group of students, including a team of undergraduate researchers, will be exposed to a unique cross-disciplinary project and will actively participate in a variety of outreach efforts.  A new inquiry-based undergraduate laboratory module to apply organic synthesis concepts to hybrid nanoparticle systems will be developed, and assignments introducing students to scientific ethics and the interface of chemistry and society will be developed and integrated into freshman chemistry courses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHybrid nanoparticles couple together multiple distinct nanoscale materials into a single system.  Such nanostructured materials contain multiple properties, which often can work together to enable new functions that arise because of the interactions among the components.  Hybrid nanoparticle systems underpin emerging applications in solar energy conversion, catalysis, optics, and biomedicine.  However, these applications place strict requirements on the characteristics of the hybrid nanoparticles that enable them.  It is therefore important to understand how these nanostructures form and how scientists can control the aspects of the materials that have greatest impact on their functions.  We have been developing pathways for the synthesis of hybrid nanoparticles that are inspired by the tools chemists use to synthesize complex organic molecules.  So-called \"total synthesis\" approaches allow chemists to break down a complex molecular product into a series of much simpler components that can be pieced together, one step at a time, in order to construct the target molecule.  Similarly, we have been developing synthetic tools that allow us to approach the synthesis of multi-component hybrid nanoparticles using multiple steps and sequential reactions of simpler nanoparticle building blocks.  In this project specifically, we have gained new understanding of how to controllably generate complex hybrid nanoparticle targets.  We have also developed new synthetic pathways to hybrid nanoparticles, introduced new nanoparticle materials, and helped to define the emerging field that involves the \"total synthesis of inorganic nanostructures.\" \n\nThree primary scientific outcomes of this project are particularly noteworthy.  First, we demonstrated that chemical reactions can selectively transform one component of a multi-component hybrid nanoparticle into a derivative material, thereby providing a pathway for rapidly expanding the palette of materials that can be incorporated into hybrid nanoparticle systems.  Specifically, we showed that the platinum domain of hybrid nanoparticles containing platinum (a catalyst) and iron oxide (a magnet) can be transformed into platinum lead and platinum tin alloys, which are structurally and functionally distinct from elemental platinum.  Second, we demonstrated that known chemical reactions used to produce semiconductor nanowires can be applied to hybrid nanoparticle systems in order to grow metal-semiconductor constructs with size-tunable semiconductor domains.  Specifically, we showed that gold and silver nanoparticle seeds could be supersaturated with germanium in solution and that elemental germanium grew outward from the metal seeds as a function of the reaction conditions, thereby generating a family of gold-germanium and silver-germanium hybrid nanoparticles with direct metal-semiconductor junctions and tunable domain sizes.  Third, we demonstrated that the location at which a third nanoparticle grows off of a two-component hybrid nanoparticle platform can be controlled in order to access multiple distinct ternary isomers in the same materials system.  Specifically, we showed that silver nanoparticles, which typically would grow off of the platinum domain of platinum-iron oxide hybrid nanoparticles, instead grow off of the iron oxide domain when the platinum surface is covered by a thin shell of a metal oxide.  This is a nanoparticle analogue of molecular protecting group chemistry, whereby a molecular fragment can be installed on a particular functional group in a larger molecule in order to block access to that functional group during subsequent reactions.  The result is a pathway to two distinct ternary hybrid nanoparticle isomers, each with distinct configurations and functions:  silver &ndash; platinum &ndash; iron oxide vs. platinum &ndash; iron oxide &ndash; silver.  These tools are providing the foundation for continuing research that seeks to design and synthesize more complex hybrid nanop..."
