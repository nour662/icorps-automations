 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program (SYN) of NSF's Division of Chemistry, Professor David A. Shultz of the North Carolina State University and his students are investigating donor-acceptor interactions that are ubiquitous in both nature and in molecular electronics.  Research in this area includes a wealth of effort aimed at developing an understanding of how molecular bridge (B) fragments facilitate electron transfer between donors (D) and acceptors (A), especially over long distances.  This project will show how the electron spin exchange coupling in semiquinone-nitronylnitroxide (SQ-B-NN) D-B-A biradical ligands can be used to reveal key structure-property relationships concerning the electronic coupling matrix element, H_DA.  Elucidating these fundamental structure-property relationships can lead to significant advances in our understanding of electron transfer/transport in molecule-based devices as well as suggest novel molecular architectures for such devices.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research aims to prepare and characterize molecules designed to clarify and to advance our understanding of how electrons are transferred from one part of a molecule to another.  Electron transfer is ubiquitous in both nature (e.g., photosynthesis) and in the marketplace (electronic devices).  The results will advance our understanding of intramolecular interactions that control electron transfer and may revolutionize the design of molecules for electronics.  This research area provides excellent training for students in the areas of molecular design, synthesis, spectroscopy and theory.  In addition, the PI will support students from a local HBCU for summer research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project entitled, \"Metal Complexes of Donor-Bridge-Acceptor Biradical Ligands: From Nanoscopic Electron Correlation to Inhibition of Back Electron Transfer,\" sought to understand how electrons within molecules communicate in order to (1) rationally design future electronic devices based on molecules and (2) to understand electron transfer and transport in general.\n\nHarnessing solar energy for use here on earth requires new materials that absorb sunlight and convert it into energy or store it as fuel.  Achieving this requires an in-depth understanding of how these new materials \"communicate\" to achieve the detailed steps at converting light into energy or fuel.  Our research seeks to demonstrate fundamental relationships between portions of molecules called \"electron donors\" and \"electron acceptors.\"  Understanding the interactions between these donors and acceptors is at the heart of solar energy conversion.  Our research has shown how this communication changes as a function of the molecule's length and as a function of the molecule's shape -- both of which can be controlled by chemists.  We have also prepared a new class of compounds in which electronic communication is achieved over a long distance (on the molecular scale!).\n\nLikewise, interaction of donors and acceptors is fundamental to designing new electronic devices that operate at the single-molecule level, and not only make use of an electron's charge, but its \"spin.\"  Electron spin is the property that gives rise to magnetism, and harnessing magnetic properties of electrons could result in new electronic devices that are faster and consume less energy.  Our research has resulted in several new molecules whose magnetic properties change upon illumination with white light.\n\nOur research has led to a new way of understanding critical design features of molecule-based current rectifiers (diodes).  These findings fill a void between actual devices and high-level calculations, and will be useful to chemists who design molecules for molecular electronics.\n\nFinally, our results offer great hope for creating novel building blocks for \"quantum\" computers.  Quantum computers store information and execute computations by making use of discreet energy levels characteristic of atoms or molecules. and Such computers are on the horizon and will carry out calculations of unprecedented complexity at unprecedented speeds.  The quantum analog of a \"bit\" is called a \"qubit,\" our new building blocks use light to create three qubits instantaneously, as well as provide a new mechanism to \"read\" the qubits. \n\nAll of our discoveries are at the fundamental level, but could play an important role in theories of electron transfer, and in new single-molecule devices and quantum computers.  As such, our research is of interest to chemists, physicists, materials scientists and engineers.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that this research has provided the training ground for several excellent students who are now employed in Academia (Georgia-Gwinnett and Shaw) as well as companies such as Advanced Liquid Logic, BASF, Cree, Inc. and Combi-Blocks.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Shultz"
