 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to develop variable-geometry dies for extruding complex plastic parts. Unlike most existing polymer extrusion dies, which have a single fixed geometry, design techniques will be created to build novel moving dies that morph between different shapes. Coordination of multiple actuators during the extrusion process will impose these changes in shape. The actuator locations will be optimized to provide the mechanical advantage required to resist the sizable pressure loads inside the extruder. The optimization will be accomplished with a genetic algorithm that considers the many design constraints, which include avoiding interference of moving parts, eliminating obstructions to the flow of the molten plastic, achieving a reasonably sized die, and minimizing actuator power consumption. Experimental work will develop new ways to manage the leakage of molten plastic within the die due to its moving parts. Prototype variable-geometry dies will be built and tested on a production extruder operated by an industrial collaborator. Validation experiments will derive empirical relationships between changes in the die geometry, extruder screw speed, and plastic temperature to provide process control settings that yield defect-free parts.\r\n\r\nThis research seeks to create the next generation of polymer extrusion dies that can produce a wider variety of more complex plastic parts. Specifically, the work aims to enable polymer extrusion to replace injection molding for a class of plastic parts, thereby simultaneously reducing production costs and manufacturing time. Additionally, it aspires to offer designers the flexibility to create novel engineering solutions with entirely new plastic parts of varying cross sectional shape. The developed design tools will have broader application to creating other variable-geometry structures such as morphing aircraft wings and micro-scale extrusion dies.",

Current technology, however, is limited to making parts with a constant cross sectional shape using a fixed geometry die. This project developed the methods to design dies whose shape can be changed during the extrusion process to enable the inexpensive manufacture of more complex plastic parts. Some of these methods use a single actuator to drive the shape change of the die. For complex changes in shape, the methods are altered to enlarge the design space by allowing for multiple actuators to be used. This multi-actuator approach typically provides a wider variety of candidate die designs from which to choose, designs that better match the desired shapes, and/or designs that require smaller actuators to move. With the design space for these dies being larger, new techniques were needed to search in that space to find the best designs. This project developed a way to enumerate every possible way the die can be put together so that the best configurations could be found efficiently. With at least one actuator used to move the die in all cases, how to control the actuator(s) is another key challenge. Therefore, this project also applied an existing control approach in a new way to ultimately manufacture parts having the desired geometry. Iterative learning control (ILC) provides an algorithm by which the system &ldquo;learns&rdquo; from errors in each trial and converges on how to move the actuators such that these errors are reduced/eliminated in later trials. This project was the first to apply ILC to control the final geometry of an extruded plastic part. ILC is useful in this context because it effectively handles delays in measuring errors before adjusting the actuator. This is important because in extrusion, the part has to cool to its final shape before it can be measured, and that introduces these time delays. Experiments with a shape-changing die conducted on a production extruder at an industrial partner&rsquo;s facility showed that ILC can help produce variable geometry parts of quality equivalent to that of existing fixed-geometry parts.
