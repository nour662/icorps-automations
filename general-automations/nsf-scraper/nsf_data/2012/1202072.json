Riviere and Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of partial differential equations. The 2012 program will feature two principle speakers (Panagiotis Souganidis and Antonio Cordoba), each of whom will give a two-hour lecture, and a number of one-hour talks delivered primarily by young  mathematicians (Thomas Alazard, Giuseppe Mingione, Gabriella Tarantello, Rachel Ward). The program allows ample time for informal discussion among the participants.",
