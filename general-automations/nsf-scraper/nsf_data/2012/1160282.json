The main conference, PLDI, is being held in Beijing, China. PLDI is a top conference in the field of programming language and compiler technology.  Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include building the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce.",
