The accelerated\u00a0creation of\u00a0city-scale developments and regional megalopolises brings urgency to\u00a0understanding their impact on the local and regional\u00a0environment and inhabitants.\u00a0New\u00a0computational and information capabilities, along with unprecedented and\u00a0growing volumes of relevant data, suggest new opportunities to understand the\u00a0state of urban social and economic systems and to develop\u00a0calibrated, validated\u00a0computational models to explore the potential impact of new policies,\u00a0investments, and accelerating expansion of urban\u00a0built infrastructure.\r\n\r\nResearchers recognize the potential for new insights and\u00a0more effective policy and planning if research teams had the ability to explore\u00a0these\u00a0data as an integrated corpus, yet the equilibrium state is one of\u00a0daunting fragmentation and access restrictions that can only be overcome by\u00a0a\u00a0critical mass of researchers and a compelling, broad research agenda that\u00a0resonates with the near- and long-term challenges of\u00a0policymakers and citizens.\u00a0Moreover, new data organization and analysis approaches will require\u00a0partnerships between social, behavioral,\u00a0education, and economics scientists\u00a0and computational scientists.\r\n\r\nThe project will create a research coordination network that\u00a0brings these communities together to develop an integrated research agenda for\u00a0an interdisciplinary, data-driven approach to urban research, analysis, and\u00a0planning, exploring and prototyping methods, processes, tools,\u00a0and\u00a0infrastructure necessary to support such science. The RCN will leverage a\u00a0unique and growing collection of data sets and research teams\u00a0spanning\u00a0The University of Chicago,\u00a0the\u00a0School of the Art Institute of Chicago,\u00a0the\u00a0City of Chicago, and\u00a0Skidmore, Owings and Merrill,\u00a0a\u00a0global architecture firm designing\u00a0city-scale urban infrastructure.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Urban Sciences RCN (US-RCN) plan comprised three phases unfolding over three years:\n\n1) Building community research vision around unique urban-related data sources, \n\n2) Expanding participation in urban data-driven science and access to urban data, while developing data analysis methodologies, and \n\n3) Prototyping methodologies and developing sustainable process and infrastructure requirements to support the study of cities and urban processes using emerging and rapidly growing (in sources and volume) urban-related data.\n\nUS-RCN has grown to include over 120 scientists and policy makers from around the world, as illustrated by the 2016 Chicago Convening, which was in collaboration with UChicago Urban Labs, the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, and the OECD Experts Group that created the report \"Research Ethics and New Forms of Data for Social and Economic Research,\" published by OECD in November 2016.  To illustrate the diversity of US-RCN participants, the 2016 convening included scientific presentations by researchers from UChicago, NYU, University of Liverpool, Arizona State University, Santa Fe Institute, Ohio State University, University of California-Berkeley, University of Aberdeen, University of Virginia, University of Warwick, University of Washington, MIT, University of Illinois-Chicago, Boston University, Argonne National Laboratory, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Northeastern University, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, National Opinion Research Center, Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago, Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Harvard University.  Cities and industry speakers also presented, with speakers from Gallup, Atlanta Regional Commission, City of Chicago, and the City of Boston.\n\nThis growing community has already catalyzed new interdisciplinary collaborations.  For example, computational scientists studying the transmission of diseases in populations found collaborators at US-RCN events resulting in the use of their tools to support medical and social sciences who were independently studying the spread of information in populations (related to health and social services, respectively).  Similarly, computational scientists using transportation routing tools met social scientists at US-RCN events, resulting in application of these tools toward understanding neighborhoods and resource proximity.  Previously these scientists looked at physical proximity (e.g. \"as the crow flies\") but such transportation tools enabled consideration of proximity in more human terms&mdash;how long does it take to move from point A to point B.\n\nTo illustrate the type of collaborative projects that US-RCN has catalyzed, US-RCN networking brought together the Lindau Lab at the University of Chicago with designers from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) to create the \"FeedFirst\" project. FeedFirst is examining how free food pantries in Comer Childrens? Hospital can sustainably alleviate unnecessary suffering due to hunger among caregivers with a hospitalized child.\n\nThe US-RCN also supported collaborative work between SAIC and the MIT Center for Civic Media on the \"Safety in Numbers\" project.
