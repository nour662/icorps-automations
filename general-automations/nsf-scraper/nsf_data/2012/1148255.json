 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will catalyze a new generation of sensor-based streaming data applications by building on the foundation of the Open Source DataTurbine (OSDT) middleware (www.dataturbine.org). This will involve strategic software development, systems integration and testing, science experiments, and education and outreach. The software developments will include (A) tools for configuring, testing, and controlling distributed sensor systems, (B) software interfaces that are compliant with the Open Geospatial Consortium Sensor Web Enablement standards, (C) a new OSDT-Matlab interface, and (D) OSDT cybersecurity enhancements. These software products will be integrated into the production research infrastructures at Purdue, the University of Connecticut, the North Temperate Lake LTER Network site, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. The software will be professionally developed and managed as community resources. The intellectual merit of this project will be advances in software engineering, interoperability standards, and systems management for complex real-time sensor systems as well as advances on important open questions in civil engineering, marine science, and ecology. This project will yield broader impacts by enabling new science applications, enhancing productivity, and accelerating innovation across NSF directorates. To ensure that these broader impacts are realized, the team will provide student research opportunities, develop curriculum materials and training courses, and cultivate a community of software users.",

Moreover, the technologies developed within this project are enabling more advanced testing than has been done in the past, especially with regard to the distributed use of key laboratories to improve testing efficiency and reduce testing costs. See more details below. \n\n\nEducation and Outreach: Educational efforts also exploited the use of Data Turbine middleware to execute tele-operation experiments using seismic simulator tables. Undergraduate civil engineering students in Cali, Colombia, South America used the remote shake table at Purdue University to learn about structural dynamics and earthquake responses (see photos of experiments Figure..."
