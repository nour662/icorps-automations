The termination of translation, a crucial step in protein synthesis, must occur with high fidelity, to prevent premature release from the ribosome of incompletely synthesized proteins.  Release factors 1 and 2 (RF1 and RF2) recognize the stop codons in the mRNA and trigger hydrolysis of the bond linking the newly completed protein to the tRNA in the P site.  The long-term objective of this research is to study the mechanism of translation termination to determine how high fidelity is achieved.  Examination of crystal structures of RF1 and RF2 bound to the ribosome has revealed amino acids in the RFs that are crucial for stop codon recognition.  The first aim of the project is to probe how these key residues dynamically discriminate between sense and stop codons.  In the second aim, the project will examine the roles of conformational changes that RF1 and RF2 undergo when they bind to the ribosome.  These conformational changes may serve as functional switches to activate hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA linkages after stop codons are recognized.  Currently there is no information available about the conformational changes that occur in RF1 and RF2 as they bind to the ribosome.  In the third aim, the mechanism by which release factor 3 (RF3) catalyzes the dissociation of RF1 and RF2 from the ribosome will be elucidated.  This research will investigate these outstanding questions in translation termination using fluorescence-based, pre-steady state kinetic analysis, site-directed mutagenesis of critical residues, and biochemical assays.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis project serves an important educational need by integrating research and teaching.  Several undergraduate minority students and graduate students will obtain state-of-the-art research training in advanced biophysical methods.  The PI actively participates in outreach activities such as the STARS program and the UCSD Next Step program.  In addition, the PI has mentored students from the local high schools to carry out science projects in the laboratory.  A high school student from Canyon Crest Academy will join the PI's laboratory this summer.  The undergraduates and high school student will carry out site-directed mutagenesis of RF1 and RF2 and will also assist in the purification and characterization of mutant proteins, to contribute to the work while gaining important scientific skills.  Several undergraduates have contributed significantly in the past and co-authored research publications.  The results of this study will also be published in scientific journals and disseminated broadly to enhance scientific understanding of protein synthesis, a central step in gene expression.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n1.  Intellectual merit\n\nProtein synthesis is a fundamental process in all cells.  Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis.  During protein synthesis, ribosomes translate the mRNA sequence to synthesize the corresponding protein.  The entry of a stop codon into the ribosomal A site triggers the termination phase of protein synthesis.  The stop codon in the ribosomal A site is recognized by release factors 1 and 2 (RF1 and RF2), which catalyze the release of the newly synthesized protein from the ribosome.  The goal of this project was to understand better how RF1 and RF2 can recognize the stop codons with high fidelity.  First, our studies showed that RF1 can recognize a stop codon and promote peptide release even when specific interactions between conserved residues in RF1 and the stop codon is disrupted.  This result suggests that RF1 uses redundant mechanisms to discriminate stop codons from sense codons.  Second, we used a newly developed method, called transition metal ion FRET (tmFRET) to monitor conformational changes in RF1.  Our studies showed that RF1 changes its conformation from a closed to an open state when it binds to ribosomes with a stop codon in the A site.  It is possible that RF1 uses an induced fit mechanism to discriminate stop codons from sense codons.  Finally, we analyzed the mechanism of RF3 catalyzed dissociation of RF1 from the ribosome.  We developed several fluorescence-based methods to monitor directly the dissociation of RF1 and RF3 from the ribosome.  Our results show that the GTP bound form of RF3 promotes the dissociation of RF1 from the ribosome.  Thus, our studies provide important insights into the mechanism of stop codon recognition by RF1 and RF2 and the function of RF3.\n\n2.  Broader impacts\n\nThe broader impact of this project is that it advances knowledge about a fundamental process that occurs in all cells.  Specifically, understanding the mechanism of translation termination is essential for the development of new antibiotics to treat life-threatening bacterial infections.  During this project, we have developed several new fluorescence-based methods to monitor specific steps in translation termination.  These methods could be broadly applicable to other fields.  Finally, several undergraduate minority students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scientists have obtained invaluable training in advanced biophysical methods.  Also, several high school students performed their iGEM projects in my laboratory.  Thus, the project not only advanced new knowledge but also served an important educational need.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Simpson Joseph"
