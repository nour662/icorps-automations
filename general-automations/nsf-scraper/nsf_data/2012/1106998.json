 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project concerns theoretical study of mathematical models of large random\r\nnetworks, with a focus on the following two settings.  Certain observed features\r\nof the U.S. road network are consistent with it being approximately\r\nscale-invariant over scales of 5 - 500 miles.  It is proposed to study\r\nmathematical properties of models that are exactly scale-invariant.  Such study\r\nraises new foundational and substantive issues.  Second, there is great current\r\ninterest in information flow in social networks.   Relevant abstract mathematical\r\nmodels are similar to models previously studied in many different scientific and\r\nengineering contexts (epidemics; broadcasting in computer networks;  interacting\r\nparticles in statistical physics).  It is proposed to delineate a particular\r\nbroad class (``Finite Markov Information Exchange\") of such models, record what\r\nis already known about them, and formulate and investigate many new questions.\r\nThe formulation of questions is guided by analogy with the well understood theory\r\nsurrounding mixing times for finite Markov chains.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the research level, broader impacts envisaged from this research are\r\nfacilitating the spread of techniques between different research communities\r\nand providing additional tools for the design, analysis and empirical\r\ninvestigation of large networks.  At the postgraduate training level the\r\nsecond topic provides a fertile field of open problems and varying apparent\r\ndifficulty, whose study will expose the student to a broad range of techniques.\r\nBoth topics also fit well with the principal investigator's activities in\r\nundergraduate teaching (a \"probability and the real world\" course) and\r\nsupervising undergraduate research projects.",
