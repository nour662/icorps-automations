 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prosody is a critical component of spoken communication. Loosely defined, prosody is ?how words are spoken?, as opposed to ?what words are said?. Prosody is typically defined to include pitch, intensity, and timing -- and systematic variation in these parameters can reinforce or augment a speaker?s intended meaning. Prosody provides important information at every linguistic level, disambiguating syntax, augmenting semantics and pragmatic information, e.g. by conveying information about phrasal grouping and phrase-level prominence. Emotions and other speaker-state information are also communicated through a speaker?s prosody. \r\n\r\nAlthough this aspect of speech is important, it remains under-investigated. A major limiting factor is the lack of large sample of prosodically labeled speech. Prosody researchers at CUNY, Columbia and MIT are developing Reciprosody, a web source of prosodically annotated data and tools for analysis. Reciprosody makes critical resources for the study and teaching of prosody available to a growing and diverse population of researchers, students, and technologists. This website hosts data in any language, annotated under any prosody standard. The only restriction for hosting data in the repository is that it must be made freely available for academic and educational activities. \r\n\r\nReciprosody is not merely a passive repository, but an active resource for researchers and educators to communicate with each other on a regular basis. This enables the resource to be a center not only for annotated data, but information and support related to ongoing prosody research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPopularly described as \"tone of voice\", prosody describes those qualities of speech that are not related to the words that are being spoken. This includes pitch, loudness, voice quality, speaking rate and rhythm.  Prosody communicates a wide range of information in spoken communication.  There exist a number of theories about prosodic structure, however, large, high-quality corpora containing annotation of prosodic phenomena are few and far between.\n\nThe work supported under this CRI, Reciprosody - A Repository for Prosodically Annotated Material, had two major directions toward advancing research infrastructure: developing the community of prosody researchers and establishing a common repository for prosodically annotated speech.\n\nOne of our two main goals was to support and develop the community of prosody researchers.  This is an interdisciplinary group drawn from linguistics, speech and hearing, computer science and electrical engineering.  Our intention has been to bolster dialog around the common issues related to data availability, collection and annotation.  To facilitate this, we hosted a workshop \"Data Issues in Prosody Research\" at Columbia University in January 2013.  This 1.5 day workshop was attended by 21 researchers from the US and Europe.  Attendees presented current research and had robust discussions about what the major roadblocks to prosody research are, particularly as they relate to the availability and quality of data.  This workshop and subsequent communication among participants supports a focused and robust discussion among this community.\n\nThe second goal of this work was the establishment of an open, shared repository of prosodically annotated material.  In Reciprosody (http://reciprosody.org) this has been technologically successful.  We have developed a web application with a unique back-end and front-end to support the community of prosody researchers.  The backend supports version control for all corpora.  This allows researchers to modify and maintain all hosted material.  Version numbering allows for a consistent mechanism to refer to instances of corpora without fear that these results will become out of date should the corpus expand or be refined.  The front end allows a user to browse hosted corpora, link publications and tools to corpora.  Moreover, users can receive notifications on changes to corpora which they are interested in, and discuss any corpus, publication or tool via a comments.   Moreover, we have prototyped an audio annotation preview function within the browser.  This allows a user to listen to an audio file while looking at corresponding linguistic annotations without downloading a full corpus.  The next step in this development is the ability to modify annotations in the browser.    An initial version of Reciprosody launched in 2013.  In 2015, we relaunched Reciprosody after addressing security concerns.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel"
