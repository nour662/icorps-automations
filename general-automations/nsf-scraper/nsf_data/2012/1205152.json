 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent years have seen the loss of massive amounts of multi-year sea ice from the Arctic Ocean and its replacement by first year sea ice.  As first year ice freezes, a crystalline structure known as frost flowers forms on its surface.  Frost flowers are delicate structures, high in brine content, and susceptible to wind-driven dispersion unless rapidly buried by snow.  Funds are provided to contribute to a test of the hypothesis that frost flowers are a suitable habitat for microbes and viruses, advecting them upward with brine and concentrating them in the frost flowers as these form.  Previous research has included laboratory studies of frost flower formation and isolated field sampling of these structures.  This effort will allow the principal investigator access to a polynya for a period of time sufficient to sample and study the temporal evolution of frost flowers and their associated microbial communities.\r\n\r\nThis award will bring microbial expertise and a US presence to an international collaboration in Greenland.  Results of this project will be incorporated immediately into a college course on Arctic Change.  While in Greenland, the international team will engage in outreach to local communities.  The results of this research will shed light on potential mechanisms for the air-sea exchange and subsequent aeolian transport of microbes and viruses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main goal of this project was to investigate an extreme habitat for microbial life &ndash; the salty ice-crystal structures known as frost flowers that grow on the surface of newly freezing sea ice in the Arctic Ocean &ndash; during wintertime when research in the high Arctic is especially challenging.  These habitats are important to explore, given the increasing spatial extent of their occurrence in the Arctic during winter and their known roles in atmospheric chemistry.  The project took advantage of an invitation to participate in a unique international expedition, led by Soeren Rysgaard (head of the Greenland Climate Research Center in Nuuk, Greenland), to a marine fjord system in Northeast Greenland known as Young Sound during the coldest month of the year, March, in 2012. We met the original objectives of this project by sampling frost flowers over time as they grew on the surface of young sea ice &ndash; ice that formed in an opening we made in the thin ice cover that had just frozen over a polynya (area of open water where sea ice typically occurs) at the mouth of the Sound.  We learned that elevated densities of marine bacteria, already present in the liquid brines within the new and porous sea ice, were immediately wicked upwards into the frost flowers at the start of the growing period.  The bacteria then persisted over the duration of the 48-hour experiment, showing a decline in concentration over time only because ice crystals, originating from the moist atmosphere instead of the brine below, began to deposit on the frost flowers, diluting the number of marine bacteria present in the melted samples examined.  No evidence of bacterial mortality (for example, due to viral infection) was detected, though the bacteria appeared to be responding to the extreme conditions of the frost flowers (&ndash;12&deg;C and over three times the salinity of seawater) by producing organic compounds known for their ability to protect cells against the damaging effects of freezing and high salt concentration.  We also confirmed, via DNA sequencing, that frost flowers are a selective environment, harboring a marine bacterial community that overlaps with those in the surrounding sea ice and seawater yet has a distinctive community structure.  The main bacterial players were characteristic of a nutrient-poor environment, as expected for Young Sound in winter, but also included marine bacteria known for their ability to generate the nutrient nitrate, thus possibly contributing to the spring bloom of algae and phytoplankton in the region.  We further learned that an active marine bacterial community established itself in the new sea ice more rapidly than the ice-algal community, fueling speculation of a time-based synergy between bacterial and algal communities in the ice.  As an interdisciplinary team, we determined that the coverage of new sea ice by frost flowers did not prevent the penetration of sufficient sunlight to fuel an algal bloom in the underlying waters, nor did it impede the wintertime release of carbon dioxide from the ice into the atmosphere.  We are bringing these results to the attention of the scientific community through the peer-reviewed literature (three manuscripts, one published, one under review, one ready to submit) and through numerous conference presentations at local, national and international levels.  Several graduate students have received unique training experiences as a result of this award.  The principal investigator has given public lectures to large audiences outside of academia, including to indigenous peoples and through open-access websites with videos of the work done in Young Sound (http://vimeo.com/49830362), bringing the fascination of these newly discovered and extreme microbial habitats into the public realm.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jody W Deming"
