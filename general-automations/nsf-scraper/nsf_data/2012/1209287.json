 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Dissertation Improvement Grant award will provide funds to develop quantitative linkages between plant form, function and climate. Leaf venation is highly correlated with key climate variables, such as mean annual temperature, atmospheric CO2 and aridity. Climate is a key determinant of plant form and function, but a strong mechanistic linkage between these factors remains lacking. Identifying this mechanism will improve scaling-up of individual plant measurements to climate variation, and scaling-down of climate models to their impact on local ecosystems. A quantitative model will be developed and parameterized. The model will be tested on community weighted leaf venation measurements gathered along two elevational gradients, one in Costa Rica and one in Colorado. Preliminary results suggest strong correlations between vein density and growing season mean temperature along these gradients. The model and analyses will elucidate a mechanistic basis for predicting how variation in climate affects living systems. The analysis will be expanded by applying these quantitative methods to venation patterns in fossil leaves from well-described paleo-communities. Historically, leaf margins from fossil leaves have been used to link morphology to past climate. The research proposes to substantiate that leaf venation provides an accurate mechanism to reconstruct paleo-climate than leaf margins. An innovative approach to broader impacts is proposed by using crowd sourcing approaches to analyze leaf venation.  A web portal to enable citizen-science participation in data analysis, and will provide lesson plans for teachers to integrate climate and leaves into their classrooms. These lessons will be developed and tested through a  partnership with Miles Exploratory Learning Center (Tucson) and disseminated to hundreds of teachers through an existing relationship with the University of Arizona's College of Science K-12 outreach programs.",

Despite these visually obvious patterns, it has been difficult for scientists to predict why certain species can only live in certain places. A key approach has been to use functional traits, i.e. measurable properties of organismal performance such as photosynthetic rates, that ought to control how well species can perform across environments. However we have had limited success in finding strong relationships between these traits and the environment.\n\nThis work therefore addresses this problem by asking the following questions -\n\n1) do leaf venation networks provide a strong linkage between traits and climate?\n\n2) can leaf venation networks be measured in fossils to reconstruct climate change througout the earth`s past?\n\nVenation networks may provide a useful approach for these questions because they are highly functional, providing water and sugar transport in plant leaves as well as mechanical support. Thus certain kinds of vein patterns should be more or less functional in different environmental contexts, and thus potentially predict where and why certain species live in certain places. The wide variety of patterns seen in nature (easy to notice by holding leaves up to the sunlight) suggests that species may take a range of different strategies.\n\nSpecific objectives\n\nIn this project we developed a set of mathematical models based on plant ecophysiology to predict how vein networks are related to aspects of climate such as temperature and carbon dioxide concentration. We also tested these models on a wide set of tropical tree species spanning the Amazon to the Andes. Finally, we explored how vein patterns changed across several million years of intense ecological change spanning the Cretaceou - Paleogene boundary (in which a meteorite impact killed the dinosaurs).\n\nResults\n\nWe found that theory could predict observed patterns of vein-climate variation across the Amazon and Andes, confirming its basic validity and utility.
