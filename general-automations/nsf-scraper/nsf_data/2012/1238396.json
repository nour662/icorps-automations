 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning project is a step toward developing a subsequent multi-year comparative study between the United States and England regarding emerging and continuing patterns of minorities in graduate Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and related fields.  The potential comparative study that results from this planning process will seek to build upon pronouncements and policies of two leading G-8 nations, the United States of America and England, to produce STEM graduates in order to move forward with competitive global endeavors. \r\n \r\nIn late 2011, the National Center for Educational Statistics highlighted descriptive educational data among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Specifically, the United States was compared with several OECD countries where the indicators of achievement varied. While such information is useful, the statistics do not delve into the sociocultural, academic, and policy dynamics that help to comprehend the phenomena contributing to the distinctions.  The potential comparative study that results from this planning process will examine the underlying variables, focusing on STEM graduate and related programs, specifically in two leading G-8 countries where some racial and ethnic minorities have not been full participants, despite the absence of de jure impediments. The demographic groups that will be included in the comparative study include African Americans, Mexican/Hispanic Americans, African English, Caribbean English, and Pakistani English, who have been educationally disadvantaged and/or underrepresented in the United States and England in STEM.",
