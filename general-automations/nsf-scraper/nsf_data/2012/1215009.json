 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore whether electromyographic (EMG) signals from a vestigial neuromuscular system can serve as a virtual ?controller? for those with spinal cord injuries. Repurposing these unused muscles could open a new channel of innate and intuitive control over a computer cursor, nearby electronics, or a motorized wheelchair. This project will recruit several subjects for a pilot study evaluating the ability to control a computer interface via EMG signals recorded by surface electrodes placed over the muscles. This project will culminate in the development of a headset capable of capturing, processing and wirelessly transmitting the intended EMG signals to any target device.\r\n \r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be greatest in the assistive technology space. Limitations of mobility and interpersonal interaction are primary factors determining functional independence and quality of life in people with physical disabilities, yet existing assistive devices remain cumbersome and usurp the individual?s few remaining still-functioning motor systems. This innovation in assistive technology could bring a new computer interface device to those with even the most severe spinal cord injuries and many of the most severe brain lesions, and has the potential to change how anyone interfaces with their environment. Users would, in essence, develop a new mode of command output that can be wirelessly applied to any target device.",
