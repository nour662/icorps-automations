A.\t      ORG: Materials Research Society\r\n\r\nTitle:  Spring 2012 MRS Symposium PP: Manipulating Cellular Microenvironments\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT:  The cellular microenvironment plays a crucial role in normal development by guiding stem-cell fate and tissue organization, but it may also contribute to pathological processes such as tumor progression and metastasis.  The need for interdisciplinary approaches for deconstructing the cellular microenvironment is becoming more widely recognized, with materials scientists and engineers well positioned to advance our understanding of complex biological systems.  The symposium will provide an overview of current research aimed at determining how complex biological components work together to shape physiological outcomes and to develop strategies for manipulating these processes for clinical applications.  These examples will demonstrate how engineering principles are well suited for advancing our understanding of biology and the power of interdisciplinary research for tackling complex biological systems.  The goal of this symposium is to expand participation and promote new interactions by bringing together researchers with a common biological interest, namely, understanding cellular microenvironments.  By including a common biological theme, researchers will gain a broader perspective of the ways in which different types of chemical and mechanical cues influence cells and the techniques that enable that information to be collected.  Due to the variety of techniques that will be discussed within the symposium, there will be numerous opportunities to capture the interest to the broader materials science community, e.g., microfluidics, nanomaterials, polymers. \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  The symposium provides a highly interactive program that promotes the sharing of ideas and opportunities for development of new collaborations.  It brings to bear the perspectives of researchers from both the biological and engineering communities in order to improve communication between them and to develop and refine strategies for going forward.  The organizers have also given significant attention to pursuit of NSF priorities.  Women and other underrepresented groups are a predominant component of the invited speaker list in order to encourage diversity within the engineering community.  Altogether at least 13 of the 16 invited speakers are women and/or minorities.  NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of two junior faculty members, two postdoctoral students, four graduate students, and two undergraduate students.",
