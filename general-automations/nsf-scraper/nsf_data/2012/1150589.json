 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase-II project develops advanced\r\ntechnology capabilities for constructing and deploying client-adapted\r\nautomated language translation systems within commercial settings that are\r\nused by globalizing enterprises and the language service provider companies\r\n(LSPs) that provide translation services to such enterprise clients.  The\r\ndeveloped technology leverages databases of previously-translated material in\r\norder to produce client-adapted high-quality fully-automatic translations for\r\ncommercial language service providers (LSPs) and their enterprise clients.\r\nThis approach provides a scalable and less-costly solution for\r\ncreating and deploying client-specific customized Machine Translation (MT)\r\nengines.  Once deployed, these customized MT systems expand the capabilities\r\nof clients to translate volumes of content that are not feasible to translate\r\nusing current methods.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the impact\r\nthat it will have on the broad commercial translation industry.  The\r\ntechnology developed in the project is likely to significantly reduce barriers\r\nto wide-spread adoption of MT technology by the broad LSP industry and their\r\nenterprise client-base. The 2010 commercial translation market is a $26\r\nbillion industry, growing at a healthy pace. Current commercial MT offerings\r\nare expensive and too difficult to deploy for most enterprises and service\r\nproviders.  Free web-based translation services serve casual users, but do not\r\nmeet the quality and security needs of enterprises. The technology developed\r\nin this project and the cloud-based delivery model support scalable,\r\neasy-to-integrate MT services, which are highly attractive to a broad range of\r\npotential clients.  This approach will support cost-effective content generation into\r\nmultiple target languages at a massive scale, a capability that is essential\r\nfor globalizing US enterprises in order to compete in the information-rich\r\nmarket place of the 21st century.",
