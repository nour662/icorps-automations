 "awd_abstract_narration": "While higher use of electric vehicles (EV) is a goal of governments and organizations conscious of energy conservation and environmental sustainability, EVs still have to attract owners. This project hypothesizes that the proper placement and sizing of battery-exchange (BE) facilities will make EVs more appealing since the driver's anxiety that the vehicle will run out of charge before reaching the destination will be decreased. Optimal location of BE facilities decrease the detouring required for swapping batteries, while optimal sizing of facilities improves quality of service of the facilities. This project comprehensively addresses the \"Design, Analysis and Evaluation of Battery-Changing Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles\" from a systems perspective.\r\n\r\nGreater attraction and higher market penetration of EVs will lead to a cleaner environment and less dependence on oil and gasoline. The project will be useful to automobile companies that manufacture EVs, urban and transportation planners, energy grid operators, service companies that offer recharged batteries, and, last but not least, the Denmark Technical University where the project team's collaborates with researchers who are studying to fast-track EV penetration in Denmark. Also, besides the direct relevance to EV-based transportation, the several new models and methods developed intellectually contribute to the fields of operations research, computer science, industrial engineering, transportation, geographical analysis, and related fields. They also are applicable to alternative fueled vehicles where empty tanks or canisters are exchanged for full ones, such as for hydrogen-powered vehicles. The project's educational impacts include enhancements of curricula and laboratory experiences, workforce development, and student diversity.",

In the BSI, when a vehicle can gets a charged battery it leaves its spent battery for recharging, to be used by a future battery swap. Models and algorithms were developed for four problem areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(A1) How can a vehicle be routed from an origin (O) to a destination (D) without running out of charge given that a fully charged battery has a maximum range of, say, R miles and battery swaps can only occur within the range;</li>\n<li>(A2) Using the routing algorithms from area A1, how can we route and schedule EV bus trips, or EV pickup/delivery truck trips, given now battery swaps must take place within a given range R;</li>\n<li>(A3) Again, using the routing algorithms from A1, route large numbers of trips form many origins to many destinations, still respecting the range constraints, while allowing vehicles to reserve a charged battery at specific facilities along the way from each O to corresponding D; and</li>\n<li>(A4) While facility locations are given for areas A1-A3, this last area explored algorithms to optimally locate facilities to optimize respective measures of performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some examples illustrating project results are given in Figures 1 &ndash; 5.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For A1 area, we show in Figure 1 that because of detouring for recharging, we show the optimal route may contain cycles and hence we refer to this route as the <em>shortest EV walk</em> on the network.</li>\n<li>For A2 area, because of limited battery charge, or limited vehicle range, the bus in Figure 2 needs recharging to complete time-compatible service trips. The project developed integer programming models and column generation approaches to solve realistic problems.</li>\n<li>Computational experiments with the approximate dynamic programming based algorithms for area A3, where routing from O to D considers anticipated total OD demands, which may be referred to as <em>systems optimal routing</em>, performs better than a policy where each vehicle uses its own shortest walk, which may be referred to as greedy, or <em>user optimal routing</em>. As Figure 3 shows, systems optimal routing is most effective, up to 23% improvements in average delay, but when either there are too many batteries in the system, or when there are too few batteries system optimal is very close to user optimal.</li>\n<li>Finally, regarding optimal location of recharging facilities, several versions of the problem were studied; Figure 4 shows the problems researched. The research team has developed algorithms for optimally locating on lines and trees, Figure 5 shows an example of a comb tree with discrete demand points; with localization regions for optimal location of five, the minimum necessary, facilities. The optimization problem of exactly locations within the localization set can be formulated as a shortest path problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The project results can be used in the design and operations of an infrastructure for recharging batteries.
