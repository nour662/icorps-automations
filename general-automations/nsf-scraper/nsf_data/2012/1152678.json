 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will study the feasibility for commercialization of an intelligent reconfigurable modular robot system called iMobot, which was originally developed at the University of California, Davis. Robotics has grown beyond automation to encompass systems that are self-reliant, reconfigurable, mobile, intelligent, and aware of their environment. iMobot has four degrees of freedom capable of full mobility and assembly into clusters. Because of its flexibility, modularity, and reconfigurability iMobot is an ideal platform for many research and teaching programs at colleges and universities. iMobot allows researchers to study artificial intelligence, swarm technology, robot collaboration, mobile networking, sensor fusion, gait simulation, and programming for re-configurability. Each module has am open architecture, with a processor capable of embedded Linux. Users can customize software and accessories for their specific needs.  Proposed product feasibility research includes adaptable connectivity between modules, intelligent plug-and-play sensors, a robust and lightweight chassis, along with re-configurability. In this proposed Phase II project, a professional design team will develop necessary technology related to assembling into clusters including mechanical design, electrical interface, sensors, algorithms, control and control software and customer interface.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is great. This proposed project will be one of the first attempts to scale up an intelligent reconfigurable modular robot for commercial deployment. The initial market for iMobot will be for university research and teaching. With a standardized hardware base using an open architecture users will be able to more widely share their work with each other, and create a valuable open educational resource. The future release of different iMobot versions will be for life-saving rescue and search operations in the first responder system, and for K-12 education. Robotics is an interdisciplinary field. The unique full mobility and reconfigurability of iMobot are very appealing. Modules can be used alone or in collaboration with others, making it a flexible and scalable educational tool. Because of the homogeneous nature of modular robotics, the cost of manufacturing is reduced through production of a large volume of similar parts. By introducing students to interesting robotic projects with affordable hardware platforms, which involve a variety of math, physics, information technology, and engineering principles, we can excite their imagination and give them confidence to pursue STEM careers, especially for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged groups.",
