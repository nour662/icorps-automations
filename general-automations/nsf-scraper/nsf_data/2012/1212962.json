 "awd_abstract_narration": "The memory system continues to be a major performance and power\r\nbottleneck in nearly all computing systems. And, it is becoming\r\nincreasingly more so with major application, architecture, and\r\ntechnology trends. Embedded applications that acquire and\r\nprocess real-time data, Internet and cloud applications that have to\r\nanalyze large databases, and the exa-scale era HPC applications that\r\nneed to crunch voluminous data sets are just a few examples of\r\nincreasingly data-intensive applications that require high memory\r\ncapacity, performance, and energy efficiency. Thus, the well-known \r\nmemory wall problem has become even more difficult to surmount and\r\nneeds a fundamental rethinking of the memory hierarchy design for future\r\ncomputing platforms.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to fundamentally and holistically\r\nrethink the design of the entire memory hierarchy taking into consideration\r\nthe emerging device/memory technologies and to exploit the design trade-offs\r\nat different layers of the system stack -- from devices to micro-architecture,\r\ncompilers and runtime systems. The solution will cover innovations in\r\narchitecting and optimizing the entire memory path consisting of the caches,\r\non-chip networks, memory controller and main memory. The objective\r\nis to enable 100X improvement in memory capacity over the next\r\ndecade, while providing 5X improvement in performance and\r\n10X improvement in energy efficiency. The proposed research has the potential to transform the design of\r\nnext-generation memory systems for the multi-core era, which is expected\r\nto be a ubiquitous part of the entire IT sector.\r\nThe cross-cutting nature of this research can foster new research directions\r\nin several areas, spanning technology/energy-aware design, computer architecture,\r\ncompilers, and system/application software.  With the memory system forming\r\nthe backbone of nearly every envisioned future application domain, the\r\nbroader impact of this research can accelerate the design and deployment\r\nof future applications. This project will enable transfer of research\r\nresults to industry, enhance undergraduate and graduate student training\r\nincluding under-represented students, and contribute to the development of new\r\nresearch and teaching tools.",
