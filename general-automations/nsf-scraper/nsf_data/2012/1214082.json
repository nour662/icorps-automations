 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Brian Fields at the University of Illinois and Professor Lloyd Knox at the University of California Davis.\r\n\r\nThe theory of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the lightest elements--hydrogen, helium, and lithium--in the first seconds of the big bang. BBN predictions for cosmic light-element abundances are in broad agreement with observations; this concordance is a major success of the hot big bang model. Moreover, BBN provides a measure of the ordinary matter (\"baryon\") content of the universe, as well as total content in relativistic particles (\"radiation\") in both visible and invisible form (e.g., neutrinos and any other forms of \"dark light\"). In the past decade, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has emerged as a precise and independent measure of cosmic baryons. Comparing BBN and CMB baryon measures thus has provided a new fundamental test of the hot big bang cosmology, and reveal a \"lithium problem.\" This BBN/CMB connection is now poised to open qualitatively new possibilities.  Recent and upcoming measurements of the CMB for the first time will simultaneously probe not only cosmic baryons, but also cosmic radiation as well as the helium abundance itself. This will enable powerful new tests of cosmology: for the first time, the predictions of BBN can be tested entirely with very precise CMB data. Agreement would dramatically demonstrate the consistency of the standard cosmology, while any difference probes new physics.  Professors Fields and Knox will both evaluate and interpret the BBN-CMB comparison, develop tools to efficiently and accurately compare BBN and CMB data. For the first time, a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach will be used to evaluate BBN uncertainties; this will allow a direct and consistent means of combining BBN predictions and CMB data and statistically characterizing the results. As part of this analysis, a new open-source BBN code will be produced, tested, and publicly released.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that this work will have substantial broader impacts.  A publicly available open source BBN code will be released. Moreover, new and strong links will be forged among the CMB and early-universe particle astrophysics communities, and more widely among the particle astrophysics, cosmology, and astronomy communities. Graduate students, both in formal courses in research mentoring, will be trained to synthesize these approaches and to work in an interdisciplinary way. In addition, Profs. Fields will maintain vigorous, sustained outreach programs which include school visits and public lectures bringing this forefront science to a wider audience.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBig-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the origin of the lightest elements--hydrogen, helium, and lithium--in the early Universe.  The abundances of these elements and their isotopes are sensitive to all known fundamental interactions, and to the total cosmic radiation content, at times of seconds to minutes.  Using known laboratory physics, Standard BBN precisely predict the light-element abundances.  These theoretical predictions are tested by the observed light-element abundances and by measurements, and independently by the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB).  This enables a powerful new tests of cosmology.  Agreement would dramatically confirm the consistency of the standard cosmology, while any difference probes new physics in the dark sector.\n\nFor intellectual merit, We investigated BBN and CMB constraints on the dark sector in two ways.  (1) We studied dark radiation via placing BBN constraints on axion-like particles.  (2) We examined BBN and dark matter in the context of Supersymmetric theories.  Both of these studies improved existing limits, and probed regimes beyond the reach of terrestrial accelerators.  \n\nTurning to standard BBN, we revised all aspects of the problem:  the theoretical calculations, the nuclear reaction rates, and the procedure for statistical comparison with light element abundances and CMB data.  Using CMB results from the final two Planck CMB data releases, we showed that the observed light elements deuterium and helium-4 are in good agreement, while the lithium abundance remains discordant--this is the lithium problem.  Going beyond the standard picture to allow for possible extra radiation in the early universe, we tightened the limits on this dark radiation.\n\nOur broader impacts include outreach efforts by the PI.  These included public astrophysics talks at the Saturday Physics for Everyone series hosted by University of Illinois Physics.   In addition, the PI gave several astrophysics and cosmology workshops to students incarcerated in the Danville Correctional Center, a nearby state prison.  This engagement was made possible through the University of Illinois Educational Justice Project (EJP) prison education group.  EJP students work toward college credit and show enormous engagement and dedication.  These intense 3-hour classes were well-attended and highly interactive.  As a result, the Illinois Astronomy department has since formed an active prison outreach group, one of the only such groups in the country.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian D Fields"
