 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant provides funding for the development of novel ultrasonic vibration-assisted laser processes for the surface modifications of advanced materials, including light alloys, metal matrix composites (MMCs), and porous ceramics. The proposed processing approach is expected to achieve refined grain structure in light alloys, deeper penetration of ceramic reinforcement in metal matrix composites, and denser crack-free surfaces in porous ceramics. The research project will investigate the effect of combined laser operation and ultrasonic vibrations on the development of microstructure and properties of these materials. The microstructural features such as grain size (light alloys), depth of particle penetration (MMCs), and depth of infiltration (porous ceramics) will be characterized using combination of experimental and computational approaches. The effect of these microstructural features on hardness, strength, corrosion/wear resistance, and residual stress state of the modified surfaces will be systematically investigated. Major emphasis of the proposed activities will be on establishing processing-microstructure-properties relationships for these advanced materials. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the proposed project will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in laser surface engineering for improving surface properties of materials. The development of these new ultrasonic vibration assisted laser surface modification processes will accelerate the utilization of surface modified light alloys, MMCs, and porous ceramics in wider applications requiring improved performance. In addition, the proposed project will provide unique hands-on-experience opportunities to the diverse groups of undergraduate and graduate students to prepare them for future career in this important field of manufacturing research. The results of this research project will be widely disseminated to the academic, research, and manufacturing community through journal publications, conference presentations, and proceedings.",
