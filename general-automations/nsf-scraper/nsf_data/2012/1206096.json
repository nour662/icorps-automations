 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical research and education on fractionalized spin liquid phases in frustrated quantum magnets.  The research is stimulated by recent discoveries of several candidate spin liquid materials with spins residing on two-dimensional and three-dimensional lattices.  The PI aims to expand the available toolbox of wave functions for such fractionalized phases using a parton approach.  In this approach, the microscopic spin or boson operator is split into auxiliary quark-like fields, which are taken to be deconfined in mean field and are then glued together by a projection recovering the physical Hilbert space.  Besides popular Gutzwiller-projected slave fermion states, the PI will also use projected Schwinger boson wave functions that are strong candidates near magnetically ordered phases, as well as novel wave functions motivated from Majorana slave fermion approaches that can further enrich the pool of states with gapless spinons.  Another interesting direction is possible combination with novel entanglement-based numerical approaches.\r\n\r\nIn a separate thrust, the PI will work to develop a better understanding of gapless fractionalized phases where the emergent gauge fields are also gapless, which are some of the most challenging cases where analytical approaches are not under full control.  The PI will build upon an example of an Exciton Bose Liquid phase in models with pure ring exchanges, where the parton-gauge approach can be brought to completion and also compared with non-parton approaches.  The study will address a number of open questions in the Exciton Bose Liquid theory and will use these to learn about gapless parton-gauge systems.\r\n\r\nThe PI will also explore unusual phase transitions in statistical mechanics problems with topological terms, combining analytical duality approaches and numerical Monte Carlo techniques in a powerful way.  The focus will be on models with particles that have mutual statistical interactions.  Such models arise in studies of topological phases and their phase transformations and also in effective field theories of frustrated quantum antiferromagnets.  The research will help to understand unconventional quantum phase transitions of much recent interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical research and education focusing on unusual quantum states of matter that show a kind of fractionalization phenomenon. In a sense, electrons are like tiny spinning tops quantified in the term spin. They also carry a unit of electric charge. Fractionalization results when electrons appear to behave as though they were split into two independent particles, one that has electric charge but has no spin and one that has spin but no charge. Fractionalization was discovered experimentally for electrons constrained to move in a plane in a semiconductor interface and exposed to strong magnetic field. Similar phenomenon had long been conjectured to occur naturally in materials.  Recently several candidates were found.  This project aims to develop theoretical and computational toolbox to discover and characterize fractionalized quantum phases in models and experimental materials.  It will also study transformations that can occur among such states that lie outside the standard theory of phase transitions. \r\n\r\nThe discovery of new quantum states of electronic matter in materials may lead to new technologies. The manipulation of some quantum states of electronic matter may lead to a new way to do computation, quantum computing, that would be potentially more powerful than existing computers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project advanced our understanding of exotic phases of quantum matter in several directions.  One of the main thrusts was developing so-called dual perspectives on quantum many-body systems where we reformulate the problem in terms of topological defects such as vortices in superfluids and hedgehogs in magnets.  We demonstrated the power of such duality approaches for understanding and discovering new phases of quantum matter.  Thus, we proposed a simple picture of so-called Integer Quantum Hall insulator of bosons in two dimensions as a condensate of bound states of vortices and charges.  We generalized these ideas to topological insulators of bosons in three dimensions where the relevant topological defects are hedgehogs.  In both two and three dimensions, we also discovered three-dimensional fractionalized topological insulators.  In all these cases, we constructed explicit models realizing such physics and performed detailed numerical studies of their phase diagrams and phase transitions.\n\nWe also contributed to exciting new developments applying such dual approaches to fermionic particles.  We provided an explicit proof of a conjectured duality between two seemingly unrelated theories in two dimensions:  The first theory has a single Dirac cone with weak interactions, e.g., as found on the surface of three-dimensional electronic topological insulators.  The second theory has a single Dirac cone coupled to a fluctuating photon field, which is essentially a two-dimensional version of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) (the two-dimensional version is actually more challenging as the fermions and photons remain strongly coupled on all energy scales).  The two theories are remarkably related by an explicit change of variables, allowing us in particular to make non-trivial predictions for the strongly coupled QED theory.  The Dirac-QED duality has yielded a clear picture of unusual phases possible on the surfaces of three-dimensional electronic topological insulators and has also provided a new understanding of so-called composite fermi liquid in the half-filled Landau level of the two-dimensional electron gas, thus unifying three milestones of physics: quantum electrodynamics, topological insulators, and fractional quantum Hall effect.\n\nWe also pursued studies of gapless fractionalized phases in strongly interacting systems which have emergent excitations carrying fractional quantum numbers and effectively forming some itinerant state.  Here we focused primarily on numerical studies of candidate models for such behaviors.  Thus we studied how electrons go from a metallic state to an insulating state upon increasing Coulomb repulsion.  We found that this transition can be continuous if the insulating state is a spin liquid where electrons effectively shed their charge while their spin degrees of freedom are still roaming around.  We also studied a two-dimensional electron gas with Coulomb interactions in magnetic field at filling fraction one half (i.e., the famous half-filled Landau level problem).  We provided the strongest evidence to date for the composite fermi liquid phase in this system and confirmed a new picture that the composite fermions have a Dirac-like nature, thus connecting to the recent developments from the dual perspectives described above.   We expect that the fermionic dualities as well as direct numerical studies will bring new light also on other gapless fractionalized phases, such as gapless spin liquids, Bose-metals, vortex metals, and electronic non-Fermi-liquids.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Olexei I Motrunich"
