 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding establishes a new CISE Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site focused on cyber security at the Dakota State University.  The site will provide a diverse pool of in-service high school computer teachers in South Dakota with a quality experience conducting cutting-edge research in cyber security.  The teachers will develop research based materials and activities which they will incorporate into their classes during the academic year.  State secondary computing curricula will be updated to include cyber security and outreach will be conducted to reach a wide audience of teachers and students within the state.  This site is co-funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Program.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the expertise of the faculty. The project team has significant related research and experience in educational applications and K-12 school outreach. The projects are in research areas that are in an area of national priority and of interest to teachers and their students. The project also has the potential to make a significant contribution to the discipline of computer science education through the development, implementation, and testing of materials and methods for infusing cyber security into the secondary computing curriculum.\r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to teachers and the incorporation of sound instructional models into the K-12 schools. The project includes many activities and outreach efforts that should impact an area that is somewhat geographically isolated and that is surrounded by a diverse population. The project has the potential to create a sustainable partnership between the university and schools that can provide long-lasting benefits to the community.",
