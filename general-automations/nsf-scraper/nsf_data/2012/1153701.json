 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the college is providing structured support for a cohort of financially needy students who demonstrate academic potential for completing a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) associate degree program. Approximately 60 to 80 eligible students are being awarded scholarships of up to $5,000 per year to enroll in programs leading to employment in a STEM field or transfer to a STEM baccalaureate program. Targeted programs include biotechnology, chemical technology, computer science/information technology, drafting, electronics and electrical technology, engineering, geospatial technology, industrial automation, manufacturing technology, mathematics, mechanical technology, nanofabrication technology, and natural science. \r\n\r\nIn addition to financial assistance, the project is providing activities to encourage retention through program completion that include (a) a mentoring program that gives scholarship recipients an opportunity to interact with professionals in STEM fields, (b) a series of lectures and discussion panels with STEM professionals, (c) workshops on academic and career topics, (d) field trips to industries and four-year colleges and universities, (e) intensive faculty advising, (f) a newly formed student organization (STEM Club), and (g) informal study groups. \r\n\r\nProject objectives are to: \r\n(1) Increase the financial support available to address the unmet financial need of students enrolled in eligible associate degree STEM programs; \r\n(2) Retain at least 85% of S-STEM scholarship recipients from the spring semester to the fall semester of a two-year program; \r\n(3) Provide structured support for the S-STEM cohort so that at least 85% of the students will graduate with a STEM associate degree and/or transfer to a four-year institution; \r\n(4) Increase opportunities for S-STEM scholars to interact with, and receive mentoring from, STEM professionals; and \r\n(5) Create awareness of STEM career opportunities, particularly for students from underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: S-STEM scholars participate in project activities as a STEM learning community cohort, supported by the faculty members from the science, computer science and information technology, mathematics, and technology divisions. The activities bring together students from different STEM majors for interdisciplinary engagement, expanding their knowledge of the impact of other disciplines on their chosen field and creating awareness of career pathways open to them through advanced education. These students are being better prepared for the STEM workplace through interaction not only with faculty and other students but also with STEM professionals.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The interdisciplinary learning experiences outside the classroom help form a foundation on which to build more extensive interdisciplinary connections within the curriculum. Relationships with the business community and four-year institutions are being strengthened, and the activities can be expanded for students outside the S-STEM project. Through dissemination of activities and results, this project is serving as a learning community model for other community colleges that offer a large selection of STEM programs for a diverse population and are attempting to bridge the various disciplines with interdisciplinary learning activities to better prepare students for continuing education and the workplace.",

While annual reviews of the program focused on student retention and success, the program evaluation uncovered significant transformations in the attitudes and behaviors of the faculty mentors that extend to other classes the faculty teach.  Some merits also translate to societal benefits. \n\n1.  Understanding the influential role of personal reflection was transformative for the faculty mentors.  Prior to the grant participants were not aware of how powerful reflection is for students. The ePortfolios became an effective tool for promoting reflection. Reflection and branding supported self-awareness, goal setting and decision-making.  The Co-PIs learned to make reflection a requirement and to use a structured format.\n\n 2.  The mentoring was helpful to students. Learning how impactful the mentoring is changed faculty members? interactions with students.  For many students, even just talking to a faculty member was uncomfortable and scary.  Mandating the mentoring reduced student anxieties and gave students practice talking to professionals.  Prior to the grant, some faculty had little personal interaction with students. Now they ask all students to meet with them individually, including those in online courses. Faculty said they are consciously giving mentoring conversations more time because they realize they are not just being nice, rather these interactions are critical to students? success.\n\n 3.  Faculty Mentors experienced professional support and satisfaction from their involvement in the cohort.   The Mentors did not anticipate the strong, positive effect on themselves.  Several cited the professional camaraderie of the group as professionally gratifying.  Faculty enjoyed conversations with students, which made their relationships stronger; faculty became more tolerant and personable in the classroom. Faculty need and value the feedback they got from the group.\n\n 4.  Faculty members gained increased knowledge and appreciation for the positive effects of the support services (tutoring, career development, transfer advising) on student success.  Faculty now allow support services to access students during class time. By inviting support services to class, faculty model the importance of the services to all students, and students seek these services after meeting the staff. \n\n 5.  Personal relationships between faculty and students had an immense impact on both student success and faculty satisfaction.  Spending time in the group meetings each month listening to one another was beneficial to faculty and students.  Both felt supported, felt less alone, and were more motivated to succeed. \n\n 6.  Rather than decrease over time, faculty investment in the program increased.  For the program to stay fresh and grow with the students, the program had to be continually reviewed and modified.  The grant was written with more time and compensation at the start expecting the effort to level out or be reduced, but the opposite was true. Faculty volunteered their time to continue the grant, because they valued the positive effects on student retention and completion.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe broader impacts of the grant are apparent at the individual, organizational and societal levels. Individual impacts on students included personal skill development and persistence toward their goals for careers in STEM fields.  Helping more students, especially women, minority and high economic need students, persist in a STEM field is helpful to society by supporting social mobility for disadvantaged people and expanding diversity of thought for all involved.\n\n 1.  Faculty are maintaining relationships with alumni of the program which was not typical in their prior years at the college. The stronger relationships are extending well past graduation, as was evidenced by alumni participation in the end-of-grant reception held in December 2016 and anecdotes shared by faculty mentors.\n\n 2.  STEM Scholars will have ongoing impact through the STEM Club. Scholars came to be counted on as tour guides and panelists for special events, they volunteer in the community, and they have launched a pollinator garden project that will continue beyond the end of the grant.  The pollinator garden will beautify the campus, provide an educational opportunity, and have a positive environmental impact.  It will primarily be a tool to maintain some group cohesion and support for students. Being involved helps with retention.\n\n 3.  S-STEM successes helped the College connect to other organizations and funded programs. Outreach to external organizations throughout the grant benefitted individual students and the college as a whole.  LCCC now has stronger partnerships with Bucknell, Bloomsburg and East Stroudsburg Universities.  STEM Scholars are already enrolled in ESU?s NSF funded Clear Path program.\n\n 4.  Intellectual Merits of the STEM initiative are shaping curriculum.  After learning about the importance of reflection, one faculty member revised the Introduction to Computers and Applications course that reaches 500 students each fall to include more reflection.  The STEM Scholars ePortfolio pilot helped the college expand the portfolio initiative to include over 1100 students, at least 14 unique faculty and 18 unique courses/groups including the environmental science major and the computer-networking program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/20/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Loughman"
