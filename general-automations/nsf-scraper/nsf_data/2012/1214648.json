The focus in this project will be on two promising ways forward.  One will be to use observations of gamma-rays towards the luminous satellites of the Milky Way in order to constrain or detect weak-scale thermal dark matter.  Weak-scale thermal dark matter is the most widely studied dark-matter candidate and is motivated by particle-physics models at the high (electroweak-scale) energies currently being probed at the Large Hadron Collider.  The other way forward will be to develop simplified models to describe dark-matter halo density profiles in the presence of significant self-interactions and compare to observations.  As part of the project, the PI will provide a map between these preferred models and the underlying particle-physics models in which such phenomenology is realized.  \r\n\r\nThis project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  The PI will develop a cosmology and particle-physics cluster for the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (i.e., the \"COSMOS Program\" at UC Irvine).  COSMOS is a program for motivated high-school students and currently has a cluster in astronomy at UC Irvine but none in particle physics.  Based on input from faculty teaching the astronomy cluster, it is envisioned that a particle physics and cosmology module will be highly subscribed.",
