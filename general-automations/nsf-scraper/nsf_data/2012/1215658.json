 "awd_abstract_narration": "This pilot research project seeks to examine active tectonic processes in a complex, subduction-dominated plate boundary zone in the Philippines island arc through analysis of the surface deformation field using high-precision GPS measurements. The project takes advantage of a newly available suite of data from a 240-station network of continuous and campaign GPS sites in the Philippine plate boundary zone, collected by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), together with international collaborators. The project builds on a successful research collaboration between Indiana University, PHIVOLCS, and two research institutes in Taiwan. The work will focus on (1) improvement of regional plate motion and intraplate deformation models for the Philippine island arc; (2) evaluation of strain partitioning between subduction-related compression and intra-arc shear deformation in Luzon, including assessment of post-seismic transient effects associated with the large (Mw 7.7) 1990 Luzon earthquake; and (3) assessment of spatially variable subduction zone coupling along the Manila and Philippine trenches and its impact on earthquake potential. This proposal seeks to extend and expand the ongoing studies in Luzon through analysis of existing crustal deformation data, in collaboration with Philippine and Taiwanese counterparts. Tasks include (1) extending kinematic modeling of elastic block interaction to include the entire Philippine archipelago; (2) developing 3-D deforming block models of fault-related deformation at the Philippine Fault and interaction with subduction boundaries; and (3) examining spatially variable coupling along the Manila and Philippine subduction zones through dynamic modeling of subduction-zone creeping and locked segments. The expected models of plate boundary earthquake potential can be used as input for ground-motion and tsunami-generation models.\r\n\r\nThis project has significant societal impacts in the form of improved methods for detecting fault-related deformation and subduction-zone activity in active plate boundary zones. In particular, these observations will provide critical information for assessment of long-term seismic hazards for the Philippines.PHIVOLCS and other Philippine collaborators provides an avenue for technology transfer to colleagues in the developing world. Because of the large population at risk from future earthquakes and related secondary effects, the research conducted as part of this project could have significant impacts in hazard mitigation for the Philippines. The project would provide support for students at Indiana University and ongoing science outreach activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project invoved a scientific collaboration with the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) and the Institute of Earth Sciences, Academica Sinica (Taiwan) to examine active geologic processes in a complex portion of the circum-Pacific \"Ring of Fire\".  The project takes advantage of a unique, newly available suite of high-precision surveys using Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements.  The project is specifically targeted at (1) improvement of models of tectonic plate interaction in a complex plate boundary zone, and (2) assessing the degree of coupling between plates that in turn constrains the risk from major, plate-boundary earthquakes.\n\nThrough our collaboration with Philippine and Taiwan colleagues, we have assembled a suite of over 200 GPS measurements and 300 earthquake source mechanism solutions that constrain a new model of present-day deformation in the Philippine region.  This model estimates block motions, rates of slip along major geologic faults, and degree of coupling along tectonic plate boundaries surrounding the Philippine island arc.\n\nWe have obtained the following conclusions:\n\nThe rate of convergence along the Manila Trench decreases from ~100mm/yr at the northern tip of Luzon to &lt;20 mm/yr at its southern termination, most likely a result of the ongoing collision between the Philppines and the Palawan-Calamian block.\nSlip rate estimates for the Philippine fault range from 25-40 mm/yr, significantly higher than that estimated from geologic methods.  The Philippine Fault system appears to accommodate the oblique northward component of subduction along the Philippine Trench, producing nearly orthogonal westward subduction along the Philippine Trench.\nOur model provides new estimates of convergence along the Manila Trench (~21-95 mm/yr), East Luzon Trough (~12 mm/yr), Philippine Trench (~30 mm/yr), and intra-arc motion along the left-lateral strike-slip Philippine Fault (~29-40 mm/yr), the Northern Cordillera Fault (~18-30 mm/yr), and the Digdig Fault (~17-25 mm/yr).\nCoupling estimates for plate pairs range from nearly 100% locking along some sections of the Philippine Fault (except for creeping sections in Masbate and Leyte Island), the Digdig Fault, and the Marikina Fault. Along the Manila Trench, a strongly locked patched is obtained at ~16&deg;N and near the southern termination of the trench off Mindoro Island (Figure 2).  The Philippine Trench appear to be predominantly uncoupled, with a strongly locked patch resolved offshore eastern Mindanao (at ~7.5&deg;N).\nWe can use the estimates of coupling along the plate boundaries to estimate the total potential seismic accumulation rate along each of the two subduction zones, equivalent to a magnitude Mw 8.4 to 8.9 earthquake per 100 years.  This has significance for estimating tsunami hazard in the region\n\n\nThe project has also supported graduate training for Ph.D. candidate Anna Nowicki      (Indiana University), ongoing collaboration with scientific staff of the Philippine      Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), including hosting two      visits by PHIVOLCS geophysicist Teresito Bacolcol, and continuing post-graduate colloboration      with former graduate student Gerald Galgana (now at AIR Worldwide).\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/24/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael W Hamburger"
