 "awd_abstract_narration": "Market design--economic engineering--has been successful in the redesign of real-world \"two-sided matching markets,\" including the matching of doctors to residencies and the assignment of students to schools. A recent and growing literature has shown that the methods and results of two-sided matching theory extend to substantially more general settings, including \"trading networks\" in which agents negotiate over contracts.\r\n\r\nUnlike two-sided matching markets, trading networks feature intermediaries, agents who both buy and sell in the market. These intermediaries may be intermediate producers (as in most economic models of supply chains) or may simply facilitate trade (e.g., through provision of information). Although the presence of intermediaries is the defining distinction between the matching-in-networks model and the previous two-sided frameworks, the analysis of intermediaries in these matching models has been limited.\r\n\r\nThis research will further our understanding of the behavior and impact of market intermediaries. Theoretical work using the matching-in-networks framework will be supplemented with detailed empirical analyses using plant-level microdata on production networks, in order to gain insight into the magnitudes of intermediaries' effects on welfare. Simulated counterfactual models will be developed when theory does not provide sharp predictions.\r\n\r\nThis work will inform and support new applications of market design approaches to real-world intermediated matching markets. One focus will be understanding how \"local\" perturbations (e.g., intermediary entrance and exit) affect the \"global\" structure of networks; another will be the identification and reduction of rent seeking by intermediaries.\r\n\r\nIn addition to enabling novel work in applied market design, this research will promote joint work between computer scientists and economists working in the theory and practice of market design.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe increased connectivity of the modern world has a significant impact on markets.  More goods are traded, at higher frequencies, and for higher stakes, than ever before.  This means it's very important to understand why markets succeed and why they fail.  The subject of this grant was to provide new theoretical insights into the structural properties of markets that predict success and failure, and the application of these insights into the design of real-world markets.  This research agenda requires a diverse set of skills, from computer scientists who have developed tools for studying the performance of large and combinatorial systems, to economists who understand the reaction of market participants to market structures.  An important meta-goal of this work was to foster communication between computer scientists and economists both within the context of this grant and within the community more broadly.\n\nWhen markets fail, it is often because of inherent combinatorial structures in the preferences of the participants.  For example, if a participant in a cloud computing market requires both CPU time and memory to complete her task, then a cloud market with cheap CPU time but expensive memory resources may fail to satisfy her.  In general, preferences like these, in which the participant requires multiple items to generate value, are called complementarities and they can be highly destructive for markets.  Co-PI Immorlica proved that, none-the-less, large auction markets with uncertain participation succeed even in the presence of these complementarities.  Her work builds upon that of co-PI Budish who showed that, in large auction markets, truth-telling (e.g., bidding your value for an item in an auction) is often in the best-interest of the participants.  In matching markets, such as dating or labor markets, co-PI Kominers examined when complementarities can be resolved via a hidden structure.  That is, although the preferences appear to have complementarities, this is only because they are a projection of a higher-dimensional space of well-behaved preferences.  \n\nAnother potential failure in markets is their complexity.  If the rules are difficult to comprehend, participants might not know how to interact in the market.  Some markets address this concern by guaranteeing that truth-telling is in a participant's best interest.  Co-PI Kominers shows that markets with truth-telling additionally incentivize participants to make optimal ex ante investments.  Another way to address this concern is to develop markets with very simple rules.  For example, a market for goods could simply post prices for various bundles making the participation decisions of the agents simple.  Co-PI Immorlica showed that, while bundling can not guarantee optimal revenue for the seller, there is a small set of bundling options that guarantee the seller a constant fraction of her optimal revenue.  The co-PIs also investigated other market failure scenarios like information asymmetries and costly search.\n\nThe co-PIs also made significant advances in applying the theory of markets to modern market design problems.  Co-PI Eric Budish?s research on high frequency trading and financial market design argues that there is a simple structural flaw in the design of modern financial markets &ndash; continuous &shy;time trading &ndash; and proposes as an alternative frequent batch auctions: uniform&shy;-price double auctions conducted at frequent but discrete time intervals, e.g., every 0.1 seconds or potentially even faster.
