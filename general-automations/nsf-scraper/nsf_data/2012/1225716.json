 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to adapt and implement use of a video game for improved student learning of engineering digital systems concepts at the undergraduate level and for use in motivating pre-college students (grade 8-12) to pursue electrical engineering, computer engineering, or computer science degrees in college. The objectives include (1) Create new student learning materials and strategies by expanding the digital systems video game, PlanetK, to include more advanced levels that address circuit minimization and sequential system design, and to vertically integrate a conceptual or pedagogical approach on digital system design into sequences of courses in electrical and computer engineering (ECE) and computer science (CS) curricula; (2) Enhance the understanding of digital systems by diverse populations through adaptation and implementation of the video game, PlanetK, beyond a single institution through crowdsourcing to the ECE and CS programs at minority-serving institutions; (3) Contribute to the knowledge base on university and precollege student attitudes toward the use of video games as a motivator for pursuing an ECE or CS major, and determine the effect on student performance, especially on students from underrepresented groups; (4) Implement PlanetK in pre-college outreach efforts for middle and high schools; and (5) Synthesize and disseminate findings across the TAMU System engineering programs, and programs across the nation and the world. \r\n\r\nThe project will advance discovery and understanding of the impact of video games to improve student learning in ECE and CS disciplines, broaden participation by under-represented minorities and benefit society by improving the understanding of digital systems and engineering for those who do not choose engineering careers, but are part of the non-technically degreed US population.",
