 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide engineers with an improved ability to determine whether or not a modern geomembrane liner waste containment system can maintain its integrity when subjected to a strong earthquake.  Current practice for evaluating the ability of waste containment systems to withstand earthquake loading employs an empirical index of performance rather than direct calculation of the loads (stresses and strains) on the geomembrane liner.  This award will use centrifuge model testing to evaluate input parameters essential to direct calculation of liner stresses and strains and to validate a numerical model to evaluate these stresses and strains.  Validation of the model will include validation of the influence of stress (or strain) concentrations due to seams, patches, and anchor trenches on liner performance.  Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES Project Warehouse/data repository (http://www.nees.org).\r\n\r\nThis award offers the promise of a new paradigm for seismic design of waste containment systems, transforming current engineering practice for geomembrane liner system seismic design from an empirical process that depends upon an unreliable index of performance to a performance-based seismic design procedure in which the seismic loads on the geomembrane are directly evaluated.  The project may also have a transformative impact on landfill liner construction quality assurance (CQA) practices, as experimental verification of strain concentration factors for seams, patches, and anchor trenches in geomembranes should lead to new guidelines on where it is appropriate to cut seam samples for CQA testing (e.g. never at the top of a slope or near an anchor trench) and perhaps on the frequency of such testing.   By facilitating more rational performance-based seismic design and CQA, the project should enhance environmental protection and facilitate the development of more effective design and construction practices for waste containment systems subject to earthquake loading. This award is part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, a numerical model for the performance of the synthetic (plastic) membranes used in modern waste containment systems, referred to herein as geomembrane liners, subject to earthquakes and other extreme loads has been validated.  Geomembranes are commonly used in landfills and for other environmentally critical applications.  Current methods used in engineering practice for design of geomembranes subject to extreme loads employ simplistic analyses that only provide an approximate measure of performance and do not explicitly calculate the tensile forces on the geomembrane that can threaten its integrity.  Application in landfill engineering practice of the model validated herein will provide a more appropriate measure of geomembrane performance as it directly calculates the tensile forces and strains in the geomembrane that present the greatest threat to geomembrane integrity. \n\nThere were two important aspects of the model for performance based design of geomembranes that were validated on this project: a numerical model for predicting the average tensile strain induced in a geomembrane by extreme loads; and the concept of seam strain concentration factors, wherein the tensile strain adjacent to a geomembrane seam perpendicular to the applied tensile load is amplified such that it is significantly greater than the average tensile strain.  Data collected from a large scale centrifuge test on a model geomembrane-lined landfill, conducted on the NSF-supported Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) centrifuge facility at the University of California at Davis, provided data for validation of the numerical model for the average tensile strains induced in a geomembrane by waste settlement and seismic loading.  Laboratory experiments conducted on seamed geomembrane specimens employed an innovative Digital Image Correlation technique to measure strain concentrations adjacent to the seam.  The seam strain concentrations measured in these experiments were significantly greater than the strain concentratiosn reported in the literature on the basis of analytical studies.  This is an important finding, as it means that existing guidelines for the allowable tensile strain in geomembranes, which are based to some extent on the seam strain concentration factors from the analytical studies, are inadequate to protect the integrity of a geomembrane.  The implication of this finding for landfill engineering practice is that guidelines for the location of geomembrane seams in areas in which they are likely to be loaded in tension need to be strengthened.  Another implication of this finding is that guidelines for recovering seam samples for laboratory Quality Assurance (QA) testing need to be amended to prohibit the recovery of QA samples in areas expected to be loaded in tension.  The numerical model validated using the centrifuge model test may be employed to identify those areas where the geomembrane is likely to be loaded in tension.\n\nThis results from this project enhance the ability of landfill engineers to analyze and design geomembranes subject to extreme loading, and in particular for analysis and design of geomembranes subject to earthquake loading.  This, in turn, will increase public confidence in the ability of landfills and other waste containment systems to protect human health and the environment.  In this manner, the results of the project contribute to environmental protection and national security.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward Kavazanjian"
