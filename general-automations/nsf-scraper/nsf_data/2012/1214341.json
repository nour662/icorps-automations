 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors Sumit Das and Alfred Shapere at the University of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThis project involves the use of techniques of string theory and quantum field theory to understand quantum properties of gravity and properties of systems near phase transitions. In recent years, physicists have discovered an intimate relationship between quantum gravity as described by string theory and conventional quantum systems. This relationship has been used to understand many equilibrium and near-equilibrium properties of rather complicated systems near phase transitions, like superconductors or colliding heavy ions at high temperature, using methods of string theory. The present proposal involves novel methods which will shed light on properties of these systems far from equilibrium.  At the same time, the proposal aims to develop a deeper understanding of the quantum aspects of gravity by relating such aspects to systems which can be investigated using conventional methods of quantum mechanics. In a parallel direction, powerful methods of supersymmetry will be used to classify phase transitions and their related universal behavior.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include the training of graduate students and postdocs in cutting-edge research techniques and preparing them for research careers.   The investigators will give lectures and seminars on their research which are open to all, and will incorporate ideas gleaned from their research activities in the courses they teach.  The investigators will also continue their work to modernize the University of Kentucky's physics curriculum and to bring its students into contact with frontier research in these subjects.",
