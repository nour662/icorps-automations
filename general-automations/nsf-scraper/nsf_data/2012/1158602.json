 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides core support to the Board of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (BASC) to aid the science community and advise federal agencies on atmospheric sciences and climate research issues. The BASC strives to advance understanding of atmospheric science, meteorology, and climate; foster application of this knowledge to benefit the public; help ensure that U.S. research programs are responsive to scientific opportunities and the needs of the Nation; and help make scientific information more useful in government planning and decision-making. Thus this activity has substantial broader impacts.\r\n\r\nThe BASC is part of the National Academies, chartered by Congress in 1863 to provide independent science advice to government. The BASC uses volunteer experts to assist in the design of research studies and workshops and to review and assess findings and assess priorities. The BASC also facilitates US involvement in international research programs such as World Climate Research Program, Climate Variability and Predictability Program. For 2012-2015, it will continue to plan activities where objective, independent discussion and analysis are needed. Areas include severe weather, scientific understanding of climate change, observational systems, climate modeling and additional topics as requested. The BASC will seek opportunities to use its role as a neutral, independent body to encourage open discussion of issues.",
