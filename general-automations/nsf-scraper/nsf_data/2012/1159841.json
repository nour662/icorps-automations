 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal is to investigate both detection and improvement of DNA using a device known as cantilever sensor. We will investigate systematically the role of intense surface vibration on bound double stranded DNA behavior.  We hypothesize that the intense vibration will open up the molecule.  Currently we do such a reaction by heating.  Our preliminary work suggests that vibration directionally applied will cause DNA?s two parts to come apart.  We will investigate if a method of increasing the DNA on the sensor can be accomplished.  If these two goals are accomplished we may be able to detect DNA that is present in extremely small amounts.  The implication of such a capability is we can detect harmful bacteria quickly saving lives; detect human and animal diseases rapidly and inexpensively. \r\nIntellectual Merits:  Three merits are: (1) A new and cheaper approach will be developed for the detection of DNA at a very low level. (2) We will also develop a fundamental understanding of how vibration intensity affects DNA reaction, (3) Training of PhD students in the interdisciplinary area at the intersection of the broad field of nucleic acid chemistry (kinetics and thermodynamics), electromechanical resonators, and measurement science. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Students of various backgrounds ? high school, undergraduates in various disciplines ? will be exposed to DNA measurement techniques.  An important broad impact will be a new methodology that has sensitivity similar or better than the current expensive methods used in disease diagnosis and presence of harmful bacteria.",

The emphasis was on the latter, however. In earlier studies we found vibration properties of a cantilever biosensor exhibited very low nonspecific response which is an advantageous feature. The current effort was to take advantage of this specific property in releasing the bound target analyte, both proteins, and DNA. For proteins, we immobilized an antibody that would preferentially bind to it.  For the latter, a complementary DNA strand was immobilized on the sensor surface. \n\nThe detailed experimental study showed that a biological analyte can be more accurately measured by the use of the dynamic features of cantilever biosensor.  The primary impact is in medical diagnostics, food safety and measurement of a biological analyte in source water.  The study also showed that the use of sensor vibration in a particular way (high intensity of vibration) can release the target biological entity, thus suggesting the development of a superior method for bioseparation.  Both of these outcomes are expected to reduce cost and are likely to improve the human condition. \n\nExperiments with DNA showed that polymerase-catalyzed reaction can be conducted on the sensor and small strands hybridized to the sensor surface can be released by increasing the vibration intensity of the sensor. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/23/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Raj Mutharasan"
