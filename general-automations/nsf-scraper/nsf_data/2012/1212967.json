 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports the work of Professor Sunghee Lee at Iona College, concerning how supramolecular aggregates direct the crystallization of substances at a liquid-liquid interface. The research includes: (1) investigating the effect of surfactant monolayer structure upon crystallization by employing polymorphic organic crystal systems as reporters for subtle changes in monolayer structure; (2) studying the mechanism by which lipid bilayers in mesophases promote the crystallization of important protein targets through establishment of the droplet interface bilayer as a model; and (3) determining the nature and extent of interaction of ions with bilayers using the droplet interface bilayer model.\r\n\r\nThe research will enhance the body of empirical and systematic knowledge regarding arrangement of molecules which preferentially reside at the liquid-liquid interface. The understanding of molecular assemblies at the liquid-liquid interface will be an important contribution to fields which rely on these structures, such as biomimetic materials synthesis, electronics, diagnostics, drug delivery, and the plastic and pharmaceutical industries. Undergraduate students will perform research, co-author the relevant publications, and present their findings at national meetings. Thus, the research will impact the future career pathways in science available to numerous undergraduates, through enhanced availability and depth of research training at Iona College, a predominantly undergraduate institution.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Many natural and synthetic systems rely on the transport of small molecules across cellular membranes for their functional properties. Of intense interest in this realm is the permeability of water molecules across membranes, important to maintain organism homeostasis and to eliminate waste. We contributed studies that systematically develop a highly configurable model membrane: the droplet interface bilayer (DIB) system, used for osmotically induced water permeability investigations. The ease with which bilayers may be formed and from which permeability data may be amassed will help to situate DIB systems as useful experimental adjuncts to and complements of the plethora of ongoing molecular dynamics (MD) studies of permeability and other biophysical membrane properties. In another aspect of our research, the ability to produce desired crystal forms (such as various polymorphs, enantiomers, or solvates), is of high value to various chemical industries. Such ability to obtain consistent and controlled crystal habit (shape) and structure (e.g., polymorph) is highly sought after, particularly in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. By gaining a more complete understanding of how a surfactant monolayer or other ordered organic structure can direct the nucleation of particular crystal types, one can envision benefits in a number of commercially important areas. Our research findings have been disseminated to communities of interest via local, regional, national and international professional conferences and peer-reviewed publications with undergraduate co-authors. A total of 5 peer-reviewed publications are made with 18 undergraduate student co-authors (one of them is high school student). Over 85 presentations have been made by the PI and her undergraduate students, among which 39 presentations are made at the national level (e.g. ACS National meeting and National Conference for Undergraduate Research), 13 and 33 presentations at the regional and local level, respectively.</p>\n<p>The research funded under this proposal has been conducted at Iona College, an undergraduate institution, with undergraduate students as main participants in all aspects. The NSF support has allowed the PI to provide training and professional development opportunities for 35 undergraduates (21 women and 14 males) and 5 high school students to obtain quality experience in the enterprise. The PI's students are able to learn to carefully&nbsp; carry out tasks, perform experiments, make precise measurements, and eventually act more and more independently, even to the level of experimental design in some instances. Therefore, the students involved in research under this proposal, by and large are not merely assisting in the achievement of the scientific goals of the project, but are broadening their skill set to have both general and specific applicability to the workforce: time management; mental discipline; attention to detail; follow-through; and of course knowledge of laboratory chemistry techniques, safety, and the scientific method. Undergraduate research involvement has played a role in the success of these students, since the research students were able to largely attain a high GPA, stay retained in a science major, and, especially, develop an aptitude for advanced independent study. During the NSF grant period, 20 research students have been graduated (12 female and 8 male) and among those graduates, 6 students advanced to PhD in chemical science program, 5 students are enrolled at MD program, 3 students are in MS program and 6 students are full-time employed. Additionally, the PI is a faculty advisor for Iona STEP (Science and Technology Entry Program) and CSTEP (Collegiate STEP) which are programs to encourage STEM careers for underrepresented students in grades 9-12 and Iona College, has regularly participated in students' workshop. The PI is also actively involved in outreach activities to the community through several high school partnership events: science outreach seminars for Salesian High School and an annual science symposium for the local high school community in order to inform and inspire future scientists by fostering young peoples' enthusiasm for science.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/11/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sunghee&nbsp;Lee</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1212967/1212967_10193660_1473629764216_PJMilianta-CURPostersontheHill2016--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1212967/1212967_10193660_1473629764216_PJMilianta-CURPostersontheHill2016--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"PJMilianta-CUR Posters on the Hill 2016\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1212967/1212967_10193660_1473629764216_PJMilianta-CURPostersontheHill2016--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"PJMilianta-CUR Posters on the Hill 2016\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Peter Milianta (Biochemistry, '2016) at Iona College has participated in the 20th Annual Posters on the Hill in Washington DC, which took place on April 19-20, 2016, as sponsored by the National Council on Undergraduate Research.
