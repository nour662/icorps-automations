The IWPR report will be disseminated widely through a broad range of networks and organizations, including relevant professional societies, foundations, academic institutions, policymakers interested in STEM, and gender related organizations.  It is envisaged that the work of IWPR will result in expedited progress in increasing the representation of women of color.  Additionally, this activity may also provide a foundation upon which alternative strategies for women from other special populations can be built.",
