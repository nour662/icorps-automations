 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The purpose of this project is to award up to 20 scholarships each year for 4 years to recruit, retain, and graduate academically talented and financially needy undergraduate students majoring in Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Mathematics. The objectives of the S-STEM project are to (a) increase enrollment in the targeted STEM fields from underrepresented groups (women, ethnic minorities and first-generation students); (b) increase retention to degree achievement by providing improved educational opportunities in the targeted STEM fields so that the S-STEM scholars can achieve their best academic performance; (c) support these scholars through degree completion with a variety of structured institutional support programs, high quality enrichment activities, and partnering with potential employers to facilitate student career placement in the STEM workforce; and (d) prepare well-educated skilled STEM graduates and increase the number of STEM graduates who enter and remain in the workforce in a STEM-related professional job or enter graduate school in a STEM discipline. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The University is located in a region with a sizable low-income economically disadvantaged African-American inner-city population. The S-STEM leadership team is recruiting students from the local and regional high schools and from low-income families residing in both urban and rural areas, including the distressed counties as designated by the Appalachian Regional Commission. \r\n\r\nThe specific support services that are available for these S-STEM scholars to ensure that they excel academically are: an S-STEM scholar orientation program, peer tutoring, faculty mentoring, professional development, and S-STEM living and learning community (which provides an opportunity for S-STEM scholars to live together). S-STEM scholars also have the opportunity to acquire valuable research skills by taking part in faculty-mentored research projects in their respective STEM disciplines, leading to presentations at professional conferences.",

The 4-year graduation rate for these 19 S-STEM students was 100%, which is almost double that of the institution's 4-year graduation rate of 54.4%.   Additionally, the third-year and the fourth-year retention rate of all these S-STEM students was also 100%, in both cohorts.  By comparison, the third-year and the fourth-year retention rate at this institution is 78.8% and 66.8%, respectively.   Therefore, the impact of this S-STEM grant has also been very significant in terms of the retention rate.\n\nOut of the 19 students who graduated, 7 were Physics majors, 4 were Chemistry majors, 3 were Computer Science majors, 3 were Computer Engineering majors, and 2 were Math majors.  11 S-STEM scholarship recipients were males (58%) and 8 were females (42%).  One of the 8 female students was African American.  Some of these students were first generation students.   95% of the S-STEM scholarship recipients were White and 5% were African American.\n\nThe four-year mean GPA of all the S-STEM scholarship recipients was 3.55, which is higher than the mean GPA of the STEM students at this institution.  The mean GPA of the S-STEM male students was 3.51 and the mean GPA of the S-STEM female students was 3.62.  After graduation, out of the 19 students, 8 students (42%) are pursuing graduate studies in a STEM field, and 11 students (58%) are employed in the STEM workforce. \n\nAll the S-STEM scholarship recipients participated in the Eureka Learning Community activities that are dedicated for the STEM students.  This STEM living and learning community was founded by the PI in Fall 2013 as an initiative from the S-STEM grant. The Eureka Learning Community, based upon the theme \"Explore and Discover\", strives to enrich the students' academic experience through a variety of STEM activities.  One of the S-STEM scholarship recipients (a Physics major) served as the Eureka Learning Community's Student Coordinator for all the S-STEM scholarship recipients.  Each year, several S-STEM students participated in the Eureka Learning Community's STEM outreach activities at the Kentucky Science Center.  Several of the S-STEM scholarship recipients served as peer tutors/mentors at the Student Success Center.\n\nAll the S-STEM students worked on a research project in a STEM field in a wide range of topics under the supervision of a faculty mentor in their respective majors.  Notably, the research work of three of the female S-STEM students was funded by a grant from the Clare Boothe Luce Foundation.   \n\nFrom 2015 to 2018, these S-STEM students presented 46 talks and posters at local, state, professional/scientific, and national conferences/meetings.   Their research results were presented at the (i) 31st Annual National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) in 2017, (ii)  Annual KAPT (Kentucky Association of Physics Teachers) Meeting in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, (iii) 103rd, 102nd, 101st and 100th Annual KAS (Kentucky Academy of Science) Meeting in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, (iv) American Physical Society (APS) National Mentoring Community Conference in 2016, (v) Mathematical Association of America (MAA) MathFest Meeting in 2017, (vi) Kentucky-Section Mathematical Association of America (MAA) Meeting in 2018, (vii) LSST's (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Meeting in 2017, (viii) Annual Kentucky-Area Astronomical Society Meeting in 2016 and 2018, and (ix) Annual Bellarmine University Student Research and Creativity Poster Session in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.
