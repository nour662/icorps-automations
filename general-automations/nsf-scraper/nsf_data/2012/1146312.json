 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mutualisms - associations between different species in which both benefit - are profoundly important in nature. To date, however, our understanding of mutualisms has suffered from a lack of appropriate geographical and ecological context, a context that must be considered to fully understand how and why mutualisms exist.  \r\n\r\nThis project investigates a mutualism that underlies much of our food production and that is fundamental to life on earth: the interaction between flowering plants and their insect pollinators. It focuses on the Sonoran Desert rock fig and its pollinator, a species of fig wasp.  This pollination mutualism will be studied in many different places, some of which have parasites of the wasps and some that do not.  Theory predicts that where fig population size is small, as is typically the case with rock figs, reliance on a single species of short-lived pollinator leads to a high risk of pollinator extinction and eventual collapse of the mutualism.  This project will test whether figs flowering at different times reduce this risk.  Further, it will explore whether any such changes in the timing of flowering carry unexpected costs to the fig plants.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this study go beyond the fig-fig wasp system to include insights into how environmental factors influence where and when mutualisms occur. Further, the results will aid in understanding how climate change may affect pollination in small populations of plants that have specialized pollinators.  Educational impacts include undergraduate education and training via the development of two International Biology courses to engage undergraduates in field research and cultural experiences, and via opportunities for hands-on research experiences in a collaborative, laboratory environment.",

It focuses on the Sonoran Desert rock fig, <em>Ficus petiolaris</em>, and the species-specific fig wasp pollinator that develops within its fruit. We investigated this mutualism in the context of geographic variation in the environment and a diverse community of associated antagonists, including six non-pollinating fig wasp species, a moth caterpillar, and a nematode parasite, all of which develop at the cost of fig seeds or pollinator wasps.</p>\n<p>Theoretical studies have shown that where fig population size is small, as is typical of <em>F. petiolaris</em>, reliance on species-specific, short-lived pollinators leads to a high risk of local pollinator extinction and mutualism failure. We have shown previously that where fig populations are small, mutualism may be stabilized by adaptive changes in flowering. The results of this project reveal, however, that these reproductive adjustments by the plant incur significant costs by also benefiting the non-pollinating fig wasp parasites that, like the pollinator develop within fig fruit and, in doing so, negatively impact fig seed and pollinator production. By conducting this research over a broad geographic range and over multiple seasons, we show that these interactions of mutualists-antagonists-parasites vary substantially in both space and time, resulting in dynamics that could not have been understood from a short-term study at a single study site. Despite these complex dynamics, through theoretical and field studies we show that the unusually high diversity of non-pollinating wasp parasites on an individual fig species is associated with a trade-off between dispersal and competitive ability: those wasp species that are good dispersers are poor competitors, and vice versa. Coupled with the unpredictability in fruit production that characterizes figs, this trade-off supports the coexistence of multiple wasp parasite species on the same host. We also find that these parasitic fig wasps have the upper hand where the population density of fruiting fig trees is lower, whereas the pollinating fig wasp is more successful where fruiting densities are higher. Unexpectedly, we find that summer temperatures exceeding 40?C have greater negative impacts on the local abundance of parasitic as opposed to pollinating fig wasps, presumably because the non-pollinators spend more of their adult lives searching for receptive figs during which time they exposed to temperature extremes.</p>\n<p>Unpredictability of fig fruit production in space and time also poses challenges to the moth caterpillar that consumes <em>F. petiolaris</em> fruit, including the seeds and developing fig wasps they contain. We show that their abundance varies across the landscape and through time, and that their impact on fruit/seed/wasp production is associated with the production of larger and more synchronous fruit crops. While the caterpillars typically consume 0-15% of figs on most trees, in some cases the destroy entire fruit crops. As with the fig wasps, these dynamics that could not have been understood from the study of a single study site.</p>\n<p>An additional antagonist in the <em>F. petiolaris</em> system is a nematode parasite of the pollinating wasp. On other figs, related nematode species have been shown to reduce offspring production of pollinators by 10-20%. Examined across multiple geographic locations and seasons, impacts on the <em>F. petiolaris</em> pollinator only occasionally reached these levels. However, in the first longitudinal study of nematode effects on fig pollinator fitness, we found that high levels of nematode infection decreased pollinator longevity as well as their ability to disperse successfully to new fig fruits. Not previously reported in the literature, we found that the nematodes also parasitize all of the non-pollinating fig wasps associated with <em>F. petiolaris</em>, in several species substantially restricting their ability to successfully disperse to new fig fruits. By negatively impacting fig wasp parasites, these nematodes provide previously unappreciated benefits to the fig-pollinator wasp mutualism</p>\n<p>The implications of this research go beyond the fig-fig wasp system to include insights into how physical and ecological environmental factors interact to influence geographic dynamics in community-level species interactions. Further, our results aid in understanding how parasite effects may combine with climate change to influence the fitness of marginal populations and the limits of species range distributions.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/15/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;D&nbsp;Nason</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1146312/1146312_10175530_1518716923367_Fpettree--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1146312/1146312_10175530_1518716923367_Fpettree--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ficus petiolaris\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1146312/1146312_10175530_1518716923367_Fpettree--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ficus petiolaris\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A Sonoran Desert rock fig (Ficus petiolaris) growing in Baja California Sur, Mexico.
