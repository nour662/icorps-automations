 "awd_abstract_narration": "The shelf waters off the Western Antarctic Peninsula characteristically show high primary productivity, yet are bounded to the west and north by an  apparently iron limited Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Natural sources of bioavailable Fe amendments are thought variously to arise from atmospheric deposition, upwelled Circumpolar Deep Water shoaling over the continental shelf, glacier and iceberg melting or even inputs from underlying shallow shelf sediments.  As part of the ongoing Palmer LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) program,  a comprehensive study of the water column distribution, bio-uptake studies and the dynamics of various forms of Fe and other bioactive elements will be used to inform physical and biogeochemical  models of the WAP. \r\n\r\nThe Western Antarctic Peninsula is a region of recent rapid climate change and also an important time series site for monitoring carbon uptake  from the atmosphere, by the polar ocean. How ecological processes currently being studied in the context of the Palmer LTER site are adapting to a warming ocean is of interest to the science education community, the public, and society at large on issues ranging from the health of the oceans to global sea level rise.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:  \n\nThe Southern Ocean, despite being a major sink for carbon dioxide, is limited in biological productivity, in part because of limited supplies of the micronutrient Fe.  Shelf regions around Antarctica, however, appear to be natural Fe fertilization regimes, and are disproportionately important as contributors to the biological sink for carbon in the Southern Ocean.  Our study revealed for the first time the mechanisms by which Fe is delivered to the euphotic zone of the shelf region off the west side of the Antarctica Peninsula (WAP), a highly sensitive region with abundant life, that is severely impacted by ongoing climate change.  Ours is the first investigation to determine distributions of Fe in the shelf water column, despite the 25-year history of research on primary productivity in the Palmer Long Term Ecosystem Research (LTER) program to which our study was attached.  We expect the results to allow predictions of the future trends in Fe supply under the influence of ongoing climate change.  The results constitute a holistic and quantitative look at five additional bioactive metals (Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd) as well as the anthropogenic pollutant lead (Pb) in dissolved, colloidal and particulate forms, allowing interactions between metals and phytoplankton to be evaluated for a relatively large Southern Ocean shelf system, in the context of the full array of LTER supporting data.\n\nOur most important findings related to the role of Fe in structuring the phytoplankton assemblage on the WAP.  We found that large portions of the outer and middle shelf had very low surface water dissolved Fe concentrations, similar to those found in the offshore Southern Ocean, where primary producers are known to be Fe-limited.  The regions and extent of this low Fe varied interannually, comparing 5 years of January cruises.  The supply of Fe to the inner shelf euphotic zone seem to be associated with shallow sediment resuspension, lateral transport away from the coast, and injection into the sunlit surface by the action of wind mixing. In the middle and outer shelf, the supplies are linked to vertical mixing or upwelling of relatively Fe-rich subsurface waters resulting from interaction of the Upper Circumpolar Deepwater with Fe sources in shelf sediments, and deeper inner shelf waters were especially enriched by this process.  Sedimentary sources seem equally or more important than Fe sources associated with glacial meltwater input.  Sea ice melting was not seen to be an important source of Fe to the shelf region overall, as sea ice was largely melted or blown south by the wind at the time of the January cruises, and this Fe injection to surface waters seems to have been removed rapidly (within weeks).  The exception is the marginal ice zone when present in the most southerly region of the sampling grid.  Overall, we found strong gradients of bioavailable Fe from inner shelf to outer shelf regions, and evidence that the surface Fe distribution is modified by early season uptake by phytoplankton as well as by physio-chemical adsorption during the spring months preceding the January cruise.\n\nBroader Impacts: \n\nThis projected provided an opportunity for training the postdoctoral fellow Dr. Jessica Fitzsimmons who subsequently secured a tenure-track faculty position at Texas A&amp;M University.  Postdoc Amber Annett (hired October 2015) participated in her first LTER cruise, working with Fitzsimmons to complete sampling on the January 2016 expedition.  She has now secured a prestigious position as a NERC Independent Research Fellow at the University of Southampton, UK. We enhanced international science communication through collaborations with scientists in the UK and Holland. \n\nThis project investigated trace metal biogeochemistry as it relates to changes in primary production and the biological pump in shelf ecosystems of west Antarctica.  This region has been warming over the last three decades, at one of the highest rates globally, a likely product anthropogenic climate change.  The impact of warming, glacial melting, and ecosystem change on the trace element chemistry of this region is not well understood, and has begun to be investigated for the first time through this project.  The results are expected have relevance now and in the future for biogeochemical systems in other continental shelf regions, in Antarctica and beyond.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/12/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert M Sherrell"
