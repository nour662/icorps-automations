 "awd_abstract_narration": "Disasters create social disruption.  As a result, everyday lives change severely.  The amount of social disruption reflects the degree an event is a disaster.  One way to capture the amount of social disruption is through the use of cell phone data.  Normal, everyday cell phone use will be compared to disaster and post disaster use. As a result, it may be explained how much social disruption occurs from the disaster.  Also, the process and speed an area returns to \"normal (i.e., the pre-disaster patterns)\" may be seen.  Two recent, but different disasters (e.g., scope of area, speed of onset), will be selected for this study.\r\n\r\nThis project?s unique approach uses the expertise of a civil engineer, sociologist, and a computer scientist.  Math, computer science and travel behavior research will be combined to understand disasters.  This project will improve how we understand social disruption as a disaster.  It will also show how indirect measures can be used to study these events.  Also, it will lay the foundation for using other measures to capture the idea of \"social disruption.\" This project will also suggest that emergency managers can use these types of data to improve their emergency management capabilities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of the project is to develop measures at various scales to understand and quantify the evolution of a disaster (from pre-, to during- and post-disaster).  This concept is developed based on that during normal times, there is a certain rhythm of life in a society and when a disaster comes, the rhythm of life is disrupted and this disruption can be quantified through the use of multiple measures on human life and the infrastructure system that supports life.  Capturing and quantifying the changes in rhythms of life from pre- to during- and post-disaster will enhance our understanding of resilience, which is commonly defined as the capability to absorb disturbance, self-organize and adapt to external pressures such as climate changes.

The research carried out and the results advance the conceptual development in understanding and quantifying the evolution of a disaster and consequently viewing resilience as a process.  To achieve this, we proposed two conceptual frameworks: the Framework for Assessing Crisis in a System Environment (FACSE) and the Resilience Triangle (RT) framework. Our research also advances the methodological development in understanding and quantifying disasters and resilience by developing a range of metrics for rapid disaster impact assessment, tracking changes in infrastructure systems and social interactions following a disaster, and capturing multiple scales of information about resilience.  We show the rich, and complex relationships among the various components in resilience.  This information has not been revealed before, and will be critical to communities around the world as they prepare themselves and make strategic decisions about how to move toward resilient communities.\n\nBroader Impacts.
