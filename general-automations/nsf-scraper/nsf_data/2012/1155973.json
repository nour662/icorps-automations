Volodin on the Itelmen language in order to preserve this extensive data on this very endangered language, fewer than 20 fluent speakers, most over 70 years of age.  Volodin is the foremost Russian scholar of the Itelmen language, his archive holds over 12,000 slips (dictionary entries) from his Itelmen fieldwork.  Dr. Volodin is of advanced age and unfortunately is not computer literate; as a result his field data is itself endangered as no one can fully interpret his personal notes without the benefit of his knowledge. The project will digitize unique data on a highly endangered language for access by the linguistics community interested in comparative syntax and language shift.  In addition, it will add content to a FLEx database which will facilitate production of a print dictionary, allow online access for language scholars and allow integration with audio-visual materials gathered by others studying Itelmen.",

The work consisted in scanning images and manually entering the data of over 23,000 cards containing linguistic data.  These data were from the personal archives of retired Russian linguist Aleksandr P. Volodin.  Most of them were based on his own linguistic research in Kamchatka, the rest were written by anthropologists.  The aim was to preserve invaluable handwritten data while it was still possible to work with Professor Volodin and speakers of the language. \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nDocumentation Benefits of the project\n\nThere are now less than 10 fluent, confident speakers of the Itelmen language, all of advanced age. This NSF-sponsored project has helped, at a critical point in time, to preserve and digitize manuscript documentation that was neither published nor publicly archived.  The work consisted of scanning, entering and organizing data from the lexical card files of elderly linguist, Aleksandr P. Volodin while he was still able to assist in the process of interpreting the cards.  \nProfessor Volodin\u00c6s own card file consists of 12,281 cards with over 4,400 distinct words.  In addition, he had in his possession 11,618 cards with Itelmen-Russian and Russian-Itelmen translations, written by Nadezhda K. Starkova, an Itelmen ethnographer who conducted field research in the 1960s.  Volodin\u00c6s personal archive also includes 38 cards written by Soviet ethnographer E. P. Orlova, with about 40 words per card. All 23,937 cards were scanned and stored with file names corresponding to the Itelmen words.  \nUnder this project Professor Chikako Ono supervised  the manual entry of all of the data from the cards into a data base (FM Pro) and preparation for entry into the program Fieldworks Language Explorer (FLEx), from which a public archive and a published dictionary will be created.\nCapitalizing on the documentation while there are still remaining speakers of Itelmen has been important because we have been able to answer longstanding questions. In the process of scanning and data entry Professor Ono identified cards marked by Professor Volodin for checking in the field.  Through collaboration with another NSF project, \"Integrated Audio-Visual Documentation of Itelmen\" (BCS 1065619; IAVDI), the questions posed on these cards were brought before the few remaining Itelmen speakers in Kamchatka.  This critical cross-checking of unarchived data with competent Itelmen speakers would not have taken place without the intervention of this project.  \n\n\nBenefits of the eventual dictionary\n\nThe Itelmen language has traditionally been identified as a \"Paleo-Asiatic\" language, a designation that has no historical linguistic significance. Itelmen is widely considered to be related to the Koryak-Chukchi family of languages, but some linguists, including Professor Volodin, believe it may be an isolate. The data from this project and the comprehensive dictionary that will result can contribute to further research on the questions of origins and relatedness.\nThe digitization of the Volodin archive contributes to the larger project of creating a comprehensive dictionary of what may have been three Itelmen languages.  Professor Volodin\u00c6s cards bring together information that is otherwise scattered throughout sources ranging from 18th century Russian explorers to 19th century doctors to 20th century Russian and indigenous ethnographers. The combination of these sources in one work will make possible the better delineation of Itelmen language history. \n\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThis project also led to the submission of a grant proposal to complete a comprehensive Itelmen dictionary in a way that will complement the audio-visual d..."
