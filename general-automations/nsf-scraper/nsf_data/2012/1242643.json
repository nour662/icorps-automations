 "awd_abstract_narration": "This long-term project focuses on common loons, diving birds that breed on lakes in the northern U.S. and are famous for their loud, humanlike vocalizations. Both sexes defend territories from intruders, which often take them by force. About one-third of all male takeovers are fatal for the displaced breeder; females seldom fight to the death. Current theory predicts that lethal battles should be frequent in short lived animals because they have few reproductive opportunities, but organisms such as loons should never fight to the death because they are long-lived and territories are plentiful. Over the course of ten years, the project is testing three hypotheses to account for fatal fighting: 1) fatal battles constitute a 'terminal investment' for old, declining males, 2) males that fight to the death defend chicks well, which offsets their hyper-aggressiveness, and 3) extreme familiarity with a territory causes fatal battles. To test these hypotheses, the researchers follow and observe a large number of marked individuals, measure body mass of captured loons, and analyze territorial fights, usurpations and survival patterns across time. \r\n\r\nResults from this study will help scientists understand lethal contests in animals, aggressive behavior, and the process of aging. Though loons are common within their range, they are considered of special concern by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and are declining across their range. Long-term data and results from this project will inform conservation and management programs. In addition, the project will train a large number of undergraduate students who, by initiating independent field projects, will learn about experimental design, data collection and statistical analysis. Discoveries about this popular bird will be shared with the broader public via popular articles, T.V. and radio interviews, and a project website.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>NSF funding supported my investigation of fatal fighting in male common loons. Long-lived animals like loons should rarely engage in dangerous territorial battles, because serious injury or death would deprive them of a long life of breeding opportunities. Yet dangerous battles are routine among male loons. We tested three hypotheses for fatal fighting: 1) that male loons fight hard for their territories because they gain benefits from remaining on a familiar territory; 2) that high aggressiveness among males is not in itself beneficial but is linked to strong paternal care, which improves chick survival; and 3) that lethal contests in male serve as a form of terminal investment in territory defense -- an investment in breeding made by old individuals near death as a means of holding their territory for another year or two and eking out a few more offspring.</p>\n<p>Our findings clearly support the terminal investment hypothesis. First, our known-age population showed that males experience a sudden change in fortunes at age 15. Fifteen year-olds and older males suffer high mortality, lose their territories at a high rate, and show reduced body condition compared to their younger counterparts. (Females, which we compared to males, showed none of these age-related patterns.) Hence, males show clear senescence at age 15. Males also showed two clear behavioral changes at age 15. 15+ males give the male-only territorial yodel over twice as often as younger males, and older males also were significantly more aggressive than young males. In short, physical decline of males is paralleled by an abrupt increase in their territorial calling and their tendency to attack and chase territorial intruders. Though research on aggressive behavior and fatal fighting in male loons is ongoing, these data show a clear tendency for older males, which are in danger of losing their territories, to alter their behavior as a means to prolong territory ownership. This apparent terminal investment ranks among the few and best-documented cases of the phenomenon in nature.</p>\n<p>We made a variety of additional findings in the course of seeking to explain fatal fighting in male loons. These included a the negative impact of black flies (<em>Simulium annulus</em>) on loon nesting (Piper et al 2018); loons' tendency to improve the timing of territorial defense in years following chick production (Spool at al 2017); loon parents' extra defense of young chicks and two-chick broods (Jukkala and Piper 2015; the tendency for young nonbreeders to find and re-visit territories defended by vulnerable owners (Piper et al 2015); and a striking tendency for young loons to settle on breeding lakes that resemble their natal lakes in both size and pH (Piper et al 2013). Most noteworthy, however, is our very recent discovery that our study population is in decline, as shown by the decrease in number and mass of chicks, decrease in condition of breeding males, and reduction in the number of nonbreeders searching for breeding territories. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have sought to educate the public about our findings through website (loonproject.org) that features stunning photos and up-to-date information about loon ecology and behavior. The website has accumulated 115,019 hits among 56,652 visitors, since 2013, when I started it. The website explains our project goals and methods, the benefits of marking and studying loons, and threats to loon survival.
