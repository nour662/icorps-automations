Moreover, this research will integrate broad discoveries in nanotechnologies, nanofabrication, mechanics, process modeling, and instrumentation into a high rate, cost effective nanomanufacturing system. Meanwhile, the planned multidisciplinary research-based education program will link the research outcomes and students? activities to the needs of contemporary industry for nanotechnology, nanofabrication, and instrumentation. The research results will be broadly disseminated through technical publications, workshops, regular and short courses, and K-12 outreach program.",
