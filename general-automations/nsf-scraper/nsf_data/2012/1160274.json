 "awd_abstract_narration": "The world's linguistic diversity is diminishing at an alarming rate, and there are not enough resources (trained field linguists or funding for them) to document all the endangered languages before they are gone. Thus there is a critical need for software tools to support the efficiency of field linguists.  This project will develop software tools to assist in the documentation of endangered languages by merging two types of resources: Collections of linguistic examples curated by linguists and a cross-linguistic computational grammar resource, called the Grammar Matrix.  The result will be a system for creating machine-readable, or implemented, grammars from data collected and annotated by field linguists.\r\n\r\nImplemented grammars can contribute to endangered language documentation in several ways: The grammars themselves provide a very rich resource, allowing linguists to explore analyses at a level of precision not usually achieved in prose descriptions.  Furthermore, implemented grammars can be used to create treebanks, that is, collections of utterances associated with syntactic and semantic structures.  The process of creating the treebank can provide important feedback to the field linguist about aspects of the linguistic data not covered by current analyses.  The resulting treebanks can be used to create further computational tools and are also a rich source of comparable data for qualitative and quantitative work in linguistic typology, grounding higher-level linguistic abstractions in actual utterances in a computationally tractable fashion.\r\n\r\nWhile building an implemented grammar is typically not within the scope of a field linguistics project, field linguists do routinely create collections of examples of glossed, translated text (called \"IGT\"), which encapsulate the result of extensive linguistic analysis. This project will further develop computational methods for extracting typological information from IGT like those pioneered by the RiPLes project (Xia & Lewis 2007, Lewis & Xia 2008) and combine that information with the cross-linguistic resource produced by the Grammar Matrix project (Bender et al 2002, 2010) to create implemented grammars for endangered languages.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Information & Intelligent Systems of the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering is funding this award as part of its commitment to support the development of computational tools and methods for the documentation of endangered languages.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe goal of the AGGREGATION project is to support language\ndocumentation efforts by automatically creating computational grammars\nof endangered languages.  Computational grammars themselves form a\nrich, detailed type of documentation while also facilitating further\nlanguage description through automatically identifying sentences of\ninterest in the collected data.  The development of computational\ngrammars by hand is time-consuming, however, and so we seek to provide\nthese benefits through automatic grammar creation on the basis of\nanalyses already performed by field linguists. In particular, we are\nbuilding on a cross-linguistic computational grammar resource called\nthe LinGO Grammar Matrix customization system.  This system includes a\ncross-linguistic core grammar, meant to be useful for any language,\nand a series of `libraries' of analyses of cross-linguistically\nvariable phenomena.  Users of the system can access the libraries by\nfilling out a web-based questionnaire on the basis of which the system\nproduces a customized grammar.\n\nIn Phase I, the AGGREGATION project has developed prototype software\nto answer the LinGO Grammar Matrix's questionnaire directly on the\nbasis of endangered language data collected and annotated by field\nlinguists.  These annotations include both a translation into English\nand a `gloss' line that indicates the meaning or grammatical function\nof each word (or meaningful part of a word).  Our prototype system was\ntested on an annotated collection of data from Chintang, an endangered\nlanguage of Nepal.  It is able to create a grammar that can be used to\nanalyze a portion of the sentences in that corpus, relating the\nsentences to representations of their semantics.\n\nThe development of this prototype system required the development of\nseveral component pieces, including: (i) Xigt: A data model and XML\nserialization for storing annotated data in a way that is both\nefficient to work with computationally and flexible enough that we can\nadd enrichments to the annotations (such as grammatical analyses of\nthe English translations; (ii) Algorithms for inferring linguistic\nproperties of a language from annotated data such as what type of case\nmarking system they have (if any) or how they order the major\nconstituents of a sentence (subject, object and verb); (iii)\nAlgorithms for inferring the internal structure of words in a language\non the basis of annotated data; (iv) Methodologies for evaluating the\nsuccess of these algorithms.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/16/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Emily M Bender"
