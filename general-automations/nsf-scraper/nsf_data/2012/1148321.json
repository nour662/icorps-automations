 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geophysical Investigation of the Mid-Continent Rift System \r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the Central U.S. is an ideal place to study one of the more important processes shaping our planet - the breaking apart of continents to form new oceans. Throughout earth's history, continents have split along rifts, long zones of volcanism and stretching, which become spreading centers along which new ocean basins form and can grow to the size of the Atlantic and Pacific. It even looks like similar rifting may have happened on other planets.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how rifting works is important for both science and society, because rifting provides conditions for the deposition of hydrocarbons and other mineral resources. The problem is that when rifting succeeds in forming a new ocean, not much remains from its early stages so it's hard to see what happened.\r\n\r\nTo get around this, researchers are studying a spectacular rift that failed, the Mid-Continent Rift System.  This system evolved around 1.1 billion years ago, when North America nearly split.  However, the rift failed, leaving a 2000 km long belt of volcanic and sedimentary rocks left from the early rifting stage.  This fossil rift, which is similar in length to the present East African and Baikal rifts, has two major arms meeting in the Lake Superior region. One extends southwestward at least as far as Kansas, and the other extends southeastward through Michigan. These arms are identified using the large gravity and magnetic anomalies resulting from dense and highly magnetic igneous rocks. They are largely covered by younger sediments but outcrop near Lake Superior and can be followed further south in drill cores. \r\n\r\nThe study combines seismic and magnetotelluric data being acquired by NSF's EarthScope program with gravity and magnetic data to develop an integrated three-dimensional image of the rift system and constrain its evolution. One of its goals is to learn whether the rift formed as a response to melting in the underlying mantle, as commonly proposed for the East African Rift, or because of stresses transmitted within the lithosphere, as appears to be the case for Asia's Baikal Rift.",

When we teach about earthquakes, we tend to focus on the San Andreas Fault and others that make up the boundary between the North American and Pacific plates, or major thrust faults along subduction zones in Japan or Sumatra. And when we teach about volcanoes, we use Mount St. Helens, Yellowstone, Kilauea and other currently active systems as examples. While it is vital to teach about, and learn from active geologic processes, we should not overlook what is one of the most extraordinary examples of plate tectonic processes in the world right beneath our Midwestern feet. The 2000+ km long Midcontinent Rift System (MRS) was the site of one of the largest volume of volcanic eruptions in Earth history and includes major faults that were capable of earthquakes of M7 or larger. It represents a great teaching opportunity for Midwestern educators who have the right tools.</p>\n<p>This project was designed to provide those tools to educators in the Midwest by improving their understanding of the MRS and helping them design activities for teaching about it. The&nbsp;primary activity of this project was weeklong workshop from 10-15&nbsp;August 2014 at Michigan Tech in Houghton. This workshop was attended by both formal educators (e.g., middle school and high school Earth science teachers) and informal educators (e.g., education specialists from national, state, and local, and parks and museums). Through field trips and active data collection and interpretation, these educators learned about the geological and geophysical tools that have revealed the history of the MRS. The educators then worked to design teaching tools that could be used to help them and others.</p>\n<p>In addition to the workshop, an educational video (<span>https://youtu.be/w4kkKx-Wcoo</span>) and written guide to the MRS were created to help promote understanding and reach a wider audience.</p>\n<p>This project was part of a collaborative program that included new data collection and processing to advance the scientific understanding of the MRS and was focused on Broader Impacts of the collaborative program. By promoting teaching, training, and learning about active tectonic processes to formal and informal educators who then disseminate this knowledge to students and members of the general public, the project had a multiplier effect to amplify the impact of a small group of workshop facilitators.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gregory&nbsp;P&nbsp;Waite</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1148321/1148321_10218256_1514397659138_MRSEPgroupPhoto--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1148321/1148321_10218256_1514397659138_MRSEPgroupPhoto--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Workshop participants gather around Michigan Tech's bolder garden\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1148321/1148321_10218256_1514397659138_MRSEPgroupPhoto--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop participants gather around Michigan Tech's bolder garden\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A group of workshop participants gather around Michigan Tech's bolder garden.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shelley Olds</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gregory&nbsp;P&nbsp;Waite</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Workshop participants gather around Michigan Tech's bolder garden</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1148321/1148321_10218256_1514395339455_SledgeHammermakingwaves2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1148321/1148321_10218256_1514395339455_SledgeHammermakingwaves2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Collecting refraction data\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1148321/1148321_10218256_1514395339455_SledgeHammermakingwaves2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Collecting refraction data\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Workshop participants collect refraction seismic data using a sledgehammer source.
