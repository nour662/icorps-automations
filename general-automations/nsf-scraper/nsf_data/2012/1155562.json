 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic carbon (Corg) remineralization rates are typically highest near the sediment-water interface, and decrease with depth as labile substrates and strong oxidants are consumed. However, in many ocean margin sediments, at the depth interval where sulfate (SO4=) is exhausted and CH4 concentrations begin to increase (the sulfate-methane transition; SMT), SO4= reduction rates typically show strong sub-surface maxima, indicating locally-enhanced microbial activity and carbon turnover. These hot spots for SO4= reduction are generally attributed to anaerobic oxidation of CH4 by SO4=, but a number of studies have found an excess of SO4= reduction over CH4 oxidation, indicating the presence of a major additional SO4= sink in the SMT. \r\n\r\nIn this project a research team from San Francisco State University, Florida State University, and Old Dominion University will investigate the nature of this SO4= sink by combining cutting-edge porewater compositional analyses -- del-14C and del-13C of CH4, dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC), and 1H-NMR on DOC -- with numerical reactive transport modeling.  They will test the hypothesis that the SMT is an oxidation front for not just CH4, but also for DOC that is produced deeper in the sediment column, and transported upward into the SMT.  They will also test the idea that not all of this DOC is oxidized in the SMT, and that some reaches the surface sediments, and represents a source of 14C-depleted (pre-aged) DOC to the oceans. The premise is that DOC production from Corg is enhanced in methanogenic sediments due to an uncoupling in the anaerobic food chain between terminal metabolism and fermentation reactions involved in the overall Corg remineralization process. The work will focus on two ocean margin sites, Santa Monica Basin and Santa Barbara Basin, which despite their geographic proximity, appear to have different CH4 dynamics in the deep sediments. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This study should result in a greater understanding of the role of sub-surface sediments in the overall benthic Corg remineralization process, and in the exchange of major elements between the sea floor and the water column. It will also allow testing of the hypothesis that marine sediments are sources of 14C-depleted, recalcitrant DOC to the overlying water column, thereby addressing a problem that has perplexed chemical oceanography for several decades: what factors control the 14C signature of DOC in the deep oceans? \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This work will integrate research and education in several ways. It will allow the 3 PIs to continue with their effort to incorporate their research activities into the classes they teach, which range from advanced graduate- to 100-level undergraduate courses intended for non-science majors. Second, it will directly impact the learning experiences of 2 Ph.D. and 2 M.S. candidates, and at least 2 undergraduate students who will receive training in key aspects of the proposed work, including the field, experimental and modeling components.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur overall goal was to better characterize carbon transformation processes occurring in the deep sub-surface of continental margin sediments, and to evaluate their significance in material exchange between sediments and the water column.  Specifically, we have identified the major sinks for sulfate in the transition zone between the sedimentary regions of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis (the SMTZ), and we have also evaluated the fate of pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that is produced in sub-surface sediments. We focus on pore water DOC because it is the key intermediate pool in organic matter degradation processes such as sulfate reduction and methanogenesis.  We carried out our studies in the anoxic sediments of Santa Barbara Basin and Santa Monica Basin, both of which are part of the California Borderland region.\n\nOur results have verified many aspects of a model for DOC cycling in anoxic sediments that we recently proposed.  Specifically, we see that most particulate organic matter is rapidly degraded (through reactive DOC intermediates) to inorganic end-products (e.g., DIC), with only a small amount of net production of refractory DOC.  Our results similarly support the suggestion that the initial stages of particulate organic matter degradation (i.e., hydrolysis or oxidative cleavage of this material) represent the rate-limiting portion of the overall sediment organic matter degradation process.  We have also observed that DOC produced in the deeper methanogenic sediments of Santa Barbara Basin sediments is not responsible for the observed imbalance between sulfate and DIC fluxes into the SMTZ of these sediments.  Note that in Santa Barbara Basin sediments the SMTZ occurs at a sediment depth of ~125 (&plusmn;20) cm.\n\nMost refractory DOC produced in Santa Barbara and Santa Monica Basin sediments escapes the sediments as a benthic flux.  There is also deep source of refractory DOC to Santa Barbara Basin sediments that is essentially radiocarbon-\"dead\" (note that here \"deep\" represents sediment depths &gt; 4.6 m, our maximum depth of sediment sampling).  However, the upward flux of this material is small when compared to in situ production higher up in the sediment column of other forms of refractory DOC with more modern radiocarbon signatures.  The lifetime of refractory pore water DOC in Santa Barbara Basin sediments is comparable to that estimated for refractory DOC in the marine water column.  This supports arguments made elsewhere that sediment benthic fluxes may represent an important source of refractory DOC to the oceans.  This benthic flux may contribute refractory and pre-aged DOC to the water column, depending on any differences in the reactivity of the different sub-components of the refractory pore water DOC pool in anoxic sediments versus the oxic marine water column.\n\nAnaerobic oxidation of methane is an important sink for sulfate in the SMTZ, and our results have shown the importance of active methanogenesis and upward fluxes of methane from deeper sources in controlling carbon dynamics in the SMTZ.   These deep methane sources may include relict gas hydrates or ancient gas deposits.  Furthermore, our results suggest that such deep methane sources are not unique to Santa Barbara Basin sediments but may be a common occurrence in many continental margin sediment settings.  These results further indicate the effectiveness in general of the SMTZ as a barrier for the escape of this deep methane from continental margin sediments into the water column and perhaps into the atmosphere.  Because methane is an important greenhouse gas, understanding these dynamics are important for addressing questions about how changes in sediment methane cycling may have affected global temperatures in the geologic past, as well as how rising bottom water temperatures and deoxygenation, two likely outcomes of anthropogenic global warming, will impact the effectiveness of this barrier in the future.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modi..."
