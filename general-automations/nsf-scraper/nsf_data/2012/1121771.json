 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit\r\nThe yeast centrosome, also called the spindle pole body, organizes microtubules required for a variety of cellular processes that include cell division.  During meiosis, the centrosome is duplicated when chromosomes replicate.  Duplicated centrosomes separate to form a bipolar spindle required for homolog separation during the first division of meiosis.  Centrosomes duplicate again in the absence of chromosome replication to establish two spindles for sister chromatid separation in the second meiotic division.  Coordination of centrosome duplication and separation with the two chromosome segregation cycles in meiosis is fundamental to maintain genome integrity in eukaryotes.  The goal of this project is to determine the molecular mechanism by which the Aurora kinase Ipl1 and the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 act antagonistically to regulate centrosome duplication and separation.  Using creative yeast genetics in combination with live-cell microscopy and biochemical methods, the temporal and spatial requirements of Ipl1 and Cdc5 in centrosome duplication will be determined.  In addition, their phosphorylated substrates will be identified by a novel phosphoproteome approach and characterized for their biochemical activities in regulation of centrosome dynamics.  These studies will provide a mechanistic view of protein phosphorylation mediated by Ipl1 and Cdc5 in yeast centrosome duplication and have general implications for understanding the mechanism of centrosome dynamics in animals.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\nThis project will train graduate and undergraduate students in genetics and cell biology, and will also provide unique opportunities for underrepresented and minority students to design and conduct goal-oriented experiments in their classroom.  Students enrolled in the Experimental Biology course, which the PI teaches once a year, will tag centrosome components with the green fluorescent protein and screen for genetic abnormalities of the centrosome in yeast.  This research will provide molecular insights into the regulation of centrosome duplication and contribute to society by educating those who will be part of our future work force as scholars and scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCentrosomes nucleate microtubules during cell division.  Timely separation of duplicated centrosomes is necessary for the formation of a bipolar spindle and therefore proper chromosome segregation, but the molecular mechanism of how centrosomes separate remains unclear.  Yeast centrosomes separate within minutes after duplication in mitosis; in contrast, they are tethered for hours at the meiotic G2 phase by a nuclear envelope attached structure called the half-bridge.  The objective of this project is to use the centrosome cycle in yeast meiosis as a model to determine how centrosome separation is regulated.  We have identified key factors including Ndj1 and Mps3 that localize to the half-bridge and characterized their roles in regulating centrosome separation.  Using combined approaches of protein affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we have identified 247 phosphorylation sites at the yeast centrosome, and revealed that protein phosphorylation at the half-bridge is required for centrosome separation in yeast.  Because three out of the four half-bridge components are conserved from yeast to human, our findings provide a framework for studying the mechanism of centrosome disjunction in animal cells.\n\nThis project involved training of one postdoctoral scholar, two graduate, eight undergraduate, and four high school students in the PI's laboratory.  The postdoctoral scholar has now established her own lab, and one former undergraduate student is currently in medical school; two are in graduate school.  Yeast strains and other materials generated from this project have been used in the Experimental Biology&mdash;Yeast Genetics (BSC3402L) course that the PI teaches annually at the Florida State University, providing ~25 students each year with experience in conducting goal-oriented research.  This project therefore not only provides insight into how centrosome separation is regulated, but also contributes to the education of our future workforce.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/03/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hong-Guo Yu"
