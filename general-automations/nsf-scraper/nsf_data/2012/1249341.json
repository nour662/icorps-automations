 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will provide the first continental-scale sample of taxonomic, genetic and\r\nfunctional diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi from pine ecosystems. These fungi form symbiotic relationships with the roots of dominant forest plants, and provide them with nutrients and water in exchange for photosynthetically-fixed carbon. Despite the importance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in global nutrient cycles, little is known about large-scale patterns of fungal community structure relative to plants, animals, or even bacteria. This project will establish patterns of gene flow and selection for multiple ectomycorrhizal fungi across North America, use a hierarchical phylogenetic sampling design to measure variation in functional enzyme production across individuals, populations and species, and use RNA based metagenomics to measure functional trait expression on mycorrhizal root tips. \r\n\r\nThe project will result in a large, open access database of taxonomic barcode and functional genes that can be used by researchers to generate predictive models of fungal ecosystems. It will include training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in cutting-edge techniques in an understudied field, will result in outreach activities targeted toward the general public, and will include activities for K-12 students and educators designed to foster early student interests in fungi.\r\n",

Despite this, there are critical gaps in our knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary processes that structure the phylogenetic, functional, and genetic diversity of most microbial communities. In this project we addressed these knowledge gaps by investigating the dimensions of biodiversity for a keystone plant-fungal mutualism &ndash; ectomycorrhizal symbiosis &ndash; that is widespread and strongly influences plant health and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Through this project we completed the first continental scale analysis of soil fungal communities across North America, collecting over 1000 soil samples across 71 plots spanning a geographic range from Florida to Alaska. As part of this effort we helped develop high throughput DNA sequencing approaches to better characterize fungal diversity and transcriptomic techniques to characterize fungal activity. Our results show that these soil fungal communities were heavily dominated by ectomycorrhizal mutualists and exhibited very distinct regional assemblages. Our analyses suggest that these geographic patterns are driven by both climate and dispersal limitation, and have helped to overturn the pervious view of microbial communities that &ldquo;everything is everywhere, but the environment selects&rdquo;. A population genomic study carried out for this project also supports these conclusions, show evidence of local adaptation and limited gene flow between spatially separated populations. These results suggest that global phylogenetic and genetic diversity of soil fungi may be much higher than previously suspected. In addition, we also showed that the enzymatic activity in soil fungal communities is highly convergent across different regions of North America, suggesting high degrees of functional redundancy.
