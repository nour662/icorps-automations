In addition the project provides prospective teachers with a practicum experience with experienced  teaching assistants who have been trained in mentoring preservice teachers and in planning and facilitating classroom practices.  It is also developing, implementing, and carrying out research on a professional development program for teaching assistants who instruct precalculus.  These teaching assistants are being trained in facilitating inquiry-based student-centered teaching strategies.",
