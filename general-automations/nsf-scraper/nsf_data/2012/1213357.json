 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical, Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism program supports work by Professor Gerald Meyer at Johns Hopkins University to carry out fundamental studies on the mechanisms of photo-initiated bond-breaking and bond-forming reactions at molecular-semiconductor interfaces relevant to solar fuels generation.  Proposed studies will specifically focus on quantification of the electron transfer behavior of molecules at semiconductor interfaces and correlation of this behavior with charge transfer kinetics relevant to the formation of metal-ligand and carbon-carbon bonds.  The proposed studies are fundamental in nature, but are directly relevant to the development of efficient photocatalytic materials.  The molecules and materials proposed will enable one to address long-standing fundamental interfacial science questions relevant to solar energy conversion in molecular detail that was not possible even twenty years ago.   \r\n\r\nThrough participation in this fundamental research, students at the undergraduate and graduate level will receive intensive training in characterization of the kinetics and thermodynamics of molecular-semiconductor interfaces.  This proposal will train students in interdisciplinary areas with particular focus on molecular coordination chemistry, catalysis, photochemistry, and photoelectrochemistry.  Results from these studies are envisioned to one day enable the rational molecular-level design of integrated materials capable of harvesting sunlight, vectorial charge separation, and multi-electron transfer catalysis to form useful fuels.",
