 "awd_abstract_narration": "Charm physics is an important component of the field of flavor physics. This field is currently in a renaissance with significant results coming from measurements at a number of experimental facilities worldwide, including B-factories, Hadron Colliders, and Charm factories.  An important objective in flavor physics is the determination of all of the elements of the Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa (CKM) mixing matrix, which is a matrix of complex numbers that relates the electroweak interactions of the six known flavors (or types) of quarks.  The Wayne State University group has made significant contributions to the study of the mixing of neutral charm D mesons at CLEO-c.   Notable among their measurements is the extraction of an important parameter known as the strong phase in decays of neutral D mesons into final states containing charged Kaons and Pions.   This measurement has impact on the determination of one of the CKM mixing angles called gamma.  The group plans to continue the study of D decays with BELLE-II at KEK in Japan and is exploring a new test of CP violation in D decays. Additionally at BELLE-II, the group intends to study rare decays of D mesons, looking for 4 quark content, and building upon earlier expertise gained at CLEO-c. The broader impacts efforts of the group are considerable through REU/RET programs, reaching students from underrepresented groups who participate directly in the research program.",
