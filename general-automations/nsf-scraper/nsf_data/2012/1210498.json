 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hybridization of genetically distinct groups is an important, natural occurrence in many plants that can generate new species and transfer beneficial traits from one group to another. Genetic information, such as which and how many genes affect hybridization, is lacking for most plants, including many ecologically and economically important species. This research will use state-of-the-art DNA sequencing methods to examine the natural hybridization of two ecotypes (genetically distinct varieties adapted to different habitats) of switchgrass, a perennial tallgrass native to North America. These DNA sequencing methods generate hundreds of times more data than previously possible, thus enabling analyses across the entire genome of switchgrass rather than just a handful of genes. The data will be used to identify hybrid populations, analyze patterns of migration, and identify regions in the switchgrass genome that are being transferred between ecotypes or that decrease the success of hybrids. \r\nSwitchgrass is an emerging bioenergy crop and one of the most widely used species for land conservation. The patterns of genetic variation and hybridization identified in this project will have direct implications on selecting appropriate varieties of switchgrass for bioenergy production and conservation needs. Additionally, the characterized hybrid populations will be valuable resources for future work identifying genes that affect economically important bioenergy traits. Beyond the bioenergy and conservation implications, this proposal will act as a template for implementing new genotyping methods in other ecologically and/or economically important species that, like switchgrass, do not have the research resources of traditional model organisms.",
