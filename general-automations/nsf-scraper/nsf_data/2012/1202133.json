The research approach is: (1) Joint estimation of battery's State of Charge, State of Health, and model parameters; (2) adaptive battery management with optimal battery charging and cell balancing control; (3) integration and management of used electric vehicle batteries for grid energy storage via State of Charge weighted power control. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merits:  (1) Fast, robust and accurate battery characterization via real-time and joint estimation for achieving adaptive and optimal battery management. (2) Facilitating the second use of retired electric vehicle batteries. (3) Versatile and transformative technologies for different types of batteries and model structures, and for new or old batteries. (4) Complementary educational tools and programs to enhance the educational effort in vehicle electrification and sustainable energy development.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:  The success of this project will help achieve cleaner and more efficient transportation, along with more reliable power grids capable of integrating higher quantities of electricity from intermittent renewable sources. All these will eventually lead to a more secure and sustainable energy development in the U.S.A. This project will have significant educational, societal, and economical impacts by advancing technology and workforce development for the industry of electric-drive vehicle, battery, renewable energy and smart grid, which are all the critical areas for the nation's security and future development.",

Technical Outcomes: (i) Real-time joint battery characterization and state of charge (SOC) estimation. An innovative battery characterization method has been developed to simultaneously estimate battery SOC and other important battery parameters and effectively addressed the challenges introduced by flat terminal voltage curves in estimation while achieving fast convergence rates and robustness to measurement noises. Five journal papers have been published for this outcome. (ii) Balanced control of networked large battery systems that consist of heterogeneous battery cells/modules. Instead of carrying out cell balancing after charging or discharging (i.e. during idle time), the developed balanced charging and discharging scheme continuously control individual cells/modules in the battery system to keep them balanced during operation. This new method solves the problem in integrating heterogeneous battery packs of different types, ages, and capacities by first characterizing the battery packs. This is of critical importance in implementing large grid scale battery storage systems using retired electric vehicle batteries. The method is more efficient in that balancing during normal operation is achieved by tuning rates differently from one battery pack to another instead of dumping energy, or shuffling energy among battery packs. This outcome has been reported in an IEEE journal paper and will be potentially commercialized through a patent application. The provisional patent application of this outcome has been filed and approved (Publication #: WO2016009389 A1). (iii) Modular, reliable and efficient power converters for uniform SOC management of large scale battery systems.&nbsp; A prototype of 3-phase 33-level hierarchal cascaded multilevel converter has been developed. The converter prototype has successfully verified the uniform SOC management of cells/modules in a large battery storage system by controlling the charge and discharge of each cell/module during operation. The converter has the features of high voltage and high power application capability and modular design for cost reduction and reliability improvement.&nbsp; Continuous uniform SOC operation can be achieved via the proposed converter without adding additional balancing circuits. Two conference papers have been presented and a journal paper is under development for this outcome. A provisional patent application on this new converter is under process of being filed. (iv) A new reliability assessment method for large scale battery systems with power electronic converters. The new reliability evaluation method is especially capable of evaluating battery system with a large number cells based on the state-of-health (SOH) estimation of battery modules and cells. This outcome is a timely contribution to addressing the urgent need created by the exponential growth of battery energy storage systems in power systems. The reliability assessment includes power electronic converters and other necessary components in a large battery storage system and provides reliability evaluations for different operation conditions and system topologies.&nbsp; This outcome is evidenced by an IEEE transaction paper, numerous seminars and an IEEE conference panel. &nbsp;(v) New approaches for battery packaging and for development and implementation of battery energy storage systems for microgrids and power systems. The developed automatic battery characterization method has been used for battery cell grouping and battery module packaging to increase the manufacturing efficiency and battery pack quality. New unit sizing methods and energy management systems have been for microgrids with battery energy storage systems. Three journal papers have been published for this work of this outcome. One paper won the 2015 Highly Cited Paper Award &ndash; Applied Energy.</p>\n<p>2. Educational Outcomes: (i) Curriculum development. A special topic course has been developed with one section on battery storage system and battery management. The developed course materials on battery characterization and control of batteries have complemented and been cross-embedded with the Electrical Engineering and Electric Vehicle Engineering programs at the university to enhance the educational effort in vehicle electrification and sustainable energy development. (ii) Lab development. A battery testing bench has been developed in the lab for demonstration. Power electronic converter components have been added to the lab for managing batteries and interfacing alternative energy sources.</p>\n<p>3. Outreach Outcomes and Broader Impacts. Two workshops on &ldquo;New Energy Vehicles and Intelligent Transportation&rdquo;, one conference session (ITEC-E3) and two conference panels have been organized, and more than twenty seminars have been delivered, and numerous discussions with local community partners (such as Detroit Downtown Boxing Gym Youth Program and Wayne State University Sustainability Office and Detroit Edison) have been exchanged to increase the community outreach engagement of the project. &nbsp;Our research can help improve the adoption of more fuel-efficient and environmental-friendly electric-drive vehicles, re-utilize retired electric vehicle batteries for grid support, increase the capability of grid in accommodating more renewable energy sources to grid, and hence increase the overall level of sustainable development. This project will help advance workforce development in electric vehicles and renewable energy and hold a sustainable economy development for the region and the nation.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t
