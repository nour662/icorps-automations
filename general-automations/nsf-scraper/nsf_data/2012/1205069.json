Advances in data availability and processing software are enabling analysis and application of such observations by Remote Sensing Technicians, an occupational code approved by the U.S. Department of Labor in 2009.\r\n\r\nThe Integrated Geospatial Education and Technology Training: Remote Sensing (iGETT-RS) project represents a collaboration among the National Council for Geographic Education, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the U.S. Geological Survey Remote Sensing Program, the Environmental Systems Research Institute, and ITT Visual Information Solutions. The project is preparing 36 geospatial educators to develop integrated geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing courses, curricula and programs at 32 two-year colleges, two high schools and two universities. During summer institutes and the academic year, faculty are participating in a community of practice to learn remote-sensing science, integrate remote sensing and GIS, and develop teaching skills and programs across diverse STEM disciplines and at diverse institutions. Peer-tested teaching resources are being widely disseminated to other institutions through a project website, further broadening the impact of the project. Project outcomes include industry-relevant training to meet the growing national need for remote-sensing technicians, as well as workforce needs in other high-growth geospatial industries.",
