 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator's (PI's) team will calculate the injection and acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs) caused by shock wave events associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The proposing team will use a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic  model of CME shocks to trace the evolution of these shock waves in a realistic manner and to calculate the SEP source particle distribution in space. The team will obtain the temporal and spatial variation of SEP source intensity and spectra in the solar corona, and input this data into their three-dimensional interplanetary particle transport model for calculation of SEP intensity at Earth and other locations in the solar system.\r\n\r\nThe PI states that the results of this study will assist the development of improved space weather tools to forecast the near-Earth space radiation environment resulting from solar events. The PI also notes that particle injection and acceleration by shock waves is one of the great unsolved problems in space physics and astrophysics. This investigation of particle acceleration and transport in the solar system will enhance our understanding of many other high-energy astrophysics phenomena in the universe (such as cosmic rays, supernova remnants, and gamma-ray emissions). In addition, the project will provide training to a young postdoctoral scientist.",
