The site will support ten participants for ten weeks to carry out experimental and theoretical research projects in a broad range of areas in the IU Physics Department and the IU Center for Exploration of Energy and Matter (CEEM). Research topics in a wide range of projects will be available, including experimental and theoretical research in accelerator physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, elementary particle physics, materials physics, medical physics, and nuclear physics.  Special programs for the students include orientation sessions, weekly seminars on current research in physics, discussions on professional development and scientific ethics, and progress presentations. At the conclusion of the program, the students will present their results in talks at a closing symposium and develop a way to share their results to a technical audience. They will also be encouraged and supported to present their work at professional meetings in the following academic year.",
