 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this fundamental research is to explore a new accelerated testing (AT) methodology that improves the reliability estimation accuracy of an AT experiment while minimizing its total energy consumption. The basic idea of AT is to expose test units of a product to harsher-than-normal operating conditions to expedite failures. However, AT often consumes significant amounts of energy. To avoid the waste of energy in a wide spectrum of product development processes, this research will increase our knowledge by incorporating control theory into such complex experimental designs that require new tools to jointly handle statistical estimation accuracy, controller design, and energy assessment via computer simulation. The methodology will determine the interrelationship between various stress loadings and total energy use, establish a generic framework to facilitate the optimum experimental design and energy reduction process, and provide advanced control strategies capable of following various stress loadings. To validate the methodology, the long-term reliability of solder joints will be studied,   which is quite challenging in the microelectronics industry and is essential for millions of applications. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will change the current reliability testing practices in developing highly reliable products (or materials) that are continually faced with increasing needs for time- and energy-saving technologies. Considering millions of products being developed in the U.S. and the world, energy reduction in reliability testing for each stage of a development process will eventually lead to substantial energy savings. This research complements the world-wide sustainability efforts in actively seeking new energy resources. The research findings will also enhance education and knowledge dissemination in reliability engineering, equipment and control, statistics, and energy-saving technologies. Moreover, the results will be broadly disseminated through publications, workshops, and industry collaborations. Furthermore, minority and female students will be recruited in this project and K-12 teachers and students will be exposed to cutting edge research experiences.",
