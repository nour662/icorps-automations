  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA surface is a space that looks locally like the two-dimensional plane, something an exploring ant, looking left and right, back and forth, but not so much up and down, might experience. A loop on a surface is a closed path, something an ant would trace indefinitely by following its previous steps. A mapping class is a way of seeing the same surface differently, for example, by turning it around or twisting parts of it (although it is important that these changes do not need to take place in an ambient space).  In particular, a mapping class moves around the loops.  (See Figure 1, and notes on Figure 1 below.)  New mapping classes are obtained by reversing a mapping class or performing two in sequence, so that all the mapping classes for a given surface have the structure of a group, that is, an algebraic entity such as the collection of moves on a Rubik's cube, or invertible matrices with matrix multiplication, or most generally, the collection of symmetries of an object.\n\nMapping class groups of surfaces connect many areas of mathematics.  The most important kind of mapping classes, called pseudo-Anosov, meaningfully change all finite sets of loops.  Major theorems in low-dimensional topology have clarified how surfaces and mapping classes create the building blocks for three-dimensional spaces, and the richest and most expansive of these&mdash;the ones admitting hyperbolic geometry&mdash;are built with pseudo-Anosov mapping classes.  On the other hand, mapping class groups are themselves spaces admitting their own kind of geometry, and this geometry is in some ways similar to, and in other ways very different from, hyperbolic geometry.  Ideas for studying mapping class groups translate to many other related and interesting groups, and these tenets and tools form an important part of the area of mathematics called geometric group theory.\n\nThis project set out to contribute to our understanding of mapping class groups of surfaces.  The concrete outcomes of this project include four papers and one book chapter.  The paper [KM15] concerns how to algorithmically decide whether a mapping class is pseudo-Anosov.  The paper [CMP15] addresses the analogous question for the very related class of groups called outer automorphism groups of free groups.  The paper [MT] concerns subgroups of mapping class groups in which all elements are pseudo-Anosov.  The paper [KMT] introduces and motivates the analogous investigation for another important class of groups called right-angled Artin groups.  The chapter is for a broad-audience book on geometric group theory titled \"Office Hours with a Geometric Group Theorist,\" edited by Matt Clay and Dan Margalit, to be published by Princeton University Press.\n\nNotes on Figure 1:\n\nShown here are ants tracing loops on surfaces.  In the precise definition of a loop, we allow continuous perturbations, such as those created by an ant following its previous scent trail slightly imperfectly.  After such a perturbation the loop is considered unchanged; in mathematical terms, loops are only defined up to homotopy.\n\n(a) Ant on a sphere, such as the surface of an orange.   The sphere has no non-trivial loops: by making small, local deviations, an ant on any closed path may eventually be spinning in place; equivalently, closed paths on a sphere bound disks.  The mapping class group of the sphere is also trivial.\n\n(b) Ant on a torus, such as the surface of a bagel.  This is the surface of genus 1, and the closed loops correspond to the rational slopes for lines on the plane.  The mapping class group is the same as SL(2,Z).\n\n(c) Two ants tracing two loops on a surface of genus two, and the effect of a mapping class on those loops.  The mapping class group is much more complicated than SL(2,Z).\n\nBibliography:\n\n[KMT] The geometry of purely loxodromic subgroups of right-angled Artin groups, with Thomas Koberda and Samuel J.
