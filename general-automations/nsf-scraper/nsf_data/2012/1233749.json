In addition, data from the East Pacific Rise plume will document whether hydrothermal vent systems contribute to the oceanic Pb budget.   \r\n\r\nIn terms of the broader impacts, for outreach activities, the proponents plan to expand the Chemical Oceanography educational unit at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center of the University of California, Santa Cruz.  The project is a collaborative effort between scientists in the United States and Chile.  One graduate student from Massachusetts Institute of Technology would be supported and trained as part of this project.  Undergraduate students, especially under-represented Science, Technology Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students, would also have the opportunity to participate in this study as part of their thesis research.",
