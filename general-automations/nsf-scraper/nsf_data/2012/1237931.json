 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Nathan Springer (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities)\r\n\r\nCoPIs: Damon Lisch (University of California, Berkeley), Matt Vaughn (Texas Advanced Computing Center, University of Texas - Austin), and Irina Makarevitch (Hamline University)\r\n\r\nWhile it is clear that genetic changes play a major role in controlling phenotypic variation there is increasing evidence that epigenetic changes may also play an important role.  There is considerable excitement about the existence of epigenetic variation because it raises the possibility that a memory of environmental or genetic conditions can be encoded and propagated independent of changes in DNA sequence.  This possibility has obvious and important implications for both evolutionary biologists and plant breeders, but the relative role of epigenetic variation in conditioning phenotypic variation, particularly in crop species, remains poorly understood.  This project will develop an understanding of the prevalence, origin and effects of epialleles in maize, an agronomically important species that is likely to be rich in epigenetic variation.  This work will provide an extensive catalogue of epigenetic variation in maize and teosinte genotypes and will explore the extent to which processes such as generation of doubled haploids or silencing of transposons can contribute to that variation.  Several experiments will also probe the mechanisms that underlie the creation and maintenance of epigenetic variation.  Others will be aimed at determining the extent to which epigenetic variation can affect plant phenotypes.  Collectively, the experiments are designed to provide a comprehensive view of epigenetic regulation in a key crop species.  The genomic datasets developed in this project will be publicly available through a project website (accessible via http://www.cbs.umn.edu/labs/springer/) and at public repositories such as NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), Gramene (http://gramene.org), and MaizeGDB (www.maizegdb.org). Curated datasets and data analysis tools will also be publicly available at iPlant and biological materials will be available at public stock centers.\r\n\r\nThe research will provide a much more substantial understanding of the prevalence and effects of epigenetic variation in populations of maize.  It will also help in determining the extent to which that variation contributes to quantitative trait variation in this species, which may have a significant impact on selection of ideal genotypes (or epigenotypes) during plant breeding.  In a more general sense, this work will inform the current understanding of the role that epigenetic variation has played in maize domestication and the contribution of epigenetic change to evolutionary change in plants.  The project will also develop computational resources that would enable powerful epigenomic studies in maize by centralizing the data and interpretation of complex datasets.  Finally, this project will provide training and outreach opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students in a variety of settings.  Particular emphasis will be placed on including members of historically under-represented groups and on the incorporation of teacher training into research activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIt is critical to develop crop varieties that can produce sufficient amounts of food, fuel or fiber to supply a growing population.  These crops must be resilient to environmental conditions such as drought and productive with minimal inputs of fertilizer or pesticides.  Plant breeders and geneticists have important roles to play in understanding how the information in genomes can be used to produce improved crops.  This project has focused on developing additional knowledge about heritable information in crops.  Genetic variation describes the differences in genome sequence among individuals of the sample species.  Epigenetic variation refers to heritable variation that is not due to changes in DNA sequence.  We have studied the sources of epigenetic variation in maize.  One of the molecular mechanisms that can provide epigenetic information is DNA methylation.  Researchers working on this project have documented the genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in a large collection of maize plants including diverse inbred lines, mutant stocks and populations of plants that had been subjected to processes used in plant breeding and biotechnology.  The researchers used this information to understand the frequency of changes in DNA methylation and what factors might influence epigenetic information.  Additional experiments were performed to study the differences in gene expression and plant phenotypes in these populations.  By comparing DNA methylation patterns with gene expression or phenotype we were able to document how changes in DNA methylation could impact traits.  Several important themes emerged from the research on this project.  First, there are many differences in DNA methylation between diverse inbred lines of maize.  This variation includes examples of both epigenetic and genetic variation.  In particular, transposable elements were found to play an important role in causing differences in DNA methylation.  Second, DNA methylation is important for healthy maize plants; maize plants with severe reductions in DNA methylation are quite unhealthy and do not produce offspring.  Third, loss of even relatively small amounts of DNA methylation near genes can have profound effects on how plants grow and develop, suggesting that DNA methylation may play in important role in gene regulation. Fourth, we have developed new technologies to provide tools for monitoring DNA methylation in an efficient way, even in plants such as maize with very large genomes.  These tools can allow researchers to understand how epigenetic variation is inherited and could allow plant breeders to use epigenetic information to select new varieties.  The project has generated over 25 publications and the datasets produced by this project have been made publicly available.   This project has also led to training and educational opportunities for a diverse group of scientists as different career stages.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/26/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nathan Springer"
