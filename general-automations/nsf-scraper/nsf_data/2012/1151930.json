 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research represents an effort to advance the understanding of wildfire-atmosphere dynamics by obtaining new observations from a comprehensive field program and integrating these observations into education and community outreach. The key objectives of the project are: 1) to develop a better understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for wildfire-atmosphere interactions and how these processes influence fire behavior; 2) to improve student understanding of fire weather science through the development of an innovative fire science and fire safety outreach and education program.\r\n\r\nThe research seeks to identify the processes responsible for fire-atmosphere interactions that affect fire behavior. The research methods are based on executing an intensive measurement program that incorporates carefully planned experiments with rapid-deploy wildfire monitoring (RaDFIRE) using the newly NSF funded CSU-MAPS, mobile atmospheric profiling system. Observations will be integrated with numerical simulations made with the coupled WRF-Fire model to investigate: 1) the dynamics of fire-induced winds and their impact on fire behavior; 2) the thermodynamic structure of fire plumes and the near-surface environment.\r\n\r\nThe education component of the project plans to build a university program in fire weather research that links San Jos\u00e9 State University and the community. This component will integrate fire weather content into general education courses, improve 6th grade science learning through a teacher training workshop, and develop fire danger awareness among students living in fire danger zones by providing a novel and modern fire safety education program. The component concepts are: 1) integration of Fire Weather content into university courses; 2) K-12 Teacher Training workshop called Weather of Wildfires; 3) Red-Flag Days: A community outreach program for middle schools in the Wildland-Urban Interface aimed at providing fire safety education.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit. \r\nThe work will potentially transform wildfire research by measuring critical wildfire-atmosphere properties that have rarely been observed. This will provide the first comprehensive data set for the validation of coupled atmosphere-fire modeling systems. New observations of extreme fire-induced winds and plume thermodynamic structure will lead to major advances in knowledge and understanding of wildfire dynamics. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts. \r\nThe broader impacts of this work include:\r\n1.\tEducational activities are developed to improve student understanding of fire weather processes by developing new teacher training modules and a novel middle-school program aimed at fire danger awareness with the use of red flags as fire weather props.\r\n2.\tGreater understanding of critical fire-atmosphere processes responsible for extreme fire behavior.\r\n3.\tIncreased firefighter and public safety from the development of better prediction tools.\r\n4.\tWeb-based data portal developed to provide modeling community long-term access to datasets.",

The key objectives of the project were: (1) to develop a better understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for wildfire-atmosphere interactions and how these processes influence fire behavior; and (2) to improve student understanding of fire weather science through the development of an innovative wildfire science outreach and education program. The major outcomes of this project are summarized under the two merit review criteria set by NSF.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>1. Key outcomes from this project include the completion of four major field measurement campaigns including the FireFlux II grass fire experiment conducted in 2013, and the Rapid Deployments to Wildfires Experiment (RaDFIRE) which sampled over 30 active wildfires.</p>\n<p>2. The data collection and analyses from this project have resulted in a total of nine peer-reviewed journal articles and four publicly available datasets which may be useful for modeling plume dynamics and the micrometeorology associated with fire spread.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. Results from the FireFlux II experiment indicate that at field scales, fire spread during wind-driven grass fires is a result of increased fire-induced winds which advect hot gasses to the unburnt fuels just ahead of the fire front. These fire-induced winds increase in magnitude and blow through the flame front helping to tilt the flames and hot gasses toward the unburnt fuels causing ignition to occur.</p>\n<p>4. The RaDFIRE project resulted in a number of findings including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Direct observation of microscale (100?1,000 m) plume entrainment structures and quantification of scale, strength, and evolution of vertical-axis whole-column rotation within a wildfire plume. </li>\n<li>Process-level observations show that wildfire plumes exhibit rapid variation in injection height as they interact with ambient stratification and wind shear.</li>\n<li>During wildfires, fire-induced winds may extend as much as 1.5 km away from the fire front and the development of pyrocumulus and pyrocumulonimbus clouds was associated with higher moisture in the mid-troposphere. &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Measurements obtained by aircraft penetration into the core of a developing pyroculumulus cloud and airborne Doppler radar from above the plume top allowed for rare documentation of vigorous updrafts aloft exceeding 50 m s<sup>?1</sup>.</li>\n<li>Discovery of previously unknown smoke-induced density currents forming because of reduced solar insolation beneath smoke layers. This finding has implications for regional-scale smoke transport predictions that are not able to resolve smoke radiative effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts</strong><br /> <br /> The broader impacts of this CAREER project include a range of outcomes including the following:</p>\n<p>1. This award has helped to establish SJSU as a leading program in fire weather research and education and maintain its recognition as the only fire-line qualified meteorological research team available nationally for deployments to wildfire incidents. This has developed into a continued relationship with many state and national agencies.<br /> <br /> 2. Development of a teacher-training workshop called ?Weather of Wildfires? which was conducted four times over the course of three years with a total of over 80 participants. These teachers (grades 6-12) where given not only comprehensive lectures that covered fire behavior, fire weather, climate change, and fire danger rating systems, but were also provided in-class exercises and other activities to take back to the classroom. Assessment results indicated that the workshops successful and are now a popular and requested workshop every year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. A new General Education course on wildfire science was developed for non-science majors (METR 115: Wildfire in the Earth System). This course has been taught three times at SJSU with increasing enrollments and popularity among students. Additionally, a new module on wildfire plume dynamics has been developed for METR 164-Intro to Fire Weather using observations from the field campaign datasets.</p>\n<p>4. An outreach program was developed to introduce K-12 students to fire weather and wildfire science. Schools were visited where interactive lectures on wildfire science were given and students were provided experiential, hands-on learning using weather balloons and the mobile atmospheric profiling system. Over 400 students participated during the program period.</p>\n<p>5. A network of three field sites for fire weather and fire danger monitoring was established. The data provided from these weather stations are used by&nbsp; fire management agencies for operational purposes and the public for general weather information.</p>\n<p>6. This CAREER project has directly supported the education and training of a total of 9 full time M.S. students in meteorology at San Jos? State University. Six undergraduate students were also trained and mentored on various fire weather research projects. In addition to student training, one post-doctoral researcher was trained and mentored on this project. All students and the post-doctoral researcher are employed in their respective fields with a majority of them working in fire weather.<br /> <br /> 7. A web-based data portal was developed to provide the fire modeling community long-term access to field experiment datasets (<a
