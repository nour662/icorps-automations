 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Cassandra L. Fraser is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Chemistry Division to conduct research on difluoroboron beta-diketonates that show reversible mechanochromic luminescence.  These unusual pigments change emission color when scratched, crushed or smeared, and can self erase with time.  Difluoroboron beta-diketonate dyes will be structurally modified and their solid state and solution properties thoroughly characterized to gain better mechanistic insight into the factors influencing initial and post shear emission properties, and thermal and self-healing kinetics.\r\n \r\nThese studies will provide insight into molecular and environmental factors affecting mechanochromic luminescence and suggest ways to more effectively control properties for imaging, sensing and detection applications such as opto-mechanosensors, security inks, tamper detection, intelligence and forensic uses, unprecedented self-erasing/rewritable responsive pigments for art, design, consumer products, and more. The proposed research provides unique interdisciplinary research and training experiences for graduate, undergraduate and high school students crossing chemistry, materials science, and physics. Creative arts and architecture collaborations and related university-wide interdisciplinary programs provide opportunities to explore design across the length scales and to share the excitement of science with broader audiences.",

In 2010, our lab reported that a simple boron dye based on the sunscreen ingredient, avobenzone (AVB) displayed unusual reversible ML. That is, when thin films of BF<sub>2</sub>AVB are excited with UV light, they emit blue-green light, which, when scratched or smeared, turned yellow. Surprising, the smeared regions reverted back to their original blue-green color over minutes&rsquo; time, or in seconds, with heating. Then the dye coated surface can be marked and erased again many times. This unexpected but important finding was a first for boron compounds of this type, and at the time, was a very rare self-erasing system for any ML material. Our seminal paper has already been cited 321 times by investigators around the world. We filed a patent which has issued and call these renewable pigments Scratch the Surface Inks<sup>TM</sup> to refer to their force responsive properties and limitless potential.

We investigated dyes with different aromatic groups like benzene, naphthalene and thiophene, with halides such as F, Cl, Br or I, and greasy alkyl chains of different lengths. We also explored dyes with strapped and bulky groups that can affect the molecular structure and its ability to rotate, which in turn affects light emission. All of these parameters influence the optical properties of the dyes. Furthermore, we discovered that ML properties are even present without the BF<sub>2</sub> group. Many &beta;-diketones alone display ML that is even more rapidly recovering often times.&nbsp; Because these boron-free dyes self-erase so quickly, that poses challenges for measurement and characterization. We developed an affordable laptop camera imaging system that allows for tracking of emission changes and allowed us to see that recovery happens faster in thicker versus thinner films.
