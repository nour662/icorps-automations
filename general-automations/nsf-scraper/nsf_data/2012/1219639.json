As uncontrolled epilepsy poses a significant burden to society due to as-\r\nsociated healthcare cost, this project is aimed at the development of an automated seizure prediction\r\nsystem and brain abnormal activity classifier. To achieve this goal, optimization-based data mining\r\n(DM) approaches will be developed to quantitatively analyze the brain activity through electroen-\r\ncephalogram (EEG) data. The proposed DM techniques will excavate hidden patterns/relationships\r\nin EEGs, which will give a greater understanding of brain functions (as well as other complex sys-\r\ntems) from a system perspective. Specifically, a new DM paradigm for the seizure prediction and\r\nbrain activity classification will be developed based on novel optimization-based DM techniques for\r\nfeature selection, clustering, and classification. The proposed research will contribute to the computer\r\nscience, engineering and medical communities along the following four lines: (1) the development of\r\nnovel mathematical models and optimization techniques for DM problems and time series analysis,\r\n(2) the implementation of statistical techniques to detect patterns from selected features/clusters\r\nfor predicting seizures and classifying normal and epileptic EEG activity, (3) the utility of detection\r\ntheory and the experimental designs to assess and validate the efficacy, robustness, and uncertainty\r\nof the proposed DM paradigm as well as fine-tune the optimal parameter setting, (4) the extension\r\nof the fundamental research findings in optimization and DM to other cross-disciplinary research,\r\nwhich will constitute a new avenue of research in optimization-based DM and time series analysis.\r\nThe proposed research is very crucial to decision making processes in real world problems. Success\r\nof this research will advance the state-of-the-art in the field of optimization in DM, and have a\r\ngreatly significant impact on medical research. The research scope in this proposal touches upon\r\nseveral emerging optimization and DM problems, which are driven by ever growing computational\r\npower. The proposed research has shown a broad impact on many research fields including computer\r\nscience, operations research, computational biology, and logistics. The scope of this project itself\r\nwill broaden opportunities and enable the participation of all citizens  women and men, underrep-\r\nresented minorities, and especically persons disabled by epilepsy. Success of this proposal in seizure\r\nprediction research will relieve the anguish from this life-threatening disease and improve the life\r\nquality of at least 2 million Americans (14 millions worldwide), who are currently suffering from\r\nepilepsy regardless of race, age, or gender.",
