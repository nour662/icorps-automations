Fostering a new generation of computational biologists that possess the interdisciplinary expertise of molecular biology and computational science will significantly impact future biological and biomedical research and industry.  \r\n\r\nIEEE Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics, or GENSIPS, is a workshop sponsored by the IEEE Signal Processing Society. The goals of GENSIPS 2012 are 1) to address the systems biology issues in the emerging omics fields, especially the next-generation sequencing technologies; 2) to significantly increase the participation of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, especial woman and minority students from signal processing, computer science, biostatistics, and biological science community. This request for fund from NSF will provide travel awards to qualified graduate students and doctoral researchers to support them to present their research papers. Particularly, 20-30% of the awards will be allocated to woman and minority students. Ultimately, GENSIPS 2012 will contribute to fostering student education on computational systems biology.",
