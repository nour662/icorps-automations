 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long-term investigation of Emerald Lake and neighboring lakes and watersheds in the Sierra Nevada (California) are transforming our understanding of how mountain ecosystems are responding to global change.  The proposed research will test the hypothesis that altered climate, changing snow regime, and changes in atmospheric composition are driving biogeochemical and ecological changes in high elevation ecosystems. Data to test this hypothesis will come from studies of lake metabolism, continued assessment of the response of lake phytoplankton to changing atmospheric deposition, continued study of the coupling between climate variability and nitrogen and phosphorus biogeochemistry, enhanced measurements of atmospheric deposition, and paleolimnological study of lake sediments. This research will build on more than two decades of biological, meteorological, hydrological, and chemical measurements in high elevation sites.\r\n\r\nManagement of National Parks and Wilderness Areas in the Sierra Nevada will benefit from the results of our research. The analyses and reconstructions will provide valuable information to Federal and State scientists on long-term lake changes and likely future responses of high elevation aquatic ecosystems to climate change. This research will provide training for one graduate student at UC Riverside in the interdisciplinary study of paleoclimatology and one graduate student at UC Santa Barbara. There will be active recruitment for these students at Minority Serving Institutions of higher learning. A strong outreach program developed with Woodlake High School in Tulare County (Central Valley agricultural region) will be expanded using field experiences and data from the proposed paleo-investigations and climate reconstructions.",

Hence, our long-term and intensive studies in these environments add considerable knowledge to these disciplines. Beginning in the 1980s, our investigations examined the impact of acid rain on the Sierra Nevada which contains some of the most acid-sensitive waters in North America. This early research and our later paleolimnology studies demonstrate that Sierra Nevada lakes responded to acid deposition very early in the 20th century (1920) and that the Clean Air Act of 1970 has had a profound positive effect on the continuing recovery of these lakes from acid deposition.</p>\n<p>In the 1990s and later, our research emphasized the interactions among atmospheric deposition, soil processes and climate change in controlling lake and watershed biogeochemistry. Owing to the low phosphorus content of Sierra Nevada bedrock, weathering of parent material cannot explain the amount phosphorus found in soils and long-term atmospheric deposition represents about one-third of the phosphorus produced during the past 10,000 years of soil development. In examining N cycling we discovered that saturating and detrimental levels of nitrogen may be difficult to reach in alpine and chaparral ecosystems that undergo abrupt seasonal transition and, therefore, inherently leak nitrogen (via outflow discharge and soil nitric oxide emissions).</p>\n<p>In terms of climate change, we observed, during the past four decades, that air temperature at Emerald Lake warmed at an annual average rate of 0.86 degrees centigrade per decade, but there was no significant warming trend through time in lake temperature. This was because 94% of variation in lake temperature was regulated by snowmelt; cold snowmelt waters buffer lakes against long term warming trends. However, reductions in spring snowpack and earlier melt significantly increase the chances of lakes warming in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. &nbsp;Warmer lakes coupled with more nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich waters may lead to significant ecological effects including changes in plankton species and increased amount of benthic algae.</p>\n<p>Our paleolimnological analyses are forcing a paradigm shift in our understanding of global change and high elevation lakes. At Pear Lake, the frequency of pluvial episodes declined during the Holocene from 37 in the early Holocene (11250 to 7250 years before present (YBP)) to 22 episodes during the middle Holocene (7250 to 3000 YBP) to 15 episodes during the late Holocene (3000 cal yr YBP). High silt content in sediments, which indicates drier conditions, were more frequent in the middle and late Holocene relative to the early Holocene. The highest concentration of dry periods occurred within the last 1500 years and included the drought of 2014-2015 which caused massive tree mortality in the Sierra Nevada and may represent the driest period in the past millennium.</p>\n<p>Training of graduate students and postdocs in limnology and watershed science enhances expertise in these fields has been a major objective of our project. Through the entire lake and watershed study (1983-2018), more than 30 MS and Ph.D degrees were based on data from the Emerald Lake watershed and Tokopah Valley and which have generated more than 200 peer reviewed publications and a book.&nbsp; More than 100 young people were employed on the project since its inception in 1983, including about 3 dozen summer interns and undergraduate participants since NSF funding began in 2003.
