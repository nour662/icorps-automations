Organized by Dr. Charles R. Wallace and Dr. Linda M. Ott, both from Michigan Technological University, the PASI will bring together software engineering researchers, industrial representatives, students and practitioners in the area of software quality.  Junior researchers will be exposed to state-of-the-art research in a personal, interactive setting that is conducive to building long-term relationships.  Connections formed at the PASI may lead to a community of professionals committed to collaboration to enhance software quality throughout the Americas.\r\n\r\nThis PASI will introduce students to many important techniques in software quality.  In addition to the benefits from developing long term synergistic relationships among faculty members, post docs, and senior PhD students, the PASI is intended to help initiate student exchanges between the programs and institutions involved.  It will help make advances in several dimensions: research, teaching, and industrial practice.  Information from the institute will be available on a website hosted at Michigan Tech, which will showcase the activities that result from the PASI and will include a membership option to allow subscribers to locate others with common interests and communicate with one another through a wiki.",
