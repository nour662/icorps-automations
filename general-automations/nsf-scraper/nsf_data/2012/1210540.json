To test these hypotheses, we combine gene expression and developmental data and infer the history of the floral patterning genes to explain the diversity and evolution of floral form within the mint relatives. \nThis project found that asymmetrical expression of of floral symmetry CYC2-like genes but not their duplication is correlated with the origin of bilaterally symmetrical flowers. We also found evidence for distinct evolutionary developmental mechanisms underlying derived radially symmetrical flowers. Additionally, we found that the interactions of floral symmetry patterning genes might have evolved in a stepwise fashion. Mints and their relatives are commonly used as ornamental plants for their spectacular flowers; they thus provide an excellent backyard example for the education of the general public on evolution and development, and on plant-insect interactions. Two undergraduate students at UM-St. Louis were involved in this project and helped with DNA work and microscopy. Results from this study were presented at various scientific conferences and were published in peer-reviewed journals. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jinshun Zhong"
