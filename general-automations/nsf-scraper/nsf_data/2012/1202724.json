The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow to focus their studies in plant genomics with an emphasis on quantitative genetics, modern breeding approaches, and bioinformatics. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Cory D. Hirsch is \"A Systems Biology Approach to Understanding Anthocyanin Biosynthesis and Regulation in Potato\".  The host institution for the fellowship is Michigan State University and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Robin Buell and David Douches.\r\n\r\nAnthocyanins, the purple and red pigments found in plants, have numerous health benefits including a high anti-oxidant content with human health benefits. The scientific goals of the proposed research is to investigate anthocyanin production at the genetic, biochemical, molecular, and systems level in potato, a crop species that is emerging as an important component of the 21st century world food needs. This project will couple classical plant breeding approaches with modern technology enabled genome-wide approaches to generate and  integrate multiple data types to provide a genome-scale understanding of the mechanisms by which genes govern anthocyanin production in potato. \r\n\r\nTraining objectives include classical breeding, biochemistry, quantitative genetics and plant genomics.  Broader impacts include capacity-building and advanced training for students from the United States to engage in interdisciplinary research in plant improvement and associated sciences such as physiology, quantitative genetics, and computational biology.",
