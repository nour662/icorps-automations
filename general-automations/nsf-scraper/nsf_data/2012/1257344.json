 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to support two meetings sponsored by the High Confidence Software and Systems (HCSS) Coordinating Group (CG)of the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program, the Nation's primary source of Federally funded revolutionary breakthroughs in advanced information technologies such as computing, networking, and software. The two meetings are the 2012 National Workshop on the New Clockwork for Time-Critical Systems, which is scheduled for October 25-27, 2012 at the Hyatt Regency Baltimore Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland, and the 2012 CPS Education Workshop Planning Meeting, which is scheduled for October 24, 2012 at the Royal Sonesta Harbor Court Baltimore, also in Baltimore, Maryland. The objective of the New Clockwork workshop is to define a list of needs for research on time-critical aspects of cyber-physical systems so that future research can develop robust foundations for reasoning about time in cyber-physical systems across scales, managing resources to meet timeliness requirements, and ensuring service agreements through new tools, techniques and methodologies. The workshop will be structured as a sequence of panels, presentations and breakout sessions. The workshop will produce a report for the HCSS agencies.  The objective of the CPS Education Planning Meeting is to lay groundwork for a workshop that would perform a similar analysis of future educational needs and directions in support of high confidence cyber-physical systems. Both meetings will include participation by invited researchers and representatives from Government and industry.",
