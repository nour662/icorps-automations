 "awd_abstract_narration": "The release and movement of magmatic volatile components, including water, carbon dioxide, sulfur, and chlorine, exert significant control on the conditions of volcanic eruptions and on the transport and deposition of potential ore metals. Many of the parameters critical for understanding these processes are invisible to direct observations because they occur up to several kilometers beneath the surface of the Earth.   Researchers have suggested that other trace elements both in the magma and in crystals forming within it may be used as a proxy for interpreting volatile behavior in magma and fluids.  However many of the basic variables which describe how these elements are incorporated into crystals are unknown or are in question.  \r\n\r\nThis study builds off observations about enrichment in different trace elements analyzed in crystals from the recent eruption (2004) of Mount St. Helens by 1) conducting hydrothermal experiments at various conditions to try to better constrain many of these questionable variables and 2) expand on the work at Mount St. Helens to look for similar elemental variations at other volcanoes, including Mt. Pinatubo, Philippines; Augustine volcano, Alaska; and Mt. Guardia, Lipari. Specifically, this work will focus on an experimental and analytical study of the elements, Li, Cu, Zn, Pb, W, and Mo.  These elements are of particular interest as prior studies have suggested they are likely to be transported by volatiles (such as water, CO2, etc).  The experimental results will be integrated with observations from multiple volcanic centers to fully understand the origins of these element enrichments and how this relates to the movement of volatiles in silicic magma systems and how volatile transfer influences processes of eruption and mineral deposit formation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe formation and migration of fluid phases (containing the volatile compounds or elements water, carbon dioxide, sulfur, chlorine and fluorine) in magmas can control volcanic eruptive behaviors; and a long-standing goal of volcanological studies has been to determine the location, rates, and timing of fluid movement.  Understanding volatile behavior is also fundamentally important for studying magmas that are genetically involved in the fluid-based transport of copper, gold, molybdenum, and other metals to form economic mineral deposits.  Magmatic fluids also transport other fluid-soluble and fluid-mobile components like lithium and boron, and these trace components can be applied as geochemical tracers of fluid formation and movement.\n\nA natural volcanic rock sample (rhyodacite in composition) was melted at high temperature and pressure, doped with additional trace elements (lithium, copper, zinc and others), and then cooled and quenched to a metal-enriched glass in an experimental laboratory.  This glass was remelted and reacted with volatile-rich fluids with or without minerals in subsequent hydrothermal experiments to determine how the compositions of the melt; a variety of water-dominated fluids; and the minerals pyroxene, plagioclase, and amphibole changed as temperature varied from 720 to 1050&deg;C, pressure from 50 to 400 MPa, and as oxygen fugacity and fluid composition were modified.  Melt inclusion glasses and minerals in volcanic rock samples from Augustine volcano, Alaska, were also analyzed and the results of the experimental data were applied to the natural melt inclusion and mineral compositions to interpret how its magmas evolved chemically (with a particular focus on the behaviors of lithium, copper, zinc and other trace/ore metals).  Additional laboratory experiments were conducted with the mineral apatite [Ca5(PO4)3(OH,Cl,F)] to determine how water, fluorine and chlorine are distributed between a rhyolitic melt, fluids, and apatite at 50 and 200 MPa of pressure.  The experimental apatite-melt-fluid compositional data were then applied to compositions of natural apatites from Augustine volcano in order to better interpret Augustine?s magma evolution and eruption processes.\n\nThis award supported the successful completion of the PhD research of two graduate students, and 6 scientific publications were generated.  Some award funds were used to support two in-house teaching events at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) as well as a day-long field trip to the Sterling Hill Mine and Museum, NJ.  These combined events involved 30 former graduate students from the AMNH Masters in Arts and Teaching program that are now serving as Earth Science teachers.  The teachers brought 101 of their geology students to these events; the students primarily involved women and members of under-represented groups from New York City high-needs, middle and high schools.  The teacher and student participants were lectured in and studied rock samples bearing on hydrothermal, magmatic, and mineralizing processes.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James D Webster"
