 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current measurements of energy spectra, anisotropy, particle composition, and proton-air cross section demonstrate that the Pierre Auger Observatory has an unprecedented view of the high-energy Universe and access to particle physics at energies beyond the LHC. With Auger now operating in its full configuration of Surface Detector (SD) stations and air Fluorescence Detectors (FD), the data collected thus far presents interesting puzzles and exciting opportunities. The suppression of the energy spectrum above 60 EeV implies a Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) or GZK-like effect that screens the isotropic distant Universe. Events above 55 EeV show hints of extra-galactic anisotropy within this horizon. FD elongation rate measurements currently extend only to 30 EeV but suggest either a transition from lighter to heavier primaries, or a glimpse of new physics beyond LHC energies. These measurements have strong implications about the nature of the highest energy sources. \r\n\r\nThis award will support this group in leading the effort to complete an upgrade to the suite of atmospheric laser test beam systems at the Observatory. Pulsed lasers probe Auger's enormous dynamic atmospheric calorimeter and generate air shower-like tracks in the FDs. Planned applications include monitoring the end-to-end absolute photometric calibration of the FD to better than 5%, a necessary step to reduce the uncertainty on the energy scale. This has implication in the determination of the volume up to the GZK horizon. Other applications include an independent precision measurement of the largest time-varying calibration term (aerosol optical depth) via Raman LIDAR. This group will also extend methods that they have developed to search for exotic particles. A technique to measure the speed of extensive air showers has been benchmarked against laser shots and then applied to stereo and hybrid events. The technique is sensitive to massive exotic objects traveling at a fraction of the speed of light that are able to generate an optical signature in the FD. \r\n\r\nAmong the Broader Impacts planned under this award is the development of a relationship with an area high school for at-risk youth. The group envisions a program of physics demonstrations that make use of material developed for the Mines modern physics courses, including a cloud chamber and coincident particle detectors. The role of aerosols in climate forcing is not well understood. There are relatively few aerosol profile measurements in the southern hemisphere. Raman LIDAR is a standard technique that will both enhance the usefulness of the Auger atmospheric data and enable more direct comparisons with data in the atmospheric science community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported a research team at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) to study the highest energy cosmic rays using the Pierre Auger cosmic ray observatory (Auger)  This international facility features the largest cosmic ray detector in the world. Spanning some 3000 km2,  the Auger Observatory uses the atmosphere as an enormous calorimter. Located in the Mendoza Province of Argentina, Auger measures the highest energy subatomic particles known to exist in the universe. The energy per particle reaches 1020 electron volts.  At the highest energies, the rates fall below one per square mile per century. The sources of these mysterious particles are unknown. Nearly all the information about the universe beyond the solar system has been derived from measurements of photons (radio, IR, UV, visible, x-ray, gamma rays). In contrast, the cosmic ray particles measured by Auger produce interactions in the earth's atmosphere that are consistent with subatomic nuclei.  So Auger observes the universe an energy scale some 6 orders beyond the highest energy photons seen to date, and with a different messenger particle.\n\nUnder this award, the CSM group focused on three specific main areas of research.  \n\n\n1. Laser Test Beams and atmospherics\n The most precise cosmic ray extensive air shower measurements are made by the the optical air fluorescence detector (FD).  The FD tracks the faint traces of UV light produced by the secondary particles.  The atmount of light is proportional to the energy of the primary high energy particle. \n\nSince the rate is so low and since particle test beams are not available, the Colorado School of Mines group is responsible for an alternative method.  This method uses calibrated pulsed UV laser beams directed into the atmosphere from two facilities near the center of the observatory.  The lasers produced tracks in the optical cosmic ray detectors.  The tracks are as bright as the highest energy cosmic ray tracks.  The laser  tracks can be used to measure the clarity of the dynamic \"atmospheric calorimeter\". Based on these measurements, we find that the atmospheric transmission correction factor to the measured cosmic ray energies can vary by a factor of 2 between clear and hazy periods.  This  matters because the cosmic ray energy and the cosmic ray source distance are expected to be correlated at the highest energies.\n\nTo cross check this important correction, we upgraded one of the laser facilities with a custom Raman LIDAR system that makes a best practices independent measurement of the atmospheric clarity.  (The Raman LIDAR was developed by colleages at the University of Naples Italy and tested extensively in the field in Colorado prior to shipment.)  The upgrade also included a number of significant infrastructure improvements. The entire system is now operating automatically in Argentina and comparisions are in progress.\n\nFrom an interdisciplinary persepctive this Raman LIDAR is one of a very few that operate routinely in the southern part of the southern hemisphere.\n\n2. A search for exotic particles\n\nA search for exotic signatures was conducted.  It used speed in the atmosphere as a constraint. The benchmarking of the method uses laser shots from the laser facilities described above. At present, a theoretically predicted  type of dark matter known as \"Q-balls\"  might be observed by this search if they were to exist with certain properties. However, the search is not restricted to any particular object. The methods were applied to 7 years of data.  A review of the outliers so far doesn\u00c6t yield strong slow shower candidates.\n\n3. Improving methods to search for point sources of cosmic rays\n\nCSM group found that data scans for possible cosmic ray point sources  were quite sensitive to the minimum event energy of the data sample selected for the search.  An improved scanning algorighm that includes experimental uncertainity in the measured energies and point directions of the events more robustly has been d..."
