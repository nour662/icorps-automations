 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Defense of Food (IDOF) is a media and outreach project based on Michael Pollan's best-selling book of the same title.  Through the lens of food science, IDOF is designed to engage diverse audiences in learning about: (1) how science research is conducted, (2) how research findings are used in media, marketing, and public policy, and (3) how to apply food science research in everyday life.  IDOF will be created by Kikim Media, an independent production company, broadcast and distributed by PBS and supported by an extensive outreach campaign and interactive website.  The project's educational materials will be developed, in part, by the Teacher's College at Columbia University's Center for Food and Nutrition, with dissemination supported by the Coalition for Science After School and by Tufts University's Healthy Kids Out of School initiative, which involves nine of the leading out of school time (OST) organizations, such as Girl Scouts USA, and the National Urban League.  The project advisory committee includes highly respected researchers in food, nutrition, and health.\r\n\r\nIDOF will use an integrated strategy of learning resources, combining a television documentary with online/social media, community outreach, and youth activities.  Knight Williams Research Communications will conduct formative and summative evaluation of all major components of the project.  The results will advance the informal science community's understanding of how the combination of a documentary with outreach, website/social media, and afterschool activities impacts motivation and learning.  The evaluation study will pay special attention to the degree to which participation in the community events, social media/website, and afterschool activities motivates deeper or extended engagement with the subject.  Project evaluation results and educational resources will be widely disseminated to the informal science community. \r\n\r\nIDOF includes a two-hour documentary film that will be produced in both English and Spanish; a community-level outreach campaign focused on reaching underserved audiences who may not watch public television; a set of activities for use in afterschool programs, youth programs and schools; and an interactive and content-rich website with tightly integrated social media tools.  IDOF will be nationally broadcast by PBS; the Spanish-language version of IDOF will be broadcast by Vme Television.  The ambitious IDOF educational materials and outreach campaign, combined with interactive web and social media, will reach large and diverse audiences.  The intended impacts on audiences include increased knowledge and understanding of the scientific process by learning what food scientists do, what techniques they use, and how scientists arrive at their conclusions; the development of critical thinking skills audiences can use when evaluating messages about food and nutrition in media and advertising and when making decisions about what food to buy and eat; and becoming active learners and consumers regarding food.  Evaluation results will be widely disseminated to science media producers and the informal science community via professional publications and presentations at conferences.  The ultimate value of the In Defense of Food documentary and learning initiative will be to enhance public understanding of the crucial importance of science in people's everyday lives and in shaping dozens of daily decisions.",

Our goal has been to&nbsp;enhance public understanding of the crucial importance of science in people&rsquo;s everyday lives and in shaping dozens of daily decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>In Defense of Food</em>&nbsp;was nationally broadcast in primetime by PBS on December 30th, 2015. The film was subsequently nominated for a News and Documentary Emmy Award for Outstanding Information Programming, received the Grand Prize in the International Life Sciences Film Festival in Prague and has been screened at the prestigious Berlinale Film Festival, Mill Valley Film Festival, and many others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An extensive publicity effort prior to the broadcast resulted in the publication of more than 50 articles across nearly 150 print and online platforms. In addition, there were several radio stories about the program and a PBS Newshour segment featuring Michael Pollan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the week of the initial broadcast, nearly 3 million viewers watched the film either on air or through streaming media. Spanish-language versions of the film, in both one-hour and full two-hour lengths, were subsequently broadcast on Vme, which is often called the \"Spanish-language PBS.\" &nbsp;The Vme trailer for this series had over 1,050 views on the network&rsquo;s YouTube channel, which is very high compared to other premieres. The Vme broadcasts reached approximately 100,000 viewers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the television version of the film, Kikim created a 78-minute version for use in film festivals and community screenings. &nbsp;As of November 23, 2016,&nbsp;79 community screenings have been held (including screenings on 8 college campuses), with another 15 upcoming screenings already confirmed, bringing the total to&nbsp;94 screenings in 21 states and the District of Columbia. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To support our community and educational outreach activities we created a Community Screening Toolkit, a House Party Toolkit and Discussion Guide in both Spanish and English, and a 10-part Curriculum aimed at middle school-aged students, which included take-home sheets for parents in both English and Spanish.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We made these materials available through <a href=\"http://pbs.org/\">PBS.org</a> as well as through a separate site we created that allowed us to track signups and follow up with individuals who were interested in using our materials. More than 1,000 people requested materials, of whom 218 downloaded the Screening Toolkit, 200 downloaded the House Party Toolkit, and 359 asked for further information about how to eat a healthier diet. Twelve hundred people downloaded the curriculum from Kikim or PBS, of whom 83 have either used it or confirmed their intention to do so in 2017. In addition to distributing the curriculum directly, we also teamed up with several organizations that distributed it through their own networks.</p>\n<p>Social media (and a Social Media Toolkit we distributed to interested partners) played an important role in raising awareness of the program. &nbsp;Our Facebook page received 8,769 likes and was widely shared; on the evening of the PBS broadcast more than 15,000 people were actively using the Facebook site. We also posted frequently on Twitter and Instagram.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>In Defense of Food</em>&nbsp;has also established a significant international footprint. &nbsp;The film has been screened&nbsp;31 times at 16 different festivals,&nbsp;with another 3 festivals already booked for 2017. Through these screenings, the film has reached audiences in 16 countries: the&nbsp;United States, Canada (Nova Scotia &amp; Vancouver), Mexico, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Poland, the Czech Republic, Italy, Australia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Hungary, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. The film has been sold to television networks in more than 40 countries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The final evaluation of the project showed that&nbsp;viewers of the program were interested in the film&rsquo;s focus on nutrition science, nutritionism and marketing, and how these fields have shaped the Western diet over time. Others praised the film for inspiring&nbsp;them to reflect on their own diet and eating practices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Viewers also consistently reported that watching the film increased their likelihood of engaging in healthier eating practices and food purchases. Almost all felt that as a result of watching the film they knew more about how to critically analyze food-related marketing and advertising and could give an example of what they would look for. &nbsp;Furthermore, almost all viewers expected that, as a result of watching the film, they would apply what they learned about food-related marketing and advertising in their own lives.</p>\n<p>Educators who used the curriculum generally agreed that their students&rsquo; knowledge of food/nutrition science concepts and research procedures increased; that their ability to analyze how food/nutrition science has changed our food system increased; and that they expressed an interest in seeking more information about the topics in the curriculum.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;Schwarz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224172/1224172_10212250_1480544056094_DVDCover--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224172/1224172_10212250_1480544056094_DVDCover--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"DVD cover\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224172/1224172_10212250_1480544056094_DVDCover--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"DVD cover\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The cover of the In Defense of Food DVD</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">John Clark and Gabriel Wilson (lettuce photo);
