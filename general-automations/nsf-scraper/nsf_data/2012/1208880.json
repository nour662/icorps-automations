 "awd_abstract_narration": "Howard University is one of only 48 U.S. private, Doctoral/Research-Extensive universities and one of the premier Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the country.  The submission of their institutional transformation proposal comes at a very propitious time in their history as over 50% of their faculty are retiring in the next five years leaving a huge need for STEM hiring that could be truly transformative.  Howard has a strong history of advancing Women of Color, especially STEM women, into administrative positions.  Their activities center around three goals- broad stakeholder education, changes related to institutional and individual advocacy, and individual empowerment through training and opportunity.  Howard University presents NSF with an important opportunity to expand our knowledge of institutional transformation at HBCUs and this proposal is uniquely designed to do this through the national archive on the scholarship of women of color in STEM (e.g., leadership, professional experiences, and accomplishments), their basic data collection and evaluation efforts, and the proposed social science research.   The social science research is a strong, theoretically-based, mixed-method approach to understanding women in STEM, and specifically URM women in STEM which should contribute meaningfully to the literature.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHU ADVANCE-IT project has been a success and provided Women STEM faculty more clarity regarding their individual career goals and trajectories through its Education, Advocacy and Empowerment programs, including professional development. Many of our women faculty reported to us that they never thought about preparing a promotion package to the rank of Professor (full) without the influence and encouragement and programming of HU ADVANCE-IT. As a result of HU ADVANCE-IT, the number of STEM women faculty at the highest academic rank ( Professor)  has more than doubled since the start of the project. \n\nThere has been a dramatic shift in the decanal leadership at the University,  In 2012 when HU ADVANCE-IT began, there were three female Deans overall at Howard University, but none in STEM. At the end of our ADVANCE grant  the majority of the deans were female ( 9 out of 13).   At the start of our project in 2012, there were no STEM women Deans and at the end of our project this remained unchanged. A women STEM Dean was  hired to lead the Medical School soon after our NSF award ended which we still consider a success. \n\nHU ADVANCE-IT impacted multiple disciplines.  For example, HU ADVANCE-IT has had a significant impact on the advancement of the research productivity of a cohort of Howard University women faculty in multiple STEM disciplines. This cohort leveraged the research capacity and productivity that their HU ADVANCE-IT Mini Grants provided to secure research grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements. Agencies include the National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, Office of Naval Research, National Institutes of Health, and Private Foundations.  Thus, the generation and transfer of knowledge that will be afforded by these awards will have a profound impact on discovery and innovation across the fields in which these women STEM faculty's research is situated.  Among the research areas of these STEM women faculty's externally funded research are as follows: Artificial Intelligence, Information Sciences, Physics and Quantum Applications of Technology, Developmental Biology, and Molecular &amp; Cellular Biosciences.\n\nHU ADVANCE-IT provided the impetus for the university to invest in the creation of the administrative leadership position, Associate Provost of Faculty Development.  In fact, one of our stated goals for the sustainability of our empowerment initiatives (and others) for HU ADVANCE-IT was to convince the university to appoint its first Associate Provost of Faculty Development.  And to ensure that this position was fully integrated into the budget and organizational structure of academic leadership within the Howard University Office of the Provost &amp; Chief Academic Officer.  The position of Associate Provost for Faculty Development has continued for the past five years. \n\nThe HU ADVANCE-IT Experience Study offers the emerging field of the Science of Broadening Participation knowledge, theory, and research that can propel the field forward.  For example, the HU ADVANCE-IT Experience designed and piloted a mixed methods research design that was culturally sensitive to capturing the lived experience of women of color who choose academic careers in a university setting with an HBCU designation.  Few HBCUs in the country, offer a comprehensive set of STEM departments across multiple schools and colleges within the university.  This implies that women STEM faculty at Howard University have significant responsibility for simultaneously meeting the demands for the career advancement of high level engagement in the teaching, research, and service enterprised of a university setting.  This often includes the recruitment, training, and professional development of doctoral students in STEM.
