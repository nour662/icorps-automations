 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Jessica Frances Kamhi of Boston University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Neurobiology of individual and collective behavior in a superorganism, the weaver ant\" during the summer of 2012 at James Cook University in Townsville, Queensland, Australia.  The host scientist is Simon Robson.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to advance understanding of the neurobiology of worker behavior and collective intelligence.  Ants, as pinnacles of social evolution in insects, are renowned for their cohesive and complex group living, yet the extent to which selection for collective behavior has shaped the worker brain is poorly understood, and how the structure of the weaver ant brain underscores behavioral differentiation and cooperation has yet to be explored.  By studying both worker task performance and the synaptic connections in sensory and integrative processing regions of the worker brain, the research elucidates how worker brain structure in the socially advanced weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina, is involved in individual and colony-level actions. \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Australian weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina, is often considered one of the most socially complex ant species due to its elaborate leaf nest construction and highly territorial behavior of its large, arboreal colonies.  Although colonies are socially complex, individual workers have minute brains, raising questions concerning their behavioral capabilities.  Workers cooperate in part through specializing on particular tasks: small workers, minors, typically remain within the nest and care for immatures while larger workers, majors, forage and defend the colony.  Within this morphologically based division of labor, younger majors remain within the nest and leave the nest as they mature.  It is unknown what role the brain plays in the task performance of ants of different ages and morphologically distinct subcastes of majors and minors.  My project determined how the brain structure and sensory systems of majors and minors of different ages vary by quantifying the number of microglomeruli, groups of synaptic connections, within distinct regions of visual and olfactory sensory integration in the mushroom bodies, a region involved in learning and memory.  Microglomeruli are considered proxies for cognitive processing capability. \n\nMy results suggest that there is variability in microglomerular densities that corresponds to sensory processing needs.  Comparing the two morphologically distinct worker subcastes, adult major workers have significantly more dense microglomeruli in the visual input region of the brain than minors.  This finding is consistent with their social behavior: minors rarely leaving the dark interior of the nest whereas majors are often found outside the nest foraging or defending their territory utilizing visual cues.  Major worker pupae have significantly higher densities of microglomeruli in the collar than older majors, suggesting that exposure to light results in synaptic pruning as seen in other ants (Steib et al., 2012). \n\nMy work bridges the fields of sociobiology and neurobiology to understand how superorganisms like weaver ants act both as individuals and groups, and how their social behavior influences brain evolution.  Current results identify microglomerular densities as an important neural element involved in age- and subcaste-related division of labor.  Additionally, by studying the neural mechanisms that lead to the weaver ant\u00c6s complex cooperative tasks, my research contributes to our understanding of how social evolution has shaped the brain of a socially complex invertebrate.\n\n \n\nStieb, S.M., Hellwig, A., Wehner, R., and W.
