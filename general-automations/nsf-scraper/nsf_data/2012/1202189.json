 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to demonstrate reliable deposition of solution processed electronic materials over large areas in order to obtain stable device performance and allow integration of components of sensing systems that are mechanically flexible. The program will investigate methods of obtaining stability at every step of device fabrication: ink formulation, ink deposition, solvent removal, thin film morphology and device electrical stability.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is the demonstration of reliable and stable fabrication of printed flexible electronics. The program will address two of the most challenging aspects of printing electronics: reliable deposition of multi-layers and device-to-device variations. A process for suspending semiconducting polymers as nanoparticle dispersions in water will be developed and as a consequence allow layer-to-layer deposition from benign solvents with high interfacial quality. Device stability and reliability will be studied in two types of structures; photodiodes and thin film transistors. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are contributions to the fundamental understanding of materials processing and device fabrication using printing. The goal of developing reliable printing conditions over large flexible areas is applicable to a range of electronic devices and sensors based on organic materials. The approach of processing organic materials from aqueous nanoparticle dispersion will enable the demonstration of precise deposition of multiple polymer layers from solution. The PI is engaged with several outreach programs that offer research experiences to high school teachers and students. Within this program, simple printed electronic devices will be developed and integrated with existing educational programs targeting the enrichment of pre-college education.",
