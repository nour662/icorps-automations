Nauplii remain under-studied due to the limitations of conventional techniques and an historical emphasis on studying the larger mesozooplankton. However, there is increasing recognition that nauplii play important roles in food web dynamics, and considerable evidence that nauplii may be important trophic intermediaries between microbial and classical food webs due to their high abundance, high weight-specific ingestion rates, and ability to feed on relatively small particles. This team of investigators is developing a novel molecular approach to studying diverse populations of nauplii in mixed field samples based on quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). They propose to complete development and validation of this qPCR-based technique for enumeration of nauplii, and evaluate its utility in the field. The specific objectives of this research are to identify and reduce technical and biological sources of error in the methodology, determine the accuracy of the method across a range of environmental conditions, and complete one paired field experiment that compares the grazing impact of naupliar and protozoan micro-grazers in a model subtropical coastal ecosystem.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the project will include training of graduate and undergraduate students, inclusion of research results in graduate and undergraduate courses at the University of Hawaii,  Manoa, and public outreach through the web and in public venues.  These PIs have a strong track record of engaging under-represented students in research, and particular emphasis will be placed on recruiting and training students from under-represented backgrounds.",

Tests on cultured <em>P. crassirostris </em>mtCOI copy number compared to measurements of carbon across developmental stage found a log-linear relationship across a five order of magnitude in animal biomass.

Storm-associated runoff provides a pulse of nutrients, fueling rapid spikes in phytoplankton production that are often followed by dramatic increases in abundance of the early life stages of copepods (copepod nauplii). In Kane&lsquo;ohe Bay, recruitment of nauplii of three species was found to be low but stable during non-storm ecosystem states. In contrast, a first-flush winter storm resulted in a rapid increase in early-stage nauplii, with ephemeral shifts in species dominance within the naupliar community. Within 2-4 days following the storm, <em>Parvocalanus crassirostris </em>naupliar DNA quantities were up to an order of magnitude greater than pre-storm levels; while the response in the other species was more modest (up to five-fold increase), and in the case of <em>Oithona attenuata,</em> delayed. Despite the rapid increase in naupliar biomass, the majority of the early naupliar production was lost within 10 days of the storm. Up to 99% of daily early naupliar biomass and a maximum of 13 mg C m<sup>-3</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> of <em>Oithona simplex</em> was removed from the naupliar community before reaching mid-stage nauplii. These results underscore how responses to ecosystem perturbation differ among species and the ephemeral nature of the response, observations made possible by the novel qPCR approach.</p>\n<p>The trophic roles of copepod nauplii in planktonic food webs in Kane&lsquo;ohe Bay also were investigated. Ingestion rates of <em>Parvocalanus crassirostris</em> and <em>Bestiolina similis</em> mid-stage (N3-N4) nauplii on natural prey assemblages were measured to evaluate prey preferences and estimate the trophic impact of grazing by each species. The two species overlapped in the range of prey removed, however <em>P. crassirostris</em> nauplii grazed less selectively than nauplii of <em>B. similis,</em> which avoided 2-5 &micro;m prey while showing positive selection for 20-35 &micro;m prey. <em>Parvocalanus crassirostris</em> had a greater trophic impact on prey populations due to <em>in situ</em> naupliar abundances that were 2 to 11-fold higher than <em>B. similis</em>. The combined grazing impacts by the two species ranged from 1.0 to 8.7% of the 2-35 &micro;m prey biomass.

Michelle Jungbluth completed a MS (2012) and PhD (2016) based on research related to this award.  Two postdoctoral fellows also conducted research on copepod nauplii in association with this award (Carolyn Faithfull, Katherine Hanson), as well as four undergraduate students that received training in laboratory and field research.\n\nOur research in Kaneohe Bay served as the basis for outreach to the public in the SOEST Open House (2013, 2015), educating 1000s of school children about planktonic organisms and their ecosystem roles.  In addition, PI Goetze draws extensively from research conducted in the Bay to support place-based learning in a large-enrollment undergraduate course in marine science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (Science of the Sea, 380 students enrolled in 2016-17 AY).  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/15/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erica Goetze"
