 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund the continuation of a successful survey of white-dwarf supernova explosions (called \"Type I\") at telescopes in Arizona and Chile.  The main goal of the work will be to compare low redshift (nearby) supernovae with their high-redshift (distant) counterparts, especially through observations in the infrared which can reduce the effects of dust.  Under earlier funding from NSF, this group has assembled a large and homogeneous set of Type I supernovae light curves and spectra, developed original methods for using them using advanced statistical techniques, and addressed problems of cosmic expansion such as local flows, the Hubble constant, cosmic acceleration and the nature of the dark energy.\r\n\r\nThe project is expected to advance the study of dark energy, which makes up most of the universe.  Results from this survey will be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum at Harvard, and students will be involved in the research.  The award will also support ongoing efforts outreach and public education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project studied exploding stars and their use to measure the history of the universe.  \n\nSupernova explosions end a star's long life that extends over millions or even billions of years, but in the explosion, a single star can shine billion times brighter than the Sun.  During the star's long lifetime, nuclear fusion changes light elements, like hydrogen, into heavier ones like the oxygen you are breathing and the calcium in your bones.  In this very concrete way, studying supernova explosions is part of finding out where we (and our planet Earth) came from.  \n\nBecause of their extreme energy output, we can see supernova explosions out to great distances in the universe, halfway back to the Big Bang.  This means that supernovae can be used to trace the history of cosmic expansion.  While astronomers expected to see that expansion gradually slowing due to gravity, that is not what we found just 20 years ago.  Instead, the early evidence let us to conclude something extraordinary-- that the expansion of the universe was actually speeding up.  We attributed this to the effect of a mysterious \"dark energy\" that acts to make the space between galaxies stretch out faster over time.  \n\nDuring the period of this grant, we have pursued these two ideas studying supernova for themselves and for studying the history of the universe.  Our approach has been mostly observational, using the telescopes of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and also NSF-sponsored facilities like Gemini, ALMA, and the VLA to learn more about how stars explode to produce the heavy elements, stir the gas between the stars, and provoke the formation of new solar systems.  For a special type of supernova that has a nearly uniform light output, we have worked hard to understand what they are and what they do, but also to use them to trace cosmic acceleration with higher precision than has been done in the past.
