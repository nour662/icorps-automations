 "awd_abstract_narration": "Testing and developing new tools for analyses of phylogenomic data to resolve the tree of life\r\n\r\nResolving rapid radiations in the tree of life is a major challenge of evolutionary biology. Advances in next-generation sequencing technology aim at ameliorating this challenge by expanding the amount of sequence data available for each species. The incorporation of next-generation sequencing into current phylogenetic approaches requires innovative methods of analysis. This project will develop new models for the analysis of next generation sequence data with the aim of resolving the phylogenetic relationships of rapid radiations. The use of complex and realistic simulations will test current and new phylogenetic models for the efficacy of analyzing next-generation data. Simulation studies will provide the benchmarks for next-generation phylogenetic study design.\r\n\r\nTraining objectives include developing expertise in mathematical modeling, data simulation, and bioinformatics. Educational outreach includes mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students in biological sciences and creation of public exhibits in the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. Broader impacts include development of open-source software tools and incorporation of new models into existing programs such as BEAST, BEAGLE, and RevBayes. Dissemination of results will occur through peer-reviewed publication in open-access journals, presentations at scientific meetings, and all data will be made publicly available.",
