Following the symposium, a post-symposium review panel will be convened to review and critique the framework, using specified criteria.  Staff members from the New York Hall of Science will then integrate the reviews into a revised framework document. The project has broader policy implications for larger assessment systems in informal learning environments such as the Mozilla Badges initiative.",
