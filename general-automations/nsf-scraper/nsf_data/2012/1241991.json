Organized by Dr. Peter Guttorp, a professor of Statistics, Quantitative Ecology & Resource Management, and Urban Design & Planning at the , University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, the institute will focus on spatial and spatio-temporal models and their statistical analysis, with lectures in theory and applications as well as practical computing exercises.  The content will be linked together with advanced applications in climatology, ecology and environmental health and provide a comprehensive software archive for these methods, most of which have not been publicly available. \r\n\r\nThis PASI will introduce participants to many important techniques, including state-of-the-art methods in modeling.  The activity will also foster international collaboration among researchers from the US and the Americas.  The educational content of the institute and its materials will be disseminated through an integrated web site, containing presentations, software, annotated bibliography and a variety of resource links.  In addition, institute participants will receive guidance in producing white papers for publication.",
