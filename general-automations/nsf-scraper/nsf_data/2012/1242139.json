 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, \"NUE: Enhancing Undergraduate Students Learning and Research Experiences through Hands on Experiments on Bio-nanoengineering\", at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University (NCAT), under the direction of Dr. Narayan Bhattarai, will bring together a team of interdisciplinary faculty members from the Department of Chemical and Bioengineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Chemistry to enhance undergraduate student learning in bioengineering by introducing training on devices and systems that integrate nanoscale technologies with biological systems for the development of new materials, biomimetic nanostructures and tools.    \r\n\r\nNCAT's College of Engineering is consistently among the top two producers of African-American engineers in the nation. The proposed NUE project is expected to provide a significant number of underrepresented minority students with training and mentoring focused on bio-nanoengineering.  Further the undergraduate students impacted by this program are expected to add to the talent pool for NCAT's graduate programs in traditional as well as in nontraditional engineering and science disciplines such as Bioengineering, Nanoscience and Nanoengineering, and Computational Science and Engineering.",
