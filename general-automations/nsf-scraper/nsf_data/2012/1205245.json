Hess in 1912. We now know this radiation as cosmic rays. This symposium will be held to celebrate this anniversary, to summarize the current status in this field, and to look forward to the new scientific questions to be asked and answered. \r\n\r\nFor Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students. In addition, all sessions will be open to the interested public and there will be at least one evening session in which a public lecture with a title something like \"The Origin of Cosmic Rays: A 100 Year Perspective\" will be given by one of the participants.",
