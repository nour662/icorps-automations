 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of comparative morphology has been revolutionized by the application of high resolution digital imaging methods to non-invasively visualize complex physiological features. However, truly quantitative characterization and comparison of complex morphological features still cannot be adequately addressed by existing methods, which are typically developed only for idealized 2D images or surfaces. The accurate and efficient characterization and comparison of shapes with 3D noisy imaging data represents highly non-trivial computational problems which have yet to be adequately addressed in comparative morphology studies, nor has efficient computational software been made available to the researchers. The goal of this project is to develop advanced computational methods for accurate quantitative characterization and comparison of specimen morphology from high resolution 3D voxel-based digital imaging modalities. With the growing recognition of the importance of digital libraries of biological specimens derived from advanced imaging methods, such as the NSF funded Digital Fish Library (DFL) and Digital Morphology (DigiMorph) projects, advanced methods for utilizing these data are of great importance, but pose significant technical challenges. Two broad classes of problems are of critical importance: 1) The ability to quantitatively characterize complicated morphological features from high resolution volumetric data and 2) Methods for comparing such features between specimens. Our objective is to develop two specific computational methods for geometric morphological analysis that can optimally characterize and compare geometric features embedded within real 3D imaging data, and are robust to noise and resolution limitations: 1) A novel shape analysis method based on signatures derived from spherical wave decomposition of 3D images; 2) A robust non-linear spatial normalization method based on diffeomorphic image and landmark registration. The spatial normalization methods will allow homologous structures to be correctly non-linearly warped to each other or a common template for comparison, while the decomposition method will facilitate robust, efficient, accurate, and automated characterization of shapes embedded within complex 3D datasets. These methods can then be used to generate species-specific atlases that define normative morphologies, thus facilitating both inter- and intra-specific comparative analyses. These methods will then be applied to the general problem of automated shape segmentation, then tested on two problems of significant biological importance: 1) Co-evolution of the short-tailed opossum inner ear and cranium and 2) Three-spine stickleback evolution from freshwater to saltwater species.\r\n\r\nCharacterization and comparison of morphological (form, shape, or structure) variations is a problem of significant impact across a wide range of biological disciplines. The rise of 3D volumetric imaging methods for digitizing biological samples offers great possibilities for addressing these issues but requires a theoretical and computational framework capable of allowing researchers efficient and accurate methods for analyzing complicated biological structures embedded within 3D volumetric noisy digital data. The goal of this project is to develop computational tools to address the two primary issues at the heart of these analyses: The ability to accurately and efficiently 1) characterize complex morphological features and 2) compare morphological features between specimens. The ability to perform these is critical to facilitating the use of all digital library data for quantitative morphology but to date have not been developed. The goal of this proposal is to develop analysis software to fill this significant\r\ngap in the bridge between digital imaging methods and its ultimate potential for transforming the field of comparative morphology by developing computational methods to address a broad range of morphological questions that inform our knowledge of the evolution and diversification of species. The methods developed by this project will greatly extend the capabilities of researchers and students to incorporate quantitative anatomical measurements into the study of evolutionary biology. The methods are general and applicable to any 3D imaging modality and thus will be of utility to any digital library and will serve as a platform on which new technologies and methodologies can be applied in the future. The resulting analysis tools will be open source and disseminated to researchers through the DFL website (http://www.digitalfishlibrary.org). A corresponding public education exhibit will be developed at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium (http://www.cabrillomarineaquarium.org/). Developing a general computational platform for the computational morphology from 3D digital data will allow evolutionary biologists to quantitatively and reproducibly address problems that provide greater insight into how ecological parameters might be, quite literally, 'shaping' biodiversity and thus has potentially profound implications for the field of evolutionary biology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe ability to characterize the physical traits (morphology) of an organism, called phenomics, is one major aspect of the field of evolutionary biology and complimentary to the study of the underlying genetic components (genomics).  Traditional phenomics involves taking measurements of organ dimensions or distances between key anatomical features (characters) of organisms and is necessarily quite limited in the extent to which geometric variations in an entire organism can be detected.  However, the advent of cutting edge digital imaging methods such as X-ray ComputedTomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the field by their ability to non-invasively acquire volumetric (i.e., 3-dimensional) digital representations (i.e., images) of the entire specimen. This provides the potential for vastly more complete characterizations of specimen morphology. However, reaching this potential requires overcoming two significant technical challenges: 1) Quantitatively characterizing the shape of a single 3D specimen (e.g., a skull) within a volumetric dataset and 2) Quantitatively characterizing the variations between multiple specimens.  Current approaches to these problems involve extracting surfaces (e.g., skull surface) from within these image volumes and fitting this surface to a general set of mathematical functions (called spherical harmonics) that can characterize surfaces, and then using rather primitive shape comparison analysis, such as Procrustes analysis, that performs scaling, rotation, and translation (essentially affine) transformations to compare the shapes.  The goal of the SAPID project was to develop new more general theoretical approaches, along with numerical implementations, to these problems that are more general.  As a result of this funding, we developed two novel approaches for achieving these goals.  First, we developed a method to characterize the shape of an entire volumetric object. This method, called the spherical wave decomposition (SWD), uses a very general mathematical description of waves in 3-dimensions to characterize 3D shapes. In addition, we developed a very fast algorithm to implement this theory.  It is capable of describing a volumetric shape from a large MRI dataset in approximately 10 sec.  Secondly, we developed a novel method for comparing the morphology of different specimens.  In general, comparison of different specimens (e.g., two skulls) requires registering them into a common coordinate system.  Since anatomical shapes are non-linearly related to one another (i.e., not describable by an affine transformation), this procedure is non-trivial.  The most sophisticated method for performing this task (though still not common in comparative computational morphology) are diffeomorphic transformations used in medical imaging research.  These methods are time consuming and error prone.  We developed a novel algorithm based on a symplectomorphic transformation (i.e., preserves the volume of phase space, thus allowing common metric and quantitive measurement of distances between shapes) that is both more accurate and faster than existing methods.  This method is called Symplectomorphic Registration using Entropy Spectrum Pathways (SYMREG-ESP).  Together, SWD and SYMREG-ESP provide the necessary computational tools to allow researchers to accurately and robustly perform computational morphology on complex 3D digital specimens, facilitating a truly accurate and robust set of applications by which to perform quantitative evolutionary biological  studies.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/27/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lawrence R Frank"
