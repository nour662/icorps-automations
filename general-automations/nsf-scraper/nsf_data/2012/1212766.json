 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developers and researchers at the Illinois Institute of Technology and Iowa State University are initiating an innovative approach to pre-K students' development of quantitative reasoning through measurement. This quantitative approach builds on measurement concepts and algebraic design of the pre-numeric stage of instruction found in the Elkonin-Davydov (E-D) elementary mathematics curriculum from Russia. The project team is adapting and refocusing the conceptual framework and learning tasks of the E-D pre-numeric stage for use with four-year-olds. The adaptation is being done in collaboration with experts in Russia who were involved in the original E-D development.  A primary goal of the project is to obtain a proof-of-concept and lay down a conceptual and empirical foundation for a subsequent research and development.\r\n\r\nThe research progresses using teaching experiments involving six students.  Each student is engaged in 15 minute one-on-one sessions twice each week.  Sessions are videotaped and transcribed for further analysis.  The analysis of the data is conducted by the project team in collaboration with Russian consultants.\r\n\r\nThe research findings and methodology will provide grounds for supporting more complex and sophisticated mathematical ideas that will inform curriculum development for pre-K students and teachers.  Results will be published and reported widely.",
