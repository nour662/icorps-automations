Advanced Li-ion battery technology will play a critical role in the realization of Hybrid Electric Vehicles, Electric Vehicles, and the increasingly critical field of renewable energy. Current solid-state Li-ion batteries have much lower energy and power densities than liquid electrolyte batteries due to the use of three different materials for the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte causing high interfacial resistance between the solid electrolyte and the solid electrodes. This project focuses on three primary research thrusts (1) To understand the formation mechanism of interface-free solid-state Li-ion batteries, (2) To explore the effect of interface properties on solid-state Li-ion batteries, and (3) To discover the relationship between electrochemical performance, material structure, and material composition of potential material for fabricating high temperature solid-state Li-ion batteries.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in exploring and overcoming the challenges associated with the electrode and electrolyte interfaces, which are the main contributing causes of the poor cycle life and low power density of current solid-state batteries. The elimination of such interfaces will enable the miniaturization of a solid-state Li-ion battery to a true nano-size power source, and allow Li-ion batteries to operate efficiently in high temperature environment due to their inherent safety merit. Understanding the relationship between performance and battery structure will enable strategic design of interface-free Li-ion batteries. \r\n\r\nThe success of this project will potentially lead to new Li-ion battery markets, and will have a profound impact on the electronic, automobile, and renewable energy industries. The proposed project will help train the scientific workforce for both academic communities and energy storage industries. This outreach will provide a broader horizon for academic success in a region well-poised to contribute to the diversity of the scientific workforce.",
