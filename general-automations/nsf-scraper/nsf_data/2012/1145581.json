 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical synapses within the brain are specialized cellular junctions that are vastly\r\nintergraded to allow for rapid, highly-specific communication between neurons. Fusion of\r\nneurotransmitter-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane, subsequent release and\r\nactivation of postsynaptic receptors executes a phase called exocytosis. To prevent the limited\r\nnumber of synaptic vesicles from rapid depletion, a secondary system of webbed pathways\r\nreplenishes the vesicle pool through several modes known as endocytosis. Although the exocytic\r\npathway, with its signaling cascade and key proteins are confidently defined, the true nature of\r\nvesicle re-formation is less clear. The proposed study will investigate the molecular mechanisms\r\nof endocytosis using biophysical and electrochemical methods with milli-second time resolution.\r\nWe expect that this work will illustrate the functions of several important endocytic proteins in\r\nendocytosis.\r\n\r\nThe results from this work will likely lead to important insights into synaptic vesicle\r\nrecycling, which is critical for higher functions of our brain, such as learning and memory. These\r\nresults will shed new light on a signaling cascade that defines the hallmark of inter-cellular\r\ncommunication and aid in identifying aspects of cellular health, thus revealing a deeper\r\nunderstanding of what functional mechanism(s) are involved in the dominant and most\r\nfundamental endocytic portal. The investigators will also be dedicated to the training of\r\nundergraduate and graduate students in scientific research, through discussion in classes and\r\nresearch in laboratories.",
