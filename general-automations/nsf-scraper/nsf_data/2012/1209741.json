 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Natalie Gumataotao of Loyola University Chicago to conduct a research project, entitled \"Investigation of metal-protein interactions during an industrial enzyme's synthesis,\" during the summer of 2012 at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan.  The host scientist is Dr. Masafumi Odaka.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to examine a metal transporting protein, or metallochaperone, involved in the maturation of the metalloenzyme thiocyanate hydrolase.  The structure of this metallochaperone suggests that the protein traffics metals differently from other well-characterized metallochaperones.  Metallochaperone research is a relatively new field with much left to be studied.  Understanding how essential metals are regulated in biological systems has many potential applications. \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Metal transport in biological systems is a tightly regulated process.  Understanding how essential metals are controlled, so that they are neither deficient nor in excess of the ideal quantities required for life, will give key insight into diseases or protein malfunctions resulting from errors in regulation.  Metal transporting proteins are responsible for ensuring the proper allocation of metals in a system.\n\n One such metal transporter is the protein P15K from the cobalt containing enzyme thiocyanate hydrolase (SCNase).  SCNase is used in industrial water treatment to degrade thiocyanates, a major component of wastewater that is known to cause health issues with prolonged exposure.  P15K is involved in the synthesis of SCNase and is necessary for a fully functional enzyme.  Prior research suggests that P15K traffics metal differently from other well-characterized metal transporting proteins. \n\n In the 10 weeks spent in Tokyo under the NSF-EAPSI program, the mode in which P15K transports cobalt in SCNase was studied under Dr. Masafumi Odaka of the Tokyo Institute of Agriculture and Technology.  Protein-protein interactions were probed using several different binding techniques.  The results of the experiments confirmed weak interactions of the different protein components and the cobalt ion.  We interpreted from the weak interactions that the P15K does indeed interact with the SCNase protein complex without driving the dissociation of one of the subunits, a step that may occur later in the maturation process.\n\n The NSF-EAPSI program gave me an opportunity to research in Japan in a much larger institution with much more equipment, laboratory space, and students than my home institution at Loyola University Chicago.  In a short time, I was able to learn four new techniques and apply them to my research in Japan and my research in Chicago.  Additionally, I was able to consult with Dr. Odaka, an expert in my field of research, on a daily basis.  As a result of the research accomplished this summer, our labs will be collaborating on future related projects. \n\n The cultural aspect of the program was invaluable for me.  I was able to experience Japan not as a tourist, but as a short-term resident.  In my free time from work, I visited several different cities of historical importance and experienced modern Japan.  Even working in the lab was a cultural experience.  The collectivist nature of Japanese people was a large contrast to American culture.  It was reflected in the work style, to which I adjusted accordingly.  My lab was also extremely limited in their English, which fostered a language exchange.  My Japanese has improved markedly.  I hope that I was able to help with my labmates' English.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Natalie I Gumataotao"
