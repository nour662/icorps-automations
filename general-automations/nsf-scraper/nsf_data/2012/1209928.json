 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Natural and man-made layered structures exhibit extremely high strength, toughness, thermal resistance, and biocompatibility characteristics. On the microscopic scale, lamellar layered structures are the basic foundation for the high strength and toughness of steel as a structural material. Structures in nature, such as mollusk shells, derive their high strength and toughness from a layered ceramic structure bonded together by an organic glue. Indeed, the structure of engineering materials often mimics the structures in nature. Multilayered materials at the nanoscale exhibit exciting possibilities for extremely high strength, fatigue resistance, thermal resistance, wear resistance, and biocompatibility. Thus, designing layered structures at the nanoscale is a particularly attractive strategy for developing a new generation of multifunctional materials with tremendous possibilities. Nanolaminate materials have very different properties from traditional bulk composites, due to their much higher interfacial area and dramatically smaller length scale. These changes can lead to new types of deformation mechanisms, which are very different from those observed in bulk systems. Fundamental research on the mechanical behavior of metal/ceramic multilayers at the nanoscale is necessary for successful implementation of these materials in engineering applications.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This international project focuses on the high temperature behavior of multilayered metal/ceramic materials. The collaborative project focuses on studying the fundamental science related to high temperature behavior and plasticity at small length scale, particularly under large constraint, load transfer to high stiffness ceramic layers, and a basic understanding of how nanostructure influences high temperature deformation. This project involves Prof. Nik Chawla and his research team at Arizona State University and Dr. Jon Molina-Aldareguia and his research group at the Madrid Institute for Advanced Studies of Materials (IMDEA) in the Polytechnic University of Madrid, Spain (where the Spanish effort is funded by the Spanish National Science Foundation). As well there are strong linkages to researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Cutting-edge techniques, such as high temperature nanoindentation, and in situ indentation in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) will be used. A new generation of graduate students are being trained through international experiences, and the development of course material is being shared in Spanish to attract students underrepresented in science and engineering.",
