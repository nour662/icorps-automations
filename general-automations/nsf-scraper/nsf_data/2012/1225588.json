 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Military Service and the Life Course\" \r\nMeredith Kleykamp, John R. Warren, Alair MacLean \r\n\r\nResearch on the correlates of military service has typically focused narrowly on particular historical periods (e.g., the Vietnam era) or on the experiences of particular cohorts (e.g., the World War II generation). Such designs preclude analysis of the ways in which veterans' outcomes are influenced by longer-term changes to major social institutions. \r\nThis project focuses on whether and how relationships between military service and a variety of outcomes \r\n(i.e., marriage, employment, education, and earnings) have changed as broader institutional changes have reshaped American society in the past half century. \r\n\r\nData are from the 1964-2012 Current Population Surveys (CPS) that will be significantly enhanced in two ways (as compared to currently existing public CPS data files): First, key measures will be harmonized over time. Second, records for individual veterans will be linked longitudinally across the full 16 months of their participation in the CPS. These uniquely rich data make it possible to address two specific empirical questions. First, how have differences between veterans and non-veterans changed over the past half century? Second, how have the correlates of specific military experiences, including serving in combat and having a service-related disability, changed in recent decades across the past half century? In both sets of analyses, four sets of outcomes are considered: marriage, education, employment, and earnings. No previous research has directly considered changes in veterans? outcomes across such an extensive array of cohorts and periods, or with a large enough sample to separately consider the experiences of female veterans or of veterans from ethno-racial minority groups. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Relatively little is known about the social and economic consequences of post-9/11 military service, especially as compared to the experiences of earlier generations. Indeed, Congress and the administration continue to express concern about the lack of research on how veterans of this era readjust to civilian life (Institute of Medicine 2010). In addition, veterans have long been the best (or worst) recruiters for the military. It is important that veterans are successful in their civilian roles after their periods of service in order to staff future all-volunteer forces.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this collaborative project, we use 1967-2013 Current Population Survey data to examine how differences in marriage, employment, earnings, and retirement between veterans and non-veterans changed over the past half century. We show that these relationships have varied across history.\n\nWe have presented five papers at professional conferences, wrote one chapter and contributed to another that will appear in a forthcoming edited book, and wrote one journal article that is also forthcoming, and contributed to one dissertation.  We continue to work on three journal articles to be submitted in the near future.\n\nA challenge of the project was to develop variables that allow us and future analysts to compare veterans to similar non-veterans on the basis of their historical experiences.  To compare those who served to those who did not, this measure had to be based on the year in which people were born, which determines the year that they would have first become eligible to serve in the military. We developed, tested, and compared three different versions of this variable.  We expect this conceptualization and comparison will be useful for future research that seeks to compare veterans to non-veterans across different cohorts.  This work contributed to a co-authored chapter titled \"Appendix A: Recommendations Regarding the Measurement of Periods of Military Service and Corresponding Age 18 Birth Cohorts\" that will appear in the edited volume Long-term outcomes of military service that is slated to appear in January 2016.  We also use this work to produce the project outcomes described below.\n\nWe use a variant of this measure to examine whether the general trends in increased income inequality in the United States have led to changes in inequality as experienced by veterans.  According to this work, veterans became more similar to non-veterans in terms of their earnings between 1979 and 2010, but more unequal from each other.  These changes may stem not just from period but also from cohort effects.  This research led to an article titled \"Income Inequality and the Military\" that will appear in The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science in January 2016.\n\nIn other work, we demonstrate that the chances that veterans would retire early relative to those chances among non-veterans has shifted over time, among men who became eligible to serve between the Second World War and the Vietnam era.  According to this research, men have become increasingly likely to remain in the labor force between the ages of 50 and 65.  Among the World War II cohort, veterans were less likely to retire early than were non-veterans.  Among the Vietnam era cohort, however, they were more likely to do so.  These findings were presented at an NIH R24 meeting and will be published a chapter titled \"Retirement Trends among  Male Veterans from World War II to Vietnam\" in the book Long-term outcomes of military service mentioned above.\n\nAccording to other work funded by this project, veterans appear better off than non-veterans in terms of their earnings, though their relative positions depend on age and cohort.  When they are younger, for example, they earn more than non-veterans if they are employed.  When they are in their mid-forties, non-veterans catch up to and surpass veterans in terms of their earnings.  In addition, veterans earned more than comparable non-veterans if they were eligible to serve in World War II or Korea, but less if they served in the Vietnam era and the early years of the all-volunteer force (1974-1990).  We have presented versions of these findings at two professional conferences and expect to submit this article for review to a journal in the near future.\n\nWe are currently preparing papers based on outcomes related to marital status. We have discovered that the relationship between such outcomes and veteran status appears to have shifted historically. Among cohorts who were eligible to serve through the Korean War,..."
