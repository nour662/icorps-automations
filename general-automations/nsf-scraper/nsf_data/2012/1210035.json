 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tepuis of South America are unique flat-topped mountains rising 3000m above the Guiana Shield. Many researchers believe the enormous species endemism found in tepuis is a result of millions of years of isolation atop summits. However, it is likely that the story is much more complex, involving recent dispersals and responses to climatic shifts. This project will investigate the role of isolated tepuis on diversification using two main approaches: (A) estimations of when species within a highland-restricted frog group diverged, to determine if they have been isolated atop summits since tepui formation (about 70 mya) or dispersed more recently; (B) estimation of population connectivity among three tepui summits, to determine the effect of tepui landscape on genetic parameters of two summit endemic species.\r\n\r\nBecause tepuis are some of the most drastic landscape features on earth, this study is a significant contribution to understanding the effects that drastic landscapes such as sky islands have on population connectivity, and thus on impacting levels of biodiversity. Additionally, this research will build partnerships with international scientists and train students in phylogenetics, population genetics, and biodiversity research.",
