 "awd_abstract_narration": "This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. \r\n\r\nThis funding establishes a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the Temple University focused on networking technologies. Students will participate in research projects that involve mobile computing, wireless communication, and cloud computing.  Each summer a cohort of undergraduate students will work with Temple faculty in small groups to design, implement, and evaluate a research project.  The students will participate in professional development activities that make them more aware of graduate school and professional aspects of a computing career. The students will have access to the WiMAX testbed that covers much of the metropolitan downtown area of Philadelphia.  Students will also have access to an internal supercomputer and a cloud cluster.  Thus the students will be able to use the outstanding facilities available at the university and work with the faculty at the Center of Networked Computing to conduct challenging and timely research using technologies that underpin next generation networks.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies with the strong research team and the focus on next generation networking technologies, an area of interest to students and a national priority. The students will work closely with faculty members on a research project that will be of interest to a wider research community and that has the potential for practical impact on everyday life. The research has the potential to contribute to the research core of the computing disciplines.\r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups and from institutions with limited research environments. Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.",
