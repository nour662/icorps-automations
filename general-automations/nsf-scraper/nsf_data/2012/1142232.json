 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of a\r\nsystem that allows for rapid detection and measurement of the concentration of metal ions in water with a\r\nview towards application of this system to monitoring water being released into environmental waters by\r\nindustrial companies. Companies discharging water into the environment maintain wastewater treatment\r\nfacilities, which frequently use chemicals to remove pollutants from wastewater. Controlling the\r\nefficiency of the treatment process requires real-time monitoring of the treated water. The proposed\r\nsystem will be capable of providing this capability, which will allow for optimum use of treatment\r\nchemicals ? currently treatment chemicals are used in excess to account for potentially large\r\nconcentration changes of the target pollutant to be removed. Thus, a real-time sensor system reduces both\r\nenvironmental impact and cost of treatment. The technology employs optical fibers, which are\r\nchemically modified with sensor molecules whose luminescence properties change in the presence of the\r\ntarget pollutant.\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are that this technology for real-time monitoring is not\r\nonly capable of meeting a critical need for real-time wastewater-treatment process control, but can\r\npotentially address a range of monitoring tasks requiring a robust, portable, and field-deployable\r\nmeasurement system while offering significant cost advantages compared to existing laboratory-based\r\nsystems. Thus, the impact of this project is beyond the initially targeted application to environmental\r\nmonitoring in general, exploiting the capability of the technology to accommodate sensors for a variety of\r\npollutants.",
