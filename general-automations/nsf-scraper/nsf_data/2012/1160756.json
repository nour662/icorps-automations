 "awd_abstract_narration": "****Technical Abstract****\r\nThe physics of hydrogen impurities in transparent conducting oxides, a rapidly emerging class of electronic materials, is the focus of this research program.  The transparent conducting oxides combine transparency in the visible with high conductivity.  Native defects such as oxygen vacancies and cation interstitials have traditionally been invoked as the source of conductivity.  Recent theory, however, finds that in many conducting oxides, native defects are unlikely to be responsible for their conductivity.  Instead, hydrogen centers are predicted to be shallow donors that give rise to strong n-type behavior.  While a number of exciting theoretical predictions have been made, a modern understanding of the conductivity of transparent conducting oxides and the role played by hydrogen is in its infancy.  IR and Raman spectroscopies will be used to probe the structures and reactions of H-related centers and their relationship to changes in conductivity. A central goal of this project is the education of students.  Experimental studies of impurities and defects in semiconducting oxides and their effect on conductivity provide an excellent opportunity for students to learn about the optical properties of materials, characterization methods, and how defects affect properties.  Students are engaged in collaborations with leading research groups in the U.S. and abroad and learn the value of teamwork by first-hand experience.\r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\nThe focus of this research program is an experimental study of hydrogen in transparent conducting oxides, an unusual class of materials that combine transparency in the visible with high conductivity.  Transparent conducting oxides are widely used in common electronic devices like flat-panel displays for computers.  The presence of hydrogen is common in the metal oxides where it forms strong O-H bonds and interacts with other impurities and defects.  Surprisingly, hydrogen is proposed to be an important source of conductivity.  The goal of this project is a fundamental understanding of the hydrogen impurity in conducting oxides, its fascinating reaction chemistry, and hydrogen's role as a source of conductivity. Research on strategic electronic materials, where interesting physics and important technological applications intersect, provides students with an excellent opportunity to learn about current developments in semiconductor technology, the optical properties of materials, the physics of semiconductors, and how defects affect properties. And the opportunity for a student to make important contributions to problems that have an impact on electronics technology ignites in him or her the excitement that leads to a successful career in science and engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectural Merit: Defects and impurities are responsible for the electronic properties of the semiconductor materials on which our modern electronics technologies are based.  Understanding the hydrogen impurity and its fundamental properties is vital in electronic materials.  Hydrogen is ubiquitous in the growth and processing environment and is introduced easily into semiconductors, intentionally or unintentionally.  Metal oxides are being investigated intensely for application as transparent conductors and as wide bandgap semiconductors.  The presence of hydrogen is common in oxides where it forms strong O-H bonds and, surprisingly, acts as an important source of conductivity.\n\nFlat panel displays and solar cells employ thin films of semiconducting oxides as conductive layers.  A heavily Sn-doped, indium-oxide (ITO) film made by sputtering has been the transparent oxide of choice.  Our research has investigated the end points of this system, SnO2 and In2O3, with high-quality single crystal specimens that have allowed us to make measurements of the microscopic properties of impurities in these materials that are not possible with thin films.\n\nIn our experiments, we have identified the specific hydrogen defects that give rise to conductivity in SnO2 and In2O3 and have investigated their stability and chemical reactions.  We have also used novel experimental methods based on infrared spectroscopy to determine the diffusivity of hydrogen in In2O3 over a broad range (Fig. 1).  Hydrogen in In2O3 is especially interesting because hydrogen-doped In2O3 attracts attention as an electrical contact material for solar cells with greater transparency that that of ITO.  The combination of our experimental results with complementary theory has determined detailed atomic-scale models for the defects we have discovered. \n\nBroader Imacts:  Our research is focused on problems in semiconducting materials that are important in technology.  The transparent conducting oxides promise exciting applications in electronic device engineering as transparent electrodes, in flat panel displays, as sensors, and as wide bandgap semiconductors.  This research program provides a highly successful strategy for the education of undergraduate and graduate students.  Every effort has been made to recruit students from under-represented groups (Fig.2) and to give them the opportunity to make important contributions to fundamental research that has an impact on technology.  This experience helps to ignite in students the excitement that will lead to successful careers in science.  Of the 23 students supported by the PI?s NSF-funded program since the year 2000, 16 (70%) of these students are women.  During the most recent contract period, we have successfully expanded our efforts to recruit minority students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael J Stavola"
