 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project proposes step-growth aliphatic polyesters that have tailorable thermal and mechanical properties.  The proposed liquid amorphous prepolymer approach is a versatile method for the production of degradable elastomeric materials. Control of thermal and solubility properties allows the team to tune the degradation rate, with complete degradation of a material in a period as little as thirty days. \r\n\r\nBiodegradable polymers are currently of great interest to both academia and industry. By further developing and pursuing the proposed technology, which utilizes common monomers, involves a relatively easy synthetic process, and results in a library of amorphous polymers with various properties and uniform degradation profiles, the proposed innovation can have a significant positive impact on both realms. The ability to tailor properties at low cost allows the team to design materials for specific applications and public needs. The team also identifies integrating their insights from the I-Corps program into various entrepreneurship initiatives at The University of North Carolina in order to further develop a spirit of entrepreneurship across the community.",
