 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reef-building corals are in decline worldwide due in part to climate change and other human activities, and it is becoming increasingly important to understand what aspects of coral biology are degraded by environmental stress which then leads to coral mortality. It is now widely known that corals harbor communities of bacteria and archaea that are believed to play important roles in maintaining the health of their hosts, but we lack any appreciable understanding about the identity of the microbial associates regularly residing within healthy, reef-building corals. This project asks the central question; do reef-building corals harbor fundamental or persistent microbial associates that are symbiotic within their tissues? In order to address this hypothesis, the investigator will assess the identity of the bacterial and archaeal microbes using a variety of molecular and microscopy approaches that includes the identification and localization of a widespread group of coral bacterial associates belonging to the genus Endozoicomonas. The results of this study will then be used to develop additional questions about the role of these microbial associates in nutrient cycling and how they contribute to the health and survival of corals. \r\n\r\nThis project will have a significant impact on our understanding of microbial associations in healthy, reef-building corals and support the development of a coral microbe database for the broader scientific community including coral scientists in countries with limited financial resources.  Both undergraduate students as well as local high school students will be trained in research techniques and mentored by the investigator and discoveries resulting from this project will be communicated to scientists and the public through open-access publications and news releases. The principal investigator will also engage with the public and K-12 students during outreach efforts on the importance of coral reefs to society.",

It is now widely known that corals harbor communities of bacteria and archaea that are believed to play important roles in maintaining the health of their hosts, but we lack any appreciable understanding about the identity of the microbes regularly associating with healthy, reef-building corals.\n\nThe goal of this work was to understand the extent to which reef-building corals harbor fundamental or persistent microbial associates that are symbiotic within their tissues as well as other coral-specific habitats.  Our study addressed this goal with direct studies of microbial associates in both Caribbean and Pacific corals as well as using previously collected and publically available data to examine the consistency of microbial associates across species and oceans.\n\nThis project made significant advances in addressing our goals.  For the direct studies, we developed a new approach to separate coral tissue and mucus and identified the most suitable DNA extraction method for these corals.  We demonstrated how differentiating between these coral habitats enabled the identification of previously unrecognized tissue and mucus associates of Caribbean corals, including 46 tissue- and 22 mucus-specific and consistent microbial members.  Importantly, sequences classifying as \"Candidatus Amoebophilus,\" Bacteroidetes-affiliated intracellular symbionts of amoebae, emerged as previously unrecognized tissue associates of three coral species. This is particularly important because it suggests that corals are  multi-symbiotic organisms, and adds a further degree of intricacy to  coral holobiont symbioses.

Our results demonstrate that when corals are present in the mesocosms, bacteria are preferentially removed via grazing. When corals were removed, their exudates enhanced the growth of diverse picoplankton. This work provides the first evidence of the multiple influences that corals have on reef picoplankton, which may play an important role in reef productivity.  During our analysis of sequence data in this study, we identified a critical problem with commonly utilized molecular primers that excluded an abundant group of marine bacteria (SAR11).  Our re-design and improvement of the primers resulted in an important contribution to the ocean microbiome community.\n\nOur examination of coral microbial diversity using publically available data has demonstrated that corals harbor one of the most biodiverse microbiomes on Earth, spanning 37 described and candidate phyla of Bacteria and two phyla of Archaea.  A number of specific taxonomic groups were also found to be prominent and less-recognized.  We constructed two coral microbial sequence databases that house different types of sequence data.  These databases as well as the other new sequence data produced during this project are important resources for the scientific community. \nThis project has produced new sequence and supporting oceanographic data which have been shared publically through BCO-DMO.  Project data are available at the following url: http://www.bco-dmo.org/project/564442.
