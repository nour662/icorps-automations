 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU is a collaborative effort between Clemson University and Spelman College. Undergraduate students who have a solid background in mathematics are invited to apply for an eight-week research experience in computational algebraic geometry, number theory and combinatorics to be held at Clemson University.  Preference for up to four of these positions will be given to qualified applicants who have roots in the Southeastern United States.  In addition, two of the participants will be undergraduates from Spelman College.  The participants will be offered up to $500 in travel support, a dorm room to be shared with other participants in the REU, up to $800 for meals and a stipend of $3,400 in return for their participation in this program.\r\n\r\nParticipants will be introduced to various tools, techniques and problems from computational algebraic geometry, number theory, and combinatorics.  Faculty will present several potential research problems the first week of the REU. The participants will divide themselves into teams of two to four participants and pick one of the problems presented on which to focus for the remainder of the REU.  The goal of the program is to help students attain a higher level of independence in mathematical research by giving them the opportunity to take part in a significant and interesting research project.   Guidance will be provided on giving effective presentations, applying to graduate schools, and other topics of interest to the participants.  The teams will write up a final report summarizing their research findings before leaving the program.  They will also be encouraged to publish papers based upon their work when appropriate.  Students will be encouraged to attend appropriate conferences and present their work. In addition to the faculty research mentors, our program provides vertical integration as graduate students will help mentor the undergraduate students. As a complement to working on their research, students will attend a weekly lecture series.  These lectures will be given by faculty that been recognized as leaders in the various fields related to the students' research problems and who have demonstrated the ability to clearly communicate mathematical ideas to audiences of varying levels of mathematical maturity.",
