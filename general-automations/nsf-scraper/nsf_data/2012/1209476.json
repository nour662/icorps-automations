 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Anna Herring of Oregon State University to conduct a research project, entitled \"How the chemistry of rock surfaces affects trapping of carbon dioxide\" during the summer of 2012 at Australia National University in Canberra, Australia. The host scientist is Adrian Sheppard.\r\n\r\nThis research extends knowledge of multiphase fluid flow and capillary trapping, specifically in application to geologic sequestration of supercritical carbon dioxide. It examines and quantifies the effect of modifying wettability on capillary trapping of various fluids within Bentheimer sandstone cores.  The results will guide efforts to engineer carbon dioxide injection scenarios to optimize trapping, which is crucial for the success of geologic sequestration projects. In addition, better understanding of the physics involved in multi-phase flow in porous media is not only necessary for optimization of geologic carbon dioxide sequestration but can be applied to many other fields of research, e.g. groundwater hydraulics, remediation of non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) in the subsurface, and oil recovery operations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
