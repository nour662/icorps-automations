 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continued funding for a 3D High Definition (HD) video documentary about an international group of earth scientists engaged in an investigation of the processes responsible for central Mongolia's unusually active uplifting terrain (the Hangay Dome) and its consequences for regional climate patterns and ecosystems (EAR -1009702).  The Hangay Dome in central Mongolia provides an excellent and accessible laboratory to investigate these processes and determine the degree to which mantle upwelling, mafic underplating, lithospheric foundering or plume activity have been important agents in its uplift.\r\n\r\nThe research project as a whole will be the focus of a feature-length documentary film (Mongolia 3D) aimed at Earth-science education and public outreach, and primary and interpreted project data will be available on the web for use in classrooms at various levels. The 3D video format is a new immersive television medium that has emerged from the highly successful 3D feature film format, and Mongolia 3D will be among the pioneering documentary productions fully produced, from inception to delivery, in 3D.",

This award continued the production of a 3D and 2D documentary about  international collaborations of earth scientists engaged in cutting-edge  research in Asia.

The researchers were filmed working in the countries of Mongolia, Nepal, and the U.S.  In Mongolia researchers were probing the reasons behind central Mongolia&rsquo;s unusually active, rising terrain and its consequences for regional climate patterns and ecosystems; in Nepal they were pinpointing seismic hazards and learning more of the uplift of the Himalayas; in the U.S. they were analzing rock samples in state-of-the-art laboratories.  The planned documentary--to be crafted for public audiences under a future project--is intended for a primary audience of television viewers watching PBS and international stations and a 3D-television channel; the film&rsquo;s secondary audience will be visitors to a 3D exhibit or screenings in science museums and other public venues.  The documentary will also include footage from a separate project filmed in Bangladesh, where researchers were studying dangerous seismic hazards as well the effects of climate change on millions of people in this vulnerable, low-lying country.
