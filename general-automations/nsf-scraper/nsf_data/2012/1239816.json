As an open source project, it has a wide-spread and disparate community of developers and users. Bringing members of this community together for a yearly conference helps to build a strong cohesion of ideas and identify and define the goals of the project. This conference also addresses the issues of increasing the development community of the project by getting to know potential developers and educating them on structure, style, and etiquette of a large, world-wide project used by thousands of people.",
