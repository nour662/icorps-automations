Ford\tDepartment of Chemical Engineering, University of Virginia\r\nBrian D. Wood \tSchool of Chemical, Biological, and Environmental Engineering, Oregon State University\r\n\r\nChemotaxis is the ability of motile bacteria to sense chemical concentration gradients in their local surroundings and swim toward higher concentrations of pollutants that they degrade. In the subsurface, \r\nbioremediation is often hindered by the inability to achieve good mixing between injected substances and \r\nthe resident contaminants. In such situations, chemotaxis might be exploited to enhance the mixing of \r\nbacterial populations within contaminated zones. The goal of this study is to connect direct experimental measurement of chemotaxis in physically and chemically heterogeneous porous media with appropriate mechanistic descriptive theory. Two main hypotheses will be used to organize the research effort. They will combine both (a) multiscale experimental observations, and (b) a multiscale upscaling analysis to develop a theoretical framework that can describe chemotaxis in chemically and physically heterogenous media at microscopic and macroscopic scales. The first hypotheses is that in porous media with trapped sources of nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) pollutants, chemotactic bacteria will have measurably slower transport than non-chemotactic bacteria.  In particular, chemotactic bacteria will exhibit greater retardation and tailing than will non-chemotactic mutants because of selective trapping of chemotactic bacteria at the fluid-NAPL interfaces. The second hypothesis is that transport of bacteria under chemotactic versus non-chemotactic conditions are dramatically different in the presence of large-scale heterogeneities.  Although chemotaxis is inherently a pore-scale process, the net influence of chemotactic bacteria on transport from high to low conductivity regions of a heterogeneous medium will be experimentally measurable, and will have relevance to bacterial transport in the field. This project will combine innovative experimental designs for data collection and upscaling to develop multiscale models for chemotaxis. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this research is to develop an understanding of the macroscopic scale (bulk) transport behavior of chemotaxis in porous media.  This necessarily involves linking the macroscale transport to the essential microscale features of the system that control chemotaxis. Improvements in the ability to measure phenomena at small scales has lead to experimental data sets that contain detail that was nearly unimaginable even a decade ago. The development of such extraordinary data sets has also frequently promulgated the question ?how does one make sense of these data? Is there a way to search for essential features of behavior in them?? New archetypes for data analysis (e.g., machine learning algorithms, data mining) have been employed as methods to assess such data sets. When applied to the problem of large data sets arising from physical systems, upscaling methods are among these data analysis archetypes. Outcomes from this proposal will result in more robust models for predicting microbial transport in groundwater systems, which will lead to improved design and implementation of bioremediation schemes.",

One potential threat to our underground water supply is the accidental release of oily substances from chemical spills, which seep into the soil and contaminate these natural aquifers. Contamination may also occur because of leaking gasoline storage tanks that are buried underground. These scenarios are particularly challenging to remediate because the contamination spreads out underground and the full extent of it may be difficult to assess. Furthermore, droplets of oil may become trapped within the interstices of the soil matrix that are less accessible to groundwater flow. Thus, conventional pump-and-treat remediation processes that rely on flushing water through the soil may leave behind residual oil droplets that continue to slowly release chemicals into groundwater after the treatment process is terminated.<br /><br />Bacteria that exist naturally in the soil are able to breakdown chemical pollutants into byproducts that are beneficial to the bacteria and non-toxic to humans. We are particularly interested in species of bacteria that also exhibit a behavior known as chemotaxis; we describe chemotaxis as a sense of smell that enables bacteria to locate and swim toward sources of food (e.g. chemical pollutants) in their surroundings. Our goal is to exploit this chemotactic behavior to remove the pollutants in a way that reduces exposure, cost and disruption to the natural environment. To determine if this is feasible we need to know if the natural processes for biodegradation and chemotaxis are fast enough to prevent to the spread of contamination to local drinking water sources.<br /><br /><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong><br />Our objective was to describe the chemotactic response using mathematical equations that predict how the bacteria will migrate toward the droplets of oil that are difficult to flush out of the aquifer.<br /><br />We developed experimental tools that allowed us to isolate certain processes and control the variables that are important in groundwater remediation processes such as features of the soil structure and the water flow rate. Chemotactic bacteria were able to swim toward chemical contaminants that were trapped within the soil matrix while nonchemotactic bacteria were carried along by the groundwater flow (Fig 1). We also observed that chemotactic bacteria were retained to a greater extent within less permeable regions that contained oil droplets than nonchemotactic bacteria using the microfluidic device in Fig 2. As we increased the flow rate beyond values that are typical for groundwater in aquifers, the impact of chemotaxis was diminished because of the force of the groundwater current. <br /><br />As part of this collaborative project with researchers at Oregon State University we developed mathematical tools that relate microscopic observations of individual chemotactic bacteria to large-scale predictions of how bacterial populations migrate through contaminated soil. Mathematical models also enabled us to visualize the distribution of bacteria inside the column (Figure 3 B, C) and sand box (Figure 4 B, C, D). These kind of data would have been much more difficult to obtain experimentally. <br /><br /><strong>Outcomes</strong><br />What we learned is that the chemotactic response spreads out the bacterial population to a greater extent than nonchemotactic species making it more likely for them to encounter residual oil that is trapped in the soil. Once they are near the oil they are also retained there for a longer period of time. This is important because the rate at which the contaminant is degraded increases proportionally with the number of bacteria that have access to it.<br /><br />We measured properties to quantify the chemotactic response that are intrinsic, which means they do not depend on the details of the particular experimental system that we used to collect the data (because our model was able to take all those details into account) and can therefore be used to predict outcomes under different experimental scenarios and ultimately in the natural environment.<br /><br />Outcomes from this project will improve the modeling and analysis tools that are needed for policy decisions related to environmental remediation and restoration. Chemotaxis properties measured from microfluidic devices (Fig 2), sand-packed columns (Fig 3A) and laboratory-scale systems (Fig 4A) will be used in mathematical models to evaluate technology for bioremediation of contaminated groundwater. In some cases, understanding the effect of chemotaxis on the migration of bacteria may impact the decision as to whether natural processes are sufficient to contain and abate the source of contamination or if more invasive technologies are necessary.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/16/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Roseanne&nbsp;M&nbsp;Ford</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141400/1141400_10151025_1526485149324_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141400/1141400_10151025_1526485149324_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bacteria in the vicinity of an oily contaminant trapped between grains of soil\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141400/1141400_10151025_1526485149324_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bacteria in the vicinity of an oily contaminant trapped between grains of soil\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Chemotactic bacteria (red) direct their swimming motion toward the contaminant source and are retained for a longer period of time in the vicinity of the oil.
