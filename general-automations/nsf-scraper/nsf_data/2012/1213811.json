 "awd_abstract_narration": "Benjamin McCall of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaig, is supported by an award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program in the Chemistry division to implement two complementary experiments to study the high-resolution infrared spectrum of CH5+.  This ion is the prototypical carbonium ion of the type so successfully used by George Olah and colleagues for superacid chemistry, and is also a critical intermediate in interstellar chemistry.  A high-resolution ro-vibrational spectrum consisting of nearly 1000 lines was obtained over a decade ago, and remains completely unassigned.   The first experiment aims to record the CH5+ spectrum at room temperature with sub-MHz precision and accuracy using cavity-enhanced velocity modulation spectroscopy, to enable the first experimental determination of ground-state energy level spacings using the method of four-line combination differences.  Our second experiment aims to record the CH5+ spectrum using a novel fast ion beam spectrometer fed by a continuous supersonic expansion discharge source, to provide the first unambiguous, high-precision spectrum of CH5+ at low temperature; this in turn enables the experimental determination of the energies of the lowest rotational energy levels of CH5+. \r\n\r\nTaken together, these experiments should provide the first understanding of the ro-vibrational structure of this enigmatic molecule, and enable McCall and coworkers to construct an energy level diagram of the ground vibrational state of this ion for the first time.  Ultimately, this new understanding should also enable the radio-astronomical detection of this important ion in dense interstellar clouds.  This research, and associated activities, can be expected to have a broad impact in terms of enhancing interdisciplinary research, training undergraduate and graduate students, and integrating teaching and research.  The overarching theme of  these efforts is to bring together the chemistry, astronomy, and physics communities, and to encourage cross-fertilization between these three disciplines.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the period of this award, the McCall laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign developed and refined a new instrument that enables detailed studies of the properties of positively charged molecules in the gas phase.  \n\nPositively charged molecules (\"molecular ions\") are created in a plasma similar to a neon sign, except that the plasma changes direction 40,000 times per second, so that the ions are wiggled back and forth periodically.  A laser in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum is then injected into an \"optical cavity\" formed by two highly reflective mirrors, one placed on either side of the plasma.  The laser bounces back and forth between the mirrors many times, allowing more opportunities for the laser to interact with the molecular ions in the plasma.  Before being sent into the cavity, the laser light is modified using \"heterodyne modulation\" much like an FM radio.  When the laser light exits the cavity, it is imaged onto a detector that converts the intensity of the light into an electrical signal.  This signal is then fed through sophisticated electronics that first \"demodulate\" the heterodyne signal, and then \"demodulate\" it again at the frequency of the plasma; this combination of demodulations allows the system to reject various sources of noise in the laser light.\n\nBecause of their quantum mechanical nature, molecular ions absorb (or emit) characteristic colors of light.  A similar effect is responsible for the unique color of sodium vapor lights and neon signs.  As we scan the color of the laser, we can record the absorptions of the molecular ions in our plasma.  Our aim is to measure the colors (or wavelengths, or equivalently frequencies) of these absorptions with very high precision and accuracy.  The technique we have developed with NSF support has enabled us to measure these absorption signals with a precision of about one part in a hundred million.  To put this in context, this is roughly equivalent to measuring the diameter of the Earth to within 4 inches.\n\nThere are two major applications for this type of high-precision measurements of molecular ions.  The first is to facilitate the fundamental understanding of the quantum mechanical properties of molecular ions.  For example, the major target our experiment has been aiming to study is called \"protonated methane\" and has the chemical formula CH5+. This happens to be a very unusual molecule (since carbon usually only can bond to four atoms, whereas in this molecule it bonds to five!); our high-precision measurements will ultimately help chemists to understand the structure and interal motions of this mysterious molecule.\n\nThe second major application of our high-precision measurements is to enable the detection of molecular ions in clouds of gas and dust that lie between the stars in our galaxy (so-called \"interstellar clouds\").  The chemical composition of these clouds can be studied using spectrometers on telescopes, but those measurements can only identify molecules if those molecules have first been studied in the laboratory by systems such as ours.\n\nIn addition to these scientific impacts from the development of our new instrument, there have also been impacts in the training of students.  Over the course of this award, ten graduate students and four undergraduate students have had the opportunity to learn about many aspects of experimental science, and this has prepared them to pursue careers in a variety of areas including national security analysis, the chemical industry, and science teaching.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/04/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin J Mccall"
