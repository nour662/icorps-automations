 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program is located at the Duke University Marine Laboratory (DUML), Piver's Island, NC. The award supports a three-year program that will provide eight student internships each summer for a 10-week research experience at DUML.  The PI will recruit students nationally and at Elizabeth City State, Savannah State University (SSU) and the 34 schools (mainly non-PhD granting institutions) that are affiliated with the Marine Laboratory in the Marine Sciences Educational Consortium. Students will live in Marine Laboratory dormitories and take their meals in the dining hall. Students will have a choice of ten advisors in the general research areas of (1) sensory physiology and behavior, (2) environmental toxicology, (3) molecular biology and genetics, and (4) coastal and estuarine processes. Co-curricular activities include a Marine Laboratory-sponsored seminar program, participation in selected field trips and water related recreational activities. At the end of the summer, REU students present their results during a student research symposium, and they prepare a scientific manuscript on their research. Support provided by NSF includes funding for student stipends, student travel to and from the site, student housing and meals and some administrative costs.",
