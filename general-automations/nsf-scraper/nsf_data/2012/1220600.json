 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean acidification by anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere will ultimately be balanced by sedimentary carbonate dissolution. The time constant for this reaction, however, is ca. 6,000 years. So, in the coming decades, the ocean's response to CO2 uptake will be based on the kinetics of supply and removal, not on the thermodynamics of the system. Unfortunately our understanding of the basic rate law for carbonate dissolution in the ocean is lacking. The order of the rate law is still argued to be anywhere from 1 to 4.5; this range represents a major difference in the sensitivity of the system to small changes in saturation state. The relative importance of aragonite vs. calcite dissolution, the influence of magnesium content in the minerals, and the sign of the role of organic matter are all still unknowns in the modern ocean. Of course, a truly useful rate law would be able to combine the relative importance of all of these factors into a predictive rule for how dissolution will respond to ocean acidification. \r\n\r\nIn this study, researchers at the California Institute of Technology and the University of Southern California will address this problem with a novel set of laboratory and in situ experiments that use carbon-13 (13C) tracer labeled biogenic carbonates to measure the dissolution rate under a wide range of saturation states.  They will assemble a set of rules that will govern carbonate dissolution in sinking particles and in marine sediments. This will require two sub-projects. First, they will culture several different species of biogenic carbonate producers in the lab under the influence of a strong 13C label. With enrichments of around 30,000o/oo in the calcium carbonate (CaCO3), they will measure the change in dissolved inorganic carbon-13 at several time points over 1-2 weeks in specially built high-pressure reaction chambers. The construction of a prototype chamber is completed and it provides the means, for the first time, to control carbonate saturation state by changing seawater chemistry, pressure, and temperature independently. Experiments with pure 13C labeled inorganic CaCO3 will provide the inorganic reference frame for the biogenic carbonate results. Secondly, to check the lab-based rate data, they will also use labeled biogenic particles in a simple Niskin bottle based reactor that will be deployable on regular hydrowire. The accumulation of 13C in the Niskin dissolved inorganic carbon over 1-2 days will provide an initial rate that is directly comparable to the more extensive laboratory study on the same sorts of materials. Using the San Pedro Basin as a test bed for these in situ experiments will sample a range of saturation states in a series of 3-day cruises.  This high-sensitivity approach should allow the team to unpack the various components of carbonate dissolution in seawater under rising CO2 concentrations. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. Producing a better rate law for carbonate dissolution will have broad implications for the fields of marine chemistry, marine biology, paleoceanography, and for potential societal response to ocean acidification. This rate law sits at the heart of the marine carbonate cycle. In addition, this work will benefit at least two graduate students and promote US-Israel collaborations via the inclusion of Jonathan Erez and his students. The specific involvement of underrepresented high school students in scientific/oceanographic research is built into the efforts of this project as well as ongoing efforts by both PIs to communicate their science to a broad array of non-scientific audiences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe have developed a new technique for measuring the dissolution rate of calcium carbonate in seawater under a wide variety of aqueous conditions.  Our method uses highly 13C labeled solids and monitors the appearance of 13C atoms in the solution.  In this way we are directly measuring the rate of mass loss.  Inorganic calcite has a strongly non-linear dependence of dissolution rate on the degree of undersaturation.  This curved behavior means that there are multiple mechanisms working at the solid-solution interface and the dominant one changes with the thermodynamic state of the system.  We discovered that the enzyme Carbonic Anhydrase catalyzes the dissolution of calcite at all pH values, including those lower than the normal range for seawater.  This result implies that carbonic acid is directly attacking the calcite surface and that we need to rethink the rate law for carbonate dissolution in seawater which currently only includes the activity of calcium and carbonate ions.\n\nGiven our new, very sensitive, reactor for monitoring the progress of carbonate dissolution, we have begun to explore the rate\u00c6s dependence on pressure and temperature as well as testing other carbonate materials.  There is a strong increase in rate with increasing pressure that goes beyond the effect of pressure on the saturation value alone.  Temperature experiments are ongoing, but we see a clear increase in rate with higher temperature and potentially different activation energies at different temperatures.  We have also cultured planktonic and benthic foraminifera, cocoliths, and soft corals in the presence of 13C to then use the resulting shells in our reactor.  At pH values close to equilibrium cocoliths behave the same as inorganic calcite.  However, beyond a critical saturation value the biogenic materials are slower to dissolve than calcite, on a per area basis.  Bleached and unbleached cocoliths show the same rate dependence on saturation and foraminifera lie between cocoliths and inorganic calcite.\n\nOur discovery of catalysis by carbonic anhydrase puts safe and efficient storage of human CO2 emissions in seawater back on the table as a viable climate mitigation solution.  By reacting limestone at the surface of the earth, rather than at the bottom of the ocean where it will happen naturally, we can bypass many of the slow steps in the earth\u00c6s natural process that will take up anthropogenic CO2.  Given that we can also make the reaction of CO2 and limestone go nearly 1,000 times faster with the catalyst, a series of factories that processed limestone in seawater could greatly mitigate anthropogenic CO2 without changing the ocean\u00c6s pH, pCO2 or carbonate ion concentration.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/18/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jess F Adkins"
