 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Matthew B. Kleban at New York University.\r\n \r\nNew data from cosmology have quantified many parameters of our universe to unprecedented accuracy. Among the most significant is the determination that much of the energy in the universe is \"dark\", of a form consistent with a small, positive vacuum energy. Such a result is famously difficult to explain, and accounting for it probably requires a theory of quantum gravity. Professor Kleban will advance his ongoing program of research in fundamental physics, with a focus on those aspects of string theory and quantum gravity that predict effects which can be tested with cosmology. Professor Kleban's recent work helped lay the foundation for understanding the effects of high-scale physics on cosmology, particularly signatures of cosmic bubble collisions, and in a recent development, an independent group recently analyzed Cosmic Microwave Background data for the signals of bubble collisions which were predicted by the Prof. Kleban.  This search uncovered several anomalous features consistent with collisions, but the results were incomplete and inconclusive.  Determining the origin of those anomalies is of paramount importance, and Prof. Kleban will pursue this along with a number of other related research directions. \r\n\r\nThis work is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  The detection of a cosmic bubble collision would be a transformative discovery, permanently altering our understanding of the universe and humanity's place within it.  It would demonstrate that our observable universe is a tiny part of a vastly larger multiverse populated by other bubbles containing regions of highly exotic physics.  It would also confirm a prediction of string theory, provide crucial evidence for the nature of dark energy, and dramatically change our view of the Big Bang. This possibility continues to have a substantial broader impact in the form of magazine and newspaper articles, public lectures and interviews given by Prof. Kleban, and by inspiring undergraduate and graduate physics students at NYU.  On another front, Prof. Kleban recently helped develop a survey that was administered to hundreds of NYU undergraduates, with the aim of determining if and why minority and women students drop out of the physics program at a higher rate than others.  As part of his continuing research, he will continue the analysis of the results of this survey with the goal of using the conclusions to help improve the graduation and success rates of women and minority physics students.  Finally, Prof. Kleban will train and aid in the professional development of graduate students that participate in this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project supported the PI, Matthew Kleban, together with several postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, in pursuing a program of research at the interface between high-energy particle physics, string theory, cosmology, and quantum gravity.\n\nCosmology is the study of the very large - the biggest structures in the universe and their evolution over billions of years.  Particle physics and string theory is the study of the very small - the fundamental, microscopic constituents of matter.  The connection between the two stems from the fact that the universe is expanding, and the early universe, shortly after the big bang, was extremely hot, dense, and small.  \n\nA central question in cosmology is why the universe is so large, so smooth, and so homogeneous.  The leading theory to explain these observational facts is known as cosmic inflation.  According to the theory of inflation, the universe expanded very rapdily and by an enormous amount in the tiny fraction of a second just after the big bang.  \n\nThe observational evidence for inflation is compelling, but we do now know what was responsible for this explosive growth.  Whatever it was, it took place at a very high energy scale, when quantum effects and gravity both played a crucial role.  \n\nAnother fundamental unsolved mystery is the cosmological constant problem.  In the late 1990s osmologists discovered that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating - that the universe is expanding faster and faster with time.  In roughly another 10 billion years, the universe will be expanding twice as rapidly as it is now.  This is bizarre: gravity is an attractive force that tends to pull things together, slowing the expansion.  However it can be explained if there is some energy associated to the vacuum, to empty space.  The cosmological constant problem is to explain the nature and origin of this dark energy, and why it is so small, as quantum physics predicts that its typical or natural value vastly exceeds what is experimentally observed.\n\nA major result of this project was to connect these two fundamental mysteries - the origin of inflation and the nature of dark energy.  Along with his postdocs and students and with the support of this project, the PI discovered a novel mechanism by which inflation can occur.  This mechanism involves the so-called \"string theory landscape\".  The extra spatial dimensions predicted by string theory can be curled up so tightly as to be impossible to observe with earth-based experiments.  However the different possible configurations of these dimensions - of which there are very many - give rise to varying values of the vacuum energy.  Most of these values are much to large to match observations of dark energy, but perhaps could be suitable to power the explosive expansion of early universe inflation.  In unwinding inflation, the large vacuum energy in a typical geometric phase decays, \"unwinding\" and producing the period of early-universe expansion we infer from cosmological data.  This reduces the vacuum energy down to a smaller value that could be consistent with current observations.  This mechanism, if correct, produces characteristic patterns during inflation that may be observable today in the cosmic microwave background, and in the structure of galaxies and clusters of galaxies.\n\nThis discovery and the investigations of its features and implications, along with the study of a number of other aspects of the theory of inflation, constituted the majority of the work on this grant.  Among other results, the PI largely eliminated the so-called \"initial conditions problem\" of chaotic inflation, showing both numerically and analytically that, contrary to the standard lore in the field, inflation can begin even if the initial conditions are extremely inhomogeneous.  Another notable result was the discovery of a novel class of conformal field theories based on a statistical ensemble known as the \"Brownian loop soup\".  Conformal field theories have many applications and are of intrinsic interest, and these appear to be entirely novel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew Kleban"
