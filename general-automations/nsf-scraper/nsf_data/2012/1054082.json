The instrument will support NSF funded research on the effects of mountain glacier retreat proximal to the Gulf Alaska on hydrologic processes and ecosystem biogeochemical cycling across the cryosphere ? marine interface with a focus on stream processes in the wake of retreating glaciers.  Recent climate warming in this region is dramatically altering local ecosystems as land is freshly exposed to atmospheric, hydrologic and biosphere activity.  The effects of these processes have significant implications for important marine and freshwater fisheries, for sea level change and for the transport and fate of atmospheric aerosols.  The LCOS will be particularly useful for determining the relative contribution of glacial melt waters to local streams.  The PIs plan to engage in related K-12 outreach through an established summer short course series.  The University of Alaska Southeast (UAS) in Juneau hosts a high percentage of Native Alaskans and UAS is an undergraduate institution.  The potential impact for training underrepresented students in modern geochemical analysis method as applied to local environmental issues is high.  \r\n\r\n***",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award from the Earth Science Instrumentation Program at NSF enabled Environmental Science Faculty at the University of Alaska Southeast (UAS) to purchase a water isotope analyzer for our multi-disciplinary Natural Science Research Lab.  This is the first isotope analyzer of its kind in southeast Alaska, a region that is characterized by rapidly changing terrestrial and near-shore marine ecosystems as a result of the ongoing loss of glacier ice in the Coast Mountains. The isotope analyzer has greatly increased research capacity at UAS in the area of physical hydrology.  In particular, because glacier melt has a relatively unique isotopic signature, the analyzer has increased our ability to fingerprint streamwater derived from melting glaciers as opposed to streamwater derived from other watershed sources such as rainfall and groundwater.  As an example, our research from the summer of 2012 demonstrated that the isotopic signature of streamwater across different coastal watersheds in the region is closely correlated with a host of water quality parameters, including nutrient concentrations.  This information is useful because it will allow us to use water isotope measurements to better predict how water quality will change in the future as glaciers continue to shrink and contribute less to stream flow.\n\nThe water isotope analyzer is also being used for training and outreach purposes.  It has supported the research of an NSF-funded postdoctoral researcher and has also been used by an undergraduate and a high school student working on independent research projects in our lab.  In addition, the analyzer was used by UAS students in an undergraduate Hydrology class in the Fall of 2012 to explore the sources of water in different coastal watersheds.  Finally, the capacity to analyze water isotopes at UAS is leading to new regional research collaborations for UAS faculty with researchers at the U.S. Forest Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Juneau, Alaska.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eran Hood"
