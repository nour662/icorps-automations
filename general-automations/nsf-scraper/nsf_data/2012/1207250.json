The project has three major objectives that include assessing the attentiveness of recent ADVANCE programs to issues germane to women of color, examining the rationale of those strategies utilized in addressing the underrepresentation of women of color and identifying successful practices and strategies that have been successfully implemented in the ADVANCE program.  This project, which represents the first systematic exploration of the ADVANCE program and its focus on women of color will combine a pilot study, funded proposal content analysis and interviews with funded ADVANCE project personnel.  It is expected that the outcomes of this effort will support the ADVANCE program in promoting inclusiveness as it relates to gender equity.",
