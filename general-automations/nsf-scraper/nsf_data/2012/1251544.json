 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will perform an in-depth study on the development of a framework for a cyberinfrastructure (CI) general practitioner education and internship program targeted at creating highly-capable and innovative information technology (IT) professionals. This project will establish a methodology by which to develop a prototype model that implements an applied internship program within an academic setting. This methodology will include evaluating both undergraduate and graduate curriculum content needs, exploring a set of desired practical workforce competencies, forging the appropriate mix of private sector partnerships, conducting a fit/gap analysis of current curriculum offerings, and developing the prototype offering of a CI general practitioner program that explores an internship style model for instructional delivery. \r\n\r\nThe United States faces several challenges in addressing the necessary aptitudes that future information technology professionals will need. Traditional computer science and computer engineering degrees tend to focus only on theoretical foundations of computing, and these programs often lack the time to guide the students through a comprehensive apprenticeship program. Curriculum development programs that focus only on undergraduate education miss the large population of knowledgeable graduate-level student researchers who are often well prepared to employ practical cyberinfrastructure (CI) skills in advancing their research and teaching activities. A standardized educational model that enables both undergraduate and graduate students to gain much needed extracurricular CI skills does not exist. In addressing these challenges, this program will investigate the feasibility and needed components of a CI Practitioner program, which seeks to bridge the applied skills gaps between training programs currently offered by technical colleges, traditional university degree programs, and professional certification pathways in order to begin creating a workforce that possesses the theoretical foundation, hands-on capabilities, and technical skills needed to engage in and support CI-enabled science and innovation. The results of this study will be applicable at all institutions working toward a more relevant and more effective curriculum and internship program for preparing undergraduate or graduate students to become innovative and competitive in the technology driven global market. This project?s discoveries and curriculum model will be applicable within multiple disciplines, as CI benefit has no boundaries.  Beneficiaries of this work will include traditional CI-enabled sciences primarily, but also the humanities and economic endeavors.  Finally, this program will foster innovation and independence in CI management and development by providing participating undergraduate and graduate students with the critical broad perspective of CI needed to make the best decisions and best use of available resources.",
