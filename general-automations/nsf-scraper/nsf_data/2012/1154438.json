The workforce needs of these industries are targeted by Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, which is preparing 125 academically talented but financially needy STEM majors for job placement or transfer to STEM programs at baccalaureate institutions.  Potential students from underrepresented groups are recruited for enrollment.  STEM majors are supported through an early alert system and team building initiative to improve their success and program completion.  Students enrolled through this STEM initiative are also given leadership training and opportunities to connect with industry leaders and enroll in university-parallel programs that ensure their ability to meet articulation agreements for seamless transfer.",

Additional project outcomes include more than 95% of GC-Scholars have successfully completed their corresponding level of leadership courses, 90% of GC-Scholars have participated in peer-tutoring/mentoring activities at their respective campus, 85% of GC-Scholars were recommended for continuation in the GC-Scholars Program and receive scholarship awards, and 85% of scholars surveyed rated the GC-Scholars Program as satisfactory or favorable.

Future economic development along the Gulf Coast Interstate 10 Corridor, centering on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, focuses on these five sectors.  Additionally, the elimination of economic barriers associated with pursuing STEM degrees for students with demonstrated financial need will assist in upward economic mobility of low-income families and communities.\n\nLessons Learned:  Over the life of this S-STEM grant award, the most important lesson learned is the merging of online leadership courses with GC-Scholars and members of the campus leadership support team, which is the most important variable in connecting and retaining students in a STEM community of learners.  Progression through the online leadership courses allows GC-Scholars to learn leadership skills and learn about themselves.  The creation of the STEM community of learners allows for mentorship among GC-Scholars as well receiving mentorship from faculty involved with the online leadership courses.\n\nIn summary, the GC-Scholars Program provided financial support to academically talented students pursuing degrees/careers in STEM-related fields based on financial need.  In addition to the financial support, the Online Leadership Courses allowed for the creation of a STEM community of learners for the purpose of providing mentorship and teaching leadership skills.  GC-Scholars were further exposed to mentorship and leadership skills via STEM leadership conferences.  Through the generous financial support of NSF, the GC-Scholars Program was able to produce more STEM majors for transfer to baccalaurate STEM programs or obtain employment in local STEM-related career fields.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Rankin"
