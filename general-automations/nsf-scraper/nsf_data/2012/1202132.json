 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative program, partnering Duke University and Kyma Technologies, Inc., is to further the fundamental understanding and related process and manufacturing practice of the nucleation and subsequent epitaxial growth of III-N device structures on native III-N substrates and templates. The focus is on assessing the root causes of current limitations in materials quality and manufacturing yield and cost of III-N devices which will, in turn, serve to help develop and implement sound engineering strategies for more robust, high yield processes. The III-N device market is expected to reach $100B or more over the long term driven primarily by energy-efficient solid-state lighting and power electronics.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the research derives from determining which physical, chemical, and morphological characteristics of III-N substrates dominate nucleation processes thereby establishing thin-film microstructure determining device-critical electronic and optical properties. The metrics for substrate properties, in addition to the epitaxial growth processes and film structures for creating device-quality substrate-epitaxial layer interfaces and buffer layers, will be articulated.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project are both the strong social and environmental impacts of the realization of safe and energy-efficient light emitters and electronic devices, as well as enhancing the semiconductor device and materials workforce through the collaborative engagement of engineering students, industry scientists/engineers, and faculty. A new forum, POISE (PhD Opportunities in Small-Business Enterprises) will be created with the aim of preparing, transitioning, and retaining PhD students in industry.",
