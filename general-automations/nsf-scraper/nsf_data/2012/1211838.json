 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative program will develop and implement a new technique for measuring the growth of dark matter structure from galaxy clustering. While most techniques that use galaxy clustering to constrain cosmological parameters focus on measurements at the largest scales, the investigators aim to use clustering at the smallest scales, making full use of the information available in the data with the goal of developing a new cosmological probe based on the relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos that can be applied to existing data and future surveys.  This approach could develop into a leading probe of dark energy and other cosmological parameters with the next generation of photometric surveys.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of graduate students, release of computer code to the community, and outreach via public lectures.",
