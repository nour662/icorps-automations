Of special interest is whether the context of the movement, such as whether or not it performs a communicative function, fundamentally changes the coordination principles. The proposed research brings together an interdisciplinary team of biologists, linguists, and psychologists to investigate the movements of a diverse set of animals: human, octopus, and a nematode worm. The work allows, for the first time, a comparison of communicative and non-communicative actions both within and between animal species. The cross-species comparisons also allow an exploration of how symbolic and discrete linguistic communication in humans could have evolved from the continuously moving tongue and arms. More generally, movement control systems, in common with the human linguistic system, have a generative capacity to create new functional complex movements (or sentences) from smaller subparts. Does muscular control underlie this generative capacity in any way? \r\n\r\nThe inclusion of both dysarthric speech movements and signed speech enhances the broader impacts of these experiments. In addition, the worm C. elegans shows promise as a model for the dysarthria that occurs in Parkinson's disease; dopamine synthesis and uptake in C. elegans  will be manipulated so as to model the abnormal dopamine signaling in people with Parkinson's disease. The investigators have also partnered with the USC Neighborhood Academic Initiative to bring the research to the attention of students in local high schools, especially those serving minority students under-represented in science.",
