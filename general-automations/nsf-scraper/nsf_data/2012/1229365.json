 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultracentrifuge that is requested with this proposal is an essential piece of equipment for research characterizing and bioengineering light sensitive proteins from cyanobacteria. It is necessary to separate proteins from the E.coli expression system that are used for bioengineering proteins. The focus of The Spiller Lab is to engineer a small, bright red fluorescent protein tag for in vivo microscopy. Undergraduate, post baccalaureate and glide-year students at Mills College are engaged in the laboratory work. They gain research experience and expertise, while participating in leading edge research. Another goal of Spiller Lab is to encourage young women to pursue scientific careers. Spiller Lab was awarded a NSF-CBET-0967965 grant in April 2010 to fund this research. An ultracentrifuge is one of the critical pieces of equipment for this project. The Spiller Lab is currently working on a leading-edge research project in collaboration with Center for Biophotonics Science and Technology (CBST), University of California, Davis. They are using PCR, and E.coli expression system, to capture, characterize and purify GAF domains from the five (5) class II (blue/green) cyanobacteriochromes.",
