 "awd_abstract_narration": "1159398/1159759 \r\nCirino/Tang\r\n\r\nPolyketides are an important class of bioactive natural products. The complexity of these compounds demands that their synthesis be conducted by dedicated enzymes with exquisite catalytic properties. Directed evolution of natural product pathway enzymes is limited by the lack of general high-throughput screens for the complex target compounds, as well as the genetic intractability of most organisms expressing these pathways. The proposed research addresses this technology gap through the engineering of synthetic genetic networks that can respond to a desired polyketide compound. Many bacterial regulatory proteins naturally control gene expression in response to a specific \"effector\" molecule.  We will screen mutant libraries of regulatory proteins to isolate variants that activate expression of a reporter gene in response to polyketide compounds of interest. Then, using E. coli outfitted with the synthetic regulatory circuit, the aromatic polyketide biosynthetic pathway will be engineered towards enhanced production of bioactive metabolites and biosynthesis of new, \"unnatural\" compounds.\r\n\r\nThis project is cofunded by the Biotehchnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering Program, Chemical, Bioengineerng, Environmental and Transport Systems Division, Engineering Directorate, and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division of MPS.",

In the current project we were able to broaden this technology to develop sensor-reporter systems for more complex compounds in natural product biosynthesis. We have designed and characterized a variety of reporters for triacetic acid lactone (TAL) and related 2-pyrone analogues - compounds whose biosyntheses report on polyketide synthase enzymes (PKSs) having different substrate specificities (accepting different starter or extender units). We have discovered similar reporters for phenolics. Our biosensor sequences are published and our sensor DNA constructs have been requested (and received) by many labs, for use both as molecular reporters and as novel ligand-responsive regulators within genetic circuits. The award also facilitated crystal structure determination, and more detailed mechanistic analyses of one TAL sensor. Sensor systems and technological advances resulting from this project are currently enabling the directed evolution of functional expression of a PKS that is otherwise insoluble (and not functional) in E. coli. The development of a catalogue of sensors responsive to different compounds, combined with crystal structural analysis and computational modeling, enable further designs of next-generation sensors with enhanced specificity and sensitivities.
