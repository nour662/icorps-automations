The host scientist is Takao Mori.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is the investigation of the thermoelectric properties of various boron compounds. Materials prepared at Kansas State University will be characterized at the National Institute of Materials Science to assess their potential to convert heat into electricity and produce cutting-edge knowledge about the synthesis of new compounds and crystals.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

In fact, due to thermodynamic inefficiencies in most power producing systems, excess heat is generated and must be dissipated.

My relationships with international students at my home institution will be strengthened through my experience in Japan.\n\n     The land and environment of Japan is beautiful unto itself, but it is the warm and generous people that make Japan so special. Wherever I visited, friends and strangers both were patient, giving, and always lent a helping hand, even when I was too shy to ask. Spending a weekend with a host family was inspiring as I was able to live as the Japanese do in a Japanese home. Even though the stay was only for a couple of days, I felt at home and as a part of the family. I was touched so deeply that I will serve as a host family in the future with hopes to make others feel as welcome in my country as I did in Japan.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Clint D Frye"
