The symposium, to be held in Brazil in early 2014, is designed to facilitate exchange and collaboration across scientific and engineering disciplines and to enhance networks among early-career scientists and engineers.  This would be the first bilateral Frontiers meeting involving both young scientists and engineers at the same meeting, and will also be the first to be held in Latin America. \r\n\r\nAbout 60-70 outstanding early-career scientists and engineers from the United States and Brazil (30-35 from each side) are expected to participate and attend this symposium.  A program organizing committee, led by co-chairs from the U.S. and Brazil and consisting of additional members, will identify topics and speakers.  The symposium format will include formal sessions with presentations by speakers on leading edge research, emerging technologies, and with multiple opportunities for informal interactions across science and engineering fields.  Similar symposia in other regions have fostered interdisciplinary and international collaborations, and have served as a reference point for many of the emerging frontiers in research and innovation in the U.S.  Presentations from the USBFOS&E will be posted on the NAS and NAE-FOE web sites.",
