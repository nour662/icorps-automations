The deactivation of the anode from the practical fuels is a major barrier to realize the commercial and environmental benefits of the SOFC technology. This Materials World Network project is bringing a new paradigm to overcome electrode deactivation issues, significantly enhance SOFC performance and durability and consequently facilitate the rapid application and commercialization of the SOFC technology. Widespread deployment of the SOFC technology will make energy conversion more efficient and more environmentally benign. The collaborative project is educating and preparing US graduate students with a global perspective and multidisciplinary skills needed to tackle complex problems in areas of material science and energy conversion technologies. Outreach to the public and underrepresented groups from this project will not only place into context the societal need for efficient, alternative sources of power production, but also help to prepare a qualified workforce to overcome the many challenges that impede the development and deployment of fuel cell technologies. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: The objective of this Materials World Network project between the University of South Carolina and the China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing is to fabricate, characterize and elucidate mechanisms of high performance ceramic anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with enhanced tolerance to carbon deposition (coking) and sulfur poisoning in order to achieve direct conversion of practical fuels to electricity using SOFC technologies. Double perovskite materials with compositions of Sr2FexMo2-xO6-y (x varies from 1 to 2) are being created specifically to overcome the durability problems that limit the lifetime of conventional anodes. Fundamental understanding of the double perovskite materials are guiding further development of mixed ionic and electronic conducting ceramic materials as SOFC anodes. Freeze-drying tape casting is being used to create and maintain porous ceramic anode microstructure to reduce concentration polarization. Novel sintering process with sintering aids are being studied to obtain gas impermeable thin electrolyte membrane to reduce Ohmic losses. A variety of advanced characterization methods are being applied, including X-ray and neutron diffraction, electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, dilatometry, and micro X-ray computed tomography to deconvolute the composition, microstructure, defect chemistry, and electrochemical and catalytic property relationships. \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Ceramics Program and the Office of Special Programs in the Division of Materials Research.",
