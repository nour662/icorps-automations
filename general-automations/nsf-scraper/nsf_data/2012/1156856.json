 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of Kansas that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2012- 2014. This award is supported by both the NSF Directorate for Biosciences and the Department of Defense ASSURE program (thru a Memorandum of Understanding with NSF). The program will provide students with exciting research projects and experiences that build self-confidence and encourage critical and independent thinking.   An important underlying theme of the program is unity through diversity.   This theme is captured in the science, which ranges from studies on the behavior of individual molecules to that of whole organisms, and in the ethnic and cultural makeup of the students.  Several faculty mentors from the Department of Molecular Biosciences, with strong records of undergraduate mentoring and collegiality, will participate in the program. In addition to conducting research, the students will attend enrichment seminars and workshops including faculty and peer presentations on how to become a research scientist; workshops on applying to graduate school; and workshops on the development of effective communication skills.  The program will include several opportunities for the students to present their work and will conclude with a campus-wide mini symposium and a written final report.  The program is especially interested in training students who do not have the opportunity to conduct research at their home institutions and/or are from underrepresented and minority groups.  Several mechanisms of summative and formative evaluation will be employed including the assessment tool common to REU programs.  Program alumni will receive updates about each other through Facebook and have continued access to the REU program director and faculty mentors. These follow-up activities are devised to provide career-long advising to the students and to facilitate effective long-term tracking.  More information is available by visiting http://molecularbiosciences.ku.edu/reumb/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Robert Cohen at rcohen@ku.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Victoria Corbin at corbin@ku.edu).",

The program&rsquo;s overall mission was to increase the number of students who will pursue a research career in the biological sciences. To accomplish this goal, undergraduate students from outside KU spent 10 weeks on campus conducting exciting and doable research projects in the multidisciplinary laboratories of the Department of Molecular Biosciences. Each student received hands-on training in their discipline, and faculty and peer mentoring as they developed their project and communicated their results. In addition to their research activities, each cohort of students attended common seminar series on scientific communication and careers in the biological sciences, which enhanced their training and provided excellent opportunities for community building. The scientific communication seminars consisted of practical exercises on topics including content mapping, elevator talks, preparing a scientific abstract, and the elements in a formal scientific talk and poster presentation. The career seminars consisted of 90-minute question and answer sessions with a variety of science professionals including faculty members, science writers, intellectual property lawyers, industrial scientists and a graduate s student who had conducted a science policy internship at the White House. Community building, which has been shown to have positive outcomes on persistence in science, was further enhanced by housing the students together with undergraduate students participating in other campus REU programs, and by a number of social activities including attending a Kansas City Royals baseball game. At the end of the summer program, each student wrote a thorough scientific report on their research project and communicated their results in a poster presented at the annual KU summer research symposium that brought together nearly 100 students who participated in summer research at KU.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Over the three-year program, 31 students participated in the program, of which 14 were from underrepresented minorities including 2 Native Americans, and 15 were women.
