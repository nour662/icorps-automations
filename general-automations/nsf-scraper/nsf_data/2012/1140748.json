Project tasks include: 1) creating application-specific classroom hardware and lab modules; 2) enhancing hands-on learning in the three engineering technology programs; 3)  improving teaching effectiveness and collaboration among faculty members; 4)  enhancing curriculum to better respond to workforce requirement in industry; and 5) increasing diversity. Using a customized educational microcontroller board and an inclusive suite of co-developed teaching materials and lab projects, students will engage microcontroller-based, automobile-related measurement and control education using hands-on laboratories. CET students will gain practical experience in microcontroller applications solving real-world problems; AET students will learn basic automotive microcontroller management control and sensor functionality using specially designed laboratory equipment; MET students will have new lab experiments to help visualize abstract statics and dynamics concepts. \r\n\r\nThe project's interdisciplinary approach will not only better prepare students for the knowledge and skills needed for future employment, but also provide significant experience for them to work in teams, a valuable experience for today's industry needs. The project can also serve as a model for interdisciplinary curriculum/laboratory development nationwide.",

The strategy enables seamless integration of lab modules into the core courses of several technology programs. The project deliverables offer features including: a) a unique integration of essential automotive sensing, controlling, and communication units into a student oriented laboratory control unit, b) new educational tools to augment a number of existing courses that are offered in AET, CET and MET\nprograms, and c) creation of a platform for senior design or independent study courses, where students can continue to utilize the acquired skills and knowledge. The project also lends both hardware and software support for developing new contents and courses in all three programs.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nThe project?s focus on developing microcontroller components and laboratories, which are generalizable to automotive technology education : a) facilitates the development of a robust and unified curriculum for AET programs nationwide, and b) proactively addresses the challenge of improving the microcontroller knowledge base of automotive curriculums to keep pace with increasing use of microcontrollers by automotive designers. Predictably, this approach to teaching microcontrollers has a positive effect on recruitment and retention by adding more practical hands-on activities.
