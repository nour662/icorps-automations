The general focus of the workshop will be radio emission from hot and cool stars during the main sequence and post-main sequence evolutionary phases.  An underlying theme will be \"radio stars as players in our Galaxy,\" emphasizing how radio observations provide an effective probe of the roles of various types of stars in the Galactic ecosystem and the interplay between stars and their environments.",
