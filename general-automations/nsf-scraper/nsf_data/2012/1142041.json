 "awd_abstract_narration": "McConnell/1142166\r\n\r\nThis award supports a project to use unprecedented aerosol and continuous gas (methane, carbon monoxide) measurements of the deepest section of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core to investigate rapid climate changes in Antarctica during the ~60,000 year long Marine Isotope Stage 3 period of the late Pleistocene. These analyses, combined with others, will take advantage of the high snow accumulation of the WAIS Divide ice core to yield the highest time resolution glaciochemical and gas record of any deep Antarctic ice core for this time period. The research will expand already funded discrete gas measurements and extend currently funded continuous aerosol measurements on the WAIS Divide ice core from ~25,000 to ~60,000 years before present, spanning Heinrich events 3 to 6 and Antarctic Isotope Maximum (AIM, corresponding to the Northern Hemisphere Dansgaard-Oeschger) events 3 to 14. With other high resolution Greenland cores and lower resolution Antarctic cores, the combined record will yield new insights into worldwide climate dynamics and abrupt change. The intellectual merit of the work is that it will be used to address the science goals of the WAIS Divide project including the identification of dust and biomass burning tracers such as black carbon and carbon monoxide which reflect mid- and low-latitude climate and atmospheric circulation patterns, and fallout from these sources affects marine and terrestrial biogeochemical cycles.  Similarly, sea salt and ocean productivity tracers reflect changes in sea ice extent, marine primary productivity, wind speeds above the ocean, and atmospheric circulation. Volcanic tracers address the relationship between northern, tropical, and southern climates as well as stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet and sea level change.   When combined with other gas records from WAIS Divide, the records developed here will transform understanding of mid- and low-latitude drivers of Antarctic, Southern Hemisphere, and global climate rapid changes and the timing of such changes. The broader impacts of the work are that it will enhance infrastructure through expansion of continuous ice core analytical techniques, train students and support collaboration between two U.S. institutions (DRI and OSU). All data will be made available to the scientific community and the public and will include participation the WAIS Divide Outreach Program.  Extensive graduate and undergraduate student involvement is planned. Student recruitment will be made from under-represented groups building on a long track record. Broad outreach will be achieved through collaborations with the global and radiative modeling communities, NESTA-related and other educational outreach efforts, and public lectures. This proposed project does not require field work in the Antarctic.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to investigate changes in the amount of methane in the atmosphere during the time period from about 9,000 to 67,000 years ago, using a new measurement method that is much more precise and detailed than previously used.  This new method involves cutting long, narrow sticks of ice out of an ice core and slowly melting them to release the air trapped in the ice then analyzing the air using a laser based system.  In this way the air in the ice is measured continuously and no details are missed.\n\n \n\nThe method was applied to ice samples from a new ice core in Antarctica (the WAIS Divide ice core).  This core is unique because it us from a place with very high annual snowfall, and therefore provides a detailed climate record.  The result of the project is the most detailed record of atmospheric methane yet produced.  It shows in great detail how abrupt climate change in the northern hemisphere impacts the total amount of methane in the atmosphere.  It also shows previously unknown types of methane variations &ndash; abrupt changes during relatively cold periods of northern hemisphere climate, that are now believed to be a signature of large changes in tropical rain belts, that influence methane production from wetlands.  The developing hypothesis is that incursions of icebergs in the North Atlantic ocean during these cold periods perturb the tropical ocean and atmosphere and move tropical rain belts southward.\n\nThe main results of the study are published in Science (Rhodes et al., Science, v 348, p. 1016, 2015) and the data are available online (ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/pub/DATASETS/AGDC/nsidc0628_rhodes/). \n\nThis project contributed to training a post doctoral researcher and an undergraduate student, advanced analytical capabilities in ice core research, and revealed previously unknown variations in atmospheric methane.\n\nThe project also confirms that no large overshoots in methane concentration occurred during the abrupt climate changes of the last ice age that would implicate large changes in controversial sources of methane like sea floor methane hydrates.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward J Brook"
