 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Macrofungi Collection Consortium: Unlocking a Biodiversity Resource for Understanding Biotic Interactions, Nutrient Cycling and Human Affairs\r\n\r\nMushrooms and related fungi (macrofungi) play a critical role in the lives of plants and animals, including humans, yet their diversity is underestimated. Understanding this diversity will be critical in analyzing impacts of habitat change, nutrient cycling in ecosystems, and distributions and diversity of host organisms.   Scientists in the U.S. have been studying these fungi for the past 150 years, resulting in a legacy of approximately 1.4 million dried scientific specimens conserved in 35 institutions in 24 states.  These institutions have now joined in an effort to digitize and share online all data associated with macrofungi specimens.  The resulting resource will enable a national census of macrofungi, never before attempted, and will allow researchers to better understand the diversity of these organisms and the relationship between macrofungi and the organisms with which they form intimate relationships.\r\n\r\nOrganized into clubs across the country, citizen mycologists play an important role in documenting macrofungi diversity, and these enthusiastic individuals are the conduit between professional scientists and the general public for critical information about wild edible and poisonous fungi.  Citizen mycologists will join the collections institutions in this project to help to create the on-line resource.  The project will fund two workshops for high school teachers to promote classroom study of fungi.  University students employed by the project will gain work experience in digitization and formal training about fungi.  Students will share the knowledge they gain through oral and video presentations. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs a result of this project, 110,439 specimen labels along with 21,360 specimen images of macrofungi have been digitized and uploaded to the online database known as the Mycology Collections Portal (MyCoPortal) at www.mycoportal.org.  The Illinois Natural History Survey at the University of Illinois digitized 25,096 specimen labels in addition to contributing 46,916 existing specimen records that were previously digitized.  The Field Museum digitized 23,700 specimen labels along with 16,640 specimen images.  Eastern Illinois University added 13,745 specimen labels and 3000 specimen images, while the University of Central Oklahoma digitized 982 specimen labels and contributed 1,720 specimen images.  These macrofungi records with their associated images of actual specimens serve as a major resource to scientists, public land managers, students, and amateur enthusiasts.  Since our specimen data has been uploaded online to these portals, we have received several inquiries from other researchers to send digital images of these specimens rather than the actual specimens, saving time and money.  In addition, experts in macrofungi have been able to examine our data online and have assisted in the updating and annotation of taxonomic names of our specimens to their most current and correct names, thereby increasing the overall quality of our collections.  Our digitized specimen data spans a wide geographic and historic range and includes a large breath of taxonomic groups, which allows environmental models to predict how species distributions have changed due to major environmental events across time and space.  Because most of our specimen records are georeferenced, large-scale distribution mapping can elucidate regions where such changes have occurred while also identifying biodiversity hotspots and under sampled areas.  This project has not only raised the profile of macrofungi as organisms of great interest and ecological importance but also the profile of collections and their associated digitization efforts that provide real value for science, conservation and recreation.\n\n \n\nThis project has served as an excellent opportunity to train the next generation of collection managers in the latest digitization techniques at our four institutions.  Six postgraduate students and six undergraduate students have received training in the fundamentals of mycology, collection management and collection digitization, including the photographing of specimen labels, annotation slips and selected specimens, the organization, backup and transfer of record and image data to a central collection server, the transcription of specimen label data, and the georeferencing of specimen locality data.  Providing specimen information on our fungus holdings to the public online has been extremely valuable for promoting our collections through their use in scientific studies and for establishing species checklists throughout the US.  The importance of this project to the scientific, amateur and citizen science community was discussed at nineteen events and at three conference presentations.  The digital image equipment, workflows and training of staff from this project translates into a continuation of the project long after the funding ends at each institution.  The Illinois Natural History Survey and the Field Museum participate in ongoing formal and informal training of volunteers and students where we provide demonstrations of the techniques, equipment and workflow used in this project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew N Miller"
