This project focuses on the evolution of magmas emplaced in mafic sills associated with the Proterozoic Franklin Igneous event as exposed on Victoria Island, Canada. Through cooperation with the Canadian Geological Survey, the PI has been involved in field mapping of these sills and has access to three complete drill cores through one of the sills. Detailed studies of this sill are proposed to decipher the differentiation mechanisms that have operated during and after emplacement of the intrusion. The sill is relatively thin (26 to 44 m thick), laterally extensive (>36 kms of strike length), and remarkably differentiated for such a thin magma body (Mg#s vary systematically from 35 to 82). Upper and lower chilled margins with ~10% olivine phenocrysts give way abruptly to olivine-free diabasic rocks in the interior, suggesting that any suspended phenocrysts settled out rapidly, or were segregated in some way from the sill margins. Indeed an olivine-rich zone 5 to 8 m thick occurs near the base of the sills. Near-constant olivine composition throughout isconsistent with injection of an olivine-porphrytic magma, followed by en-masse settling of olivine. A thin (1 to 2 m thick) layer above the olivine zone contains abundant, euhedral, sector-zoned augite. Diabase, which makes up the upper 80% of the sill, becomes progressively Mg-poor and Fe-rich upward from the base and downward from the roof to an Fe-Ti-excluded element rich \"sandwich\" zone near the center of the sill. The variation trend in the diabase cannot be explained by the removal of olivine and augite phenocrysts from the initial magma, and must have resulted from in-situ differentiation of the diabase. A Mg# ?kick? in the lower diabase can be traced horizontally for over 10 kms, and appears to represent a magma recharge event. Although the sill is Proterozoic, geochemical modeling of preliminary data, suggests that neither major nor trace elements have been significantly altered. The summed bulk composition of the sill very closely matches a chilled margin composition. Petrography and chemical analyses of the constituent minerals is proposed to interpret rock textures with regards to possible post-emplacement compaction and melt migration in the crystal mush. CSD grain size variations will be examined to determine the nucleation and growth history of the major minerals present. Goals of the proposed study are to evaluate: [1] the origin of, and compaction and re-equilibration within, the olivine-rich basal zone, [2] mineral textural and compositional variations above and below the recharge horizon, and [3] the origin of in-situ differentiation trends recorded in the diabase at the floor and roof of the sill, and the role of compaction in these two sequences.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts. This project is being carried out in collaboration with a five-year regional mapping program of the Geological Survey of Canada. The Victoria Island sills are similar in composition and tectonic setting to sills in Siberia that host Noril'sk-type Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization; a better understanding of their emplacement and crystallization history may lead to improved exploration strategies for similar deposits. Although these thin sills represent one extreme end-member of the differentiated magma chamber suite, they may provide critical insights into initial crystallization processes in larger magma chambers where the record of the early crystallization history has been overwritten by later re-equilibration during slow cooling. This project will also provide excellent educational opportunities for the student participants.",

Our work was done in collaboration with the Canadian Geologic Survey, which provided transportation to the field area, and transportation, food, and lodging within the field area.  The Victoria Island sills that we examined represent horizontal magma sheets, 20 to 50 meters thick, and greater than 10 kms in lateral extent.  These sills were chosen for study because they are similar to a series of sills in the Norilsk Region of Siberia that host ore deposits mined for platinum, palladium, copper, and nickel. The project was designed to investigate how compositional differences develop in an initially homogeneous magma during crystallization.  Specifically we were interested in how the concentration of specific elements, related to ore deposits, may have developed.\n\n \n\n     1.  We have been able to demonstrate that in-situ crystallization can have a significant effect on the differentiation of igneous magmas even in thin (45 m thick) upper-crustal level sills.  The fractionation of plagioclase and augite, crystallizing in-situ, has resulted in the development of a pronounced Fe-enrichment differentiation trend in these sills.  Such a trend results in the concentration of iron and excluded trace elements such as La, Ce, Zr, Nb, and U in a zone near the top of the sill.  Some previously published studies have suggested that no in-situ differentiation can occur in crustal level magma chambers.  Even some other studies that suggest in-situ differentiation is possible, would argue against any in-situ differentiation in such thin sills.\n\n \n\n     2.  We have shown that basal, olivine-rich zones found in many tholeiitic sills can be formed by the post-emplacement, settling of phenocrysts from a relatively homogeneous, phenocryst-phyric, initial magma.  In other tholeiitic sills, like the Palisades Sill of NY and NJ, USA, the basal olivine-rich zone appears to have formed by the post-emplacement injection of a second, phenocryst-rich, slurry into a pre-existing magma body.  Profiles through the two types of basal olivine-rich zones are very different in terms of mineral modes, olivine grain-sizes, and olivine compositions.  The mode of formation of these basal zones has important implications for the distribution of Ni and Mg in igneous sills.\n\n \n\n     3.  We have documented a second mechanism for olivine re-equilibration in intrusive rocks.  The previous described \"olivine trapped liquid shift effect\", reported from a number of locations, results in a larger shift to more Fe-rich olivine compositions in samples with low olivine abundances, and a smaller shift in samples with high olivine abundances.  In three olivine-rich zones in Victoria Island sills which have been examined in detail, we have observed the opposite re-equilibration result, in that samples with the most abundant olivine at the top of the accumulation zone are more Fe-rich, than samples with the least olivine at the base of the zone.  We suggest that re-equilibration took place during settling of initial olivine phenocrysts, so that the olivine at the top of the zone, which settled the farthest, and was exposed to the most magma, is the most re-equilibrated. \n\n \n\n     4.  One of the sills in the Victoria Island study has an extensive horizon that represents a magma recharge event in the initial magma chamber.  This event, however, does not appear to be associated with a concentration of precious metals, as has been postulated for recharge events in other intrusions.  The small size of the recharge event and the nature of the recharging magma appear to have precluded the formation of an ore horizon in the Victoria Island sill.  Likewise, no precious metal concentrations appear to be associated with the assimilation of crustal xenoliths in the Victoria Island sills, a mechanism that has been proposed in other intrusive bodies. \n\n \n\nFive graduate students have been supported in part by NSF grant #1220374.
