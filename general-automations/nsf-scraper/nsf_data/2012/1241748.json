 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ensuring the security of the world's and the US nation's computers and networks is a key national challenge. A significant need exists in Delaware and northern Maryland for trained cybersecurity graduates critical to large regional employers. This Regional Cybersecurity Education Initiative, formed by the University of Delaware (UD), Delaware Technical and Community College (DTCC), and Harford Community College (HCC) along with government and industrial partners is establishing ongoing education and research collaborations that is building programmatic capacity and establishing a pipeline of graduates skilled in the theories and practices required to address these challenging Cybersecurity issues. The project is completing initiatives including: expanded Cybersecurity courses and Minor at UD producing students able to design state of the art secure software and systems, a 2+2 Program to allow 2nd year DTCC and HCC student to transfer into four year UD CIS and CPEG BS degree programs, and establishing cybersecurity outreach including an internship program, middle and high school student and teacher summer camps and bridge programs to energize and attract the next generation of Cybersecurity professionals. The program's initiatives are establishing a sustainable comprehensive approach to engaging and educating a continuous pipeline of Cybersecurity professionals. The intellectual merit of the proposed activities centers on the new discoveries made possible by students, faculty, and professional partners through the unique collaborations and established creative education and outreach programs. The education and outreach activities, and the regional and national capacity needs addressed, directly represent the programmatic broader impacts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF Collaborative Project: A Regional Cybersecurity Education Initiatve  addressed the following objectives:\n\nCapacity Building\nOutreach\nDual Enrollment\nCareer Coach\nInternships\nOnline Course Delivery\nAdditional Lab Technology\n\n\nHarford Community College, in collaboration with the University of Delaware, was able to achieve each objective, although some objectives were completed more substantially than others as noted below.\n\nHarford Community College developed new cyber courses of an introductory nature as well as a more advanced level.  As the faculty studied the need for new cyber courses, it became evident that a new introductory level course would be beneficial to students and the cyber program in general.  Consequently, a new course - ISS 105: Introduction to Cybersecurity was created.  In addition, to address the need for more advanced courses that may also lead to an industry certification, a new course in Ethical Hacking has been created.\n\nOutreach activities were planned during the summer for high school students.  However, interest in the activity was limited and the faculty found an Open House cyber event during the spring semester to be more valuable and attract more students to learn more about cybersecurity as well as the cyber program in general. \n\nAs noted above, the new ISS 105 course has been developed and will be available for high school dual enrollment in spring 2017.  The design of this course required a substantial amount of time since we are \"paving new terrritory\" in many cases.  Innovation and emerging were two (2) general themes that could be attached to this initiative.  Furthermore, Harford Community College worked with the local high schools to encourage and support enrollment in our other cyber courses - CISCO I and CISCO II.  We have attracted recent high school graduates to these classes. Harford Community College faculty also worked with local high school CTE faculty in developing an articulation agreeement. which was finalized in spring 2016.\n\nFaculty mentoring has been successful and students are completing the cyber courses in a satisfactory manner.  We have discovered that the majority of students who do not complete the courses or the cyber degree are not able to complete the CISCO networking courses in our current compressed format.  Consequently, faculty are investigating other scheduling and/or delivery options to address this situation.  This has been a major discovery for the faculty and has supported faculty efforts to consider potential course modifications to achieve the necessary outcomes for the courses.\n\nHarford Community College has experienced substantial success with internships.  We have students working for local private industry, federal contractors and DOD commands.  Of particular note, we have students working as NSA interns.  The interns are also serving as guest speakers to our current classes to encourage degree completion.\n\nHarford Community College developed several cyber courses for online delivery.  Faculty continue to design the courses using the Quality Matters rubric.  Opportunities to create a modular format to the online courses continues to be explored and implemented so that students may be able to receive credit for prior work experience.\n\nHarford Community College procured a new state-of-art cyber lab and is planning to expand the lab further in spring 2017 with TAACCCT grant funds.\n\nIn addition to these specific objectives, it should be noted that Harford Community College has partnered with UDEL to articulate the AAS cyber degree to UDEL's program. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/07/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Mayhorne"
