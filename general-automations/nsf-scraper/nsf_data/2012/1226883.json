 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the hardware, control and planning technologies required to achieve soft robotic systems, in order to offer inherent safety and adaptation to the human-machine systems of the future. The project is motivated by a broad range of aspects of human-robot interaction, including soft augmentation tools for safe compliant manipulation, soft exoskeletons for rehabilitation of neuromuscular disorders, or active clamping systems that can conform to arbitrary surfaces. The proposed research will address the algorithmic and device-level challenges that arise in the design of soft compliant robots capable of pose-invariant and shape-invariant grasping. A combination of algorithmic solutions to modeling, control, planning, and adaptation will lead to new soft compliant manipulators that do not need accurate geometric models for grasping. By designing soft compliant fingers and hands, new approaches to grasp planning and manipulation will be enabled. A novel composable actuation system and supporting planning and control algorithms with features inspired by natural muscle will be developed.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Soft robots are inherently low-cost. Affordable soft manipulators will enable in-home assistants for the elderly or incapacitated, but these robots must be able to manipulate the natural world as easily as people do. The next generation robot manipulators will also support new levels of factory automation, in which robots will work synergistically with humans with the ultimate goal of reducing the cost of manufacturing in the USA. The proposed soft devices will provide a new approach to assistive and rehabilitative usage of compliant robotic platforms. Their functional compliant properties will enable them to work side-by-side with human beings or as part of their bodies, to augment and improve human productivity and performance. This new wearable soft robotic technology will not only help workers perform tasks, but also improve the quality of life for many people. In addition, the PIs have a long tradition of integrating research and education by providing research training at all levels, from high-school teachers and students to undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs. A range of activities to reach out to undergraduate students, high-school communities, women and minorities is planned.",

The industrial robots are masterpieces of engineering that can do so much more than people do. Yet these robots remain isolated from humans on the factory floors because they are large heavy and dangerous to be around. By comparison organisms in nature are soft safe compliant and much more dexterous and intelligent. Soft bodied systems like the octopus can move with greater agility, they can bend and twist continuously and compliantly and have the potential to execute tasks that require dexterity and strength. This project explored new types of robots, with the objective of bringing machines and materials closer together ? with machines becoming soft, like materials, and materials becoming intelligent and capable like machines. Soft refers to the body of the robot. Soft materials are the key enablers for creating soft robot bodies. Young?s Modulus which measures stress to strain&nbsp; is a useful measure of the rigidity of materials used in the fabrication of robotic systems. Materials traditionally used in robotics (e.g. metals, hard plastics), have moduli on the order of 10<sup>9</sup>?10<sup>12</sup> Pa, whereas natural organisms are often composed of materials (e.g. skin, muscle tissue) with moduli on the order of 10<sup>4</sup>?10<sup>9</sup> Pa (i.e. orders of magnitude lower than their engineered counterparts). We define soft robots as systems capable of autonomous behavior that are primarily composed of materials with moduli in the range of the moduli of soft biological materials.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the research conducted in this project contributed several new soft robotic devices that range from an autonomous robot fish to a soft limb inspired by the elephant trunk and a strong gripper called the Magic Origami Ball. We created and published recipes for making sofr robots. We developed new algorithms for grasping with soft robot hands that are robust under significant uncertainty in the object placement and knowledge of its shape. We developed new models for soft limbs and dynamic control algorithms. Our contributions have resulted in breakthroughs in: (1) rapid design tools and fabrication recipes for low-cost soft robots; (2) new algorithmic approaches to the modeling, optimizing, and control of soft robots that include ? and exploit ? their unique material properties; and (3) capable new systems that demonstrate the benefits of this technology and encourage broad early adopters. These advances will lead to soft robots that have the ability to compute, sense, and move, leading to a convergence between materials and machines, with materials becoming more intelligent due to embedded electro-mechanical components, and machines becoming softer due to the non-traditional materials used to create them. Thus, our project advances the science-base for soft, strong, and safe configurable robots that can adapt to a variety of tasks and environments.
