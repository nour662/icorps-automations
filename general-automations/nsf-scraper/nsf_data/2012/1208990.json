 "awd_abstract_narration": "****Technical Abstract****\r\nIn a wide range of natural and industrial situations, turbulent flows carry particulate material. As such, the dynamics of turbulent suspensions and aerosols has been an active area of research. Significant progress has been made in characterizing the motion of spherical particles in turbulence; much less is known, however, about the dynamics of anisotropic particles.  The rotation of anisotropic particles is determined by small scale properties of turbulence that are nearly universal across a wide range of flows, and so anisotropic particles provide a rich system where experiments can be directly compared with theory and simulations.  The research proposed here will provide the first high-resolution experimental measurements of the 3D dynamics of rod shaped particles in turbulence.  We will then extend these measurements to anisotropic objects across the full range of aspect ratios from rods to isotropic particles to disks.  We will also implement a recently developed measurement system that will allow extremely high seeding densities necessary to measure the velocity gradients of the flow simultaneously with measurements of rod motion.  This will allow measurement of the stretching experienced by the particle along its trajectory which is the fundamental quantity responsible for preferential alignment of anisotropic particles. Education and research training are central to this project, which will support the mentoring of undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoctoral scientist, as well as training K-12 educators in physical science.\r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\nIn a wide range of natural and industrial situations, turbulent flows carry particulate material.  For example, clouds are turbulent flows containing water droplets and ice crystals.  Papermaking uses turbulent suspensions of fibers.  If the particles are spheres, there are a variety of tools available for measuring their motion.  But usually the particles are not spheres, and the movement and rotations of non-spherical particles have never before been measured as they are carried by a turbulent flow.  This project will develop experimental tools to make these measurements.  Particle rotations are of particular interest because their statistics are expected to be similar in all turbulent flows, and measurements can be compared with theoretical predictions for the universal properties of turbulence.  This work seeks to establish a clear understanding of the fundamental characteristics of non-spherical particle motion in laboratory turbulent flows that can be used to understand more complex applications such as icy clouds and papermaking.  Education and research training are central to this project, which will support the mentoring of undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoctoral scientist, as well as training K-12 educators in physical science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report for Grant DMR-1208990 Greg Voth, Wesleyan University\n\nIntellectual Merit:  This project produced the first laboratory measurements of the rotations of non-spherical particles in turbulent fluid flows.   Many environmental and industrial situations involve turbulent fluid flows transporting particles with complex shapes.  Examples include fiber suspensions used in paper making, ice crystals in clouds, and plankton in the ocean.   The fundmental properties of the alignment and rotation of particles of complex shapes in highly turbulent flow had not been carefully studied, partly because of the difficulty of measuring the motion of these particles along their chaotic trajectories in turbulence.  \n\nThis project developed a system using multiple high speed video cameras to record and reconstruct the position and orientation of particles as they move in three dimensions.    An example of a measured trajectory is shown in the attached figure.   One of the key scientific insights to come out of this study was the strong alignment of particles in particular directions.  We naturally think of turbulence as a randomizing process, but particles are actually aligned by specific flow structures in the turbulence.  We find that particles are strongly aligned so that their long axis is preferentially along the rotation axis of the fluid around them.   This also led to new insights into the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows since this alignment is a result of vortex stretching process.  We learned how to predict the preferred orientation of particles by considering the stretching that the fluid around them had experienced.  We also developed a new laser scanning system that allowed us to measure the velocity gradients in the fluid at the same time that we measured the motion of fibers.\n\nBroader Impacts:  The preferential alignment of particles has implications for the statistics of rotation and alignment of particles in various applications.  For example, plankton of different shapes will experience quite different rotation and alignment.   It also has implications for the scattering of light and radar from icy clouds.  \n\nBeyond the impacts of our scientific results, this project had impacts through the training of young scientists.  Under this grant, one post-doc, three graduate students, and ?ve undergraduates were mentored in research.  One of these undergraduates won the Apker prize given by the American Physical Society to the best undergraduate researcher at a PhD granting institution in 2013 for research funded by this grant.
