 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds U Kei Cheang of Drexel University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Investigation of microswimming in biological fluid environment,\" during the summer of 2012 at Ewha University in Seoul and Hanyang University in Seoul.  The host scientists are Professor Sungsu Park and Professor Jaebum Choo.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is the understanding of the effects and relative importance of the many interactions influencing microbial transport in complex biomaterials. This is a challenging problem requiring a unique and innovative approach combining fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, microbiology, microfabrication, and digital image processing. The results of this work promise to establish the base of knowledge needed to properly understand microbial locomotion in a variety biological, health, environmental, and agricultural scenarios. In addition, the proposed work has the potential to transform understanding of locomotion and propulsion in realistic environments. Complex media affect microbial roles in infection, fertility, ecology, and environmental applications (such as bioremediation of pollutants and drinking water contamination). Demonstration of artificial bacteria control in synthetic bio-environment and establishing biological relevance through live cell comparison could have great impact on biology and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
