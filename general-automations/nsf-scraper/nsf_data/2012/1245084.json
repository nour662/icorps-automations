This system consists of an ultracold quantum gas strongly coupled to the optical and mechanical modes of a microtoroidal resonator. The project brings together concepts of micro-electromechanical systems engineering, nanofabrication and atomic physics to forge a hybrid quantum system for the quantum-limited control, manipulation and readout of an innovative optomechanical device. The transformative nature of this device includes pushing the frontier of ultra-cold atom trapping and manipulation at sub-microKelvin temperatures, exploiting the nature of optomechanical systems by providing a new tool for the measurement, manipulation and study of quantum properties of macroscopic mechanical modes and, ultimately, developing an important new technology for sensors that could lead to unprecedented precision for a rotation sensor that would, for example, significantly improve gyroscopes.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this program is the realization of a strongly coupled quantum system that combines the coherence and sensitivity of ultracold atomic gases with the robustness of a micromechanical device. The successful demonstration of such hybrid systems is one of the most significant open challenges in quantum information science and sensor technology. The architecture under study paves the way for a systematic study of key scientific issues including the ability of a quantum gas to control and enhance the sensitivity of micro-electromechanical force sensors.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this program is the unification of powerful concepts from the intellectually distinct domains of Electromechanical device engineering and ultracold atomic physics. In addition to answering fundamental questions regarding the interaction of quantum systems with macroscopic mechanical systems, the proposed system is an enabling technology for applications including inertial navigation systems, compact integrated frequency standards, ultrasensitive force sensors and quantum information science.",
