 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Tyler Fleetham of Arizona State University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Temperature and light intensity dependence of organic solar cells,\" during the summer of 2012 at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea.  The host scientist is Professor Changhee Lee.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is a comprehensive understanding of factors that affect the photocurrent and diode behavior of organic solar cells under various operating conditions.  Through characterizing photovoltaic parameters including the open circuit voltage and photocurrent at various temperatures for a wide range of materials the research results promise a greater understanding of the photovoltaic mechanisms of organic solar cells at a molecular level and lead to understanding the effect of molecular design on solar cell performance.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
