 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many questions in applied and computational mathematics, such as questions about the stability of differential or difference equations or questions about the convergence of iterative methods for solving linear systems, are really questions about norms of functions of matrices, such as matrix exponentials or matrix powers. In the case of a real symmetric matrix (or, more generally, a normal matrix), these questions are answered in terms of the matrix eigenvalues, but when the matrix is highly nonnormal (meaning that its eigenvectors are nearly linearly dependent or it does not have a complete set of eigenvectors), eigenvalues tell only part of the story. The asymptotic behavior of powers of matrix exponentials or the matrix itself for large exponents is still determined by the eigenvalues, but transient behavior is not. In this project, the principal investigator will use other sets in the complex plane that can be associated with a matrix, such as the field of values or the epsilon-pseudospectrum, to give more information about the behavior of such matrix functions e.g. for finite powers. In the other direction, new results about the behavior of such matrix functions will lead to new insights into problems in complex approximation theory.\r\n\r\nThis award will support work in the mathematical areas of matrix theory and complex analysis that is fundamental in many application areas in science and engineering. A range of mathematical methods is available for describing the long-term behavior of systems (will a radiation level eventually decay to zero, will flutter in an aircraft eventually die out), but a more crucial question may be what happens in the near-term. While a computer simulation may answer this question for a specific scenario, general results about what determines the transient behavior of such systems are often lacking. This project will provide better mathematical tools for analyzing such questions for a wide class of models. The award will support graduate student training in these areas through research assistantships.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to try to estimate norms of functions of matrices or linear operators using associated sets in the complex plane.  This is important in the stability analysis of differential equations and the finite difference methods used to solve them.  Eigenvalues (or the spectrum) can be used to describe certain behavior, but other tools are needed to truly understand the behavior of solutions to differential equations or finite difference equations.  One such tool is the field of values or numerical range.  \n\nA long open conjecture was that the 2-norm of any function of a matrix or operator A was less than or equal to twice the maximum absolute value of that function on the numerical range of A.  That conjecture is still open, but during the course of this project a dramatic advance was made.  The constant 2 was not proved, but 1 + sqrt(2), or, about 2.415 was proved by Cesar Palencia.  Perhaps more importantly, the method of proof could be extended to determine constants associated with any set in the complex plane containing the spectrum of A such that the 2-norm of any function of A is less than or equal to that constant times the maximum absolute value of the function on the set.  \n\nFor example, one often wishes to know whether the eigenvalues of a matrix A lie in the left half-plane.  If they do, then solutions to the system of differential equations y' = A y decay after some period of time, but eigenvalues alone give no information about the transient behavior of solutions.  If the numerical range of A lies in the left half-plane, then the 2-norm of solutions decays monotonically, which is a much stronger form of stability.  But what if the numerical range extends into the right half-plane?  Using some of the new ideas developed in this project, we can now determine a constant K such that, while the 2-norm of the solution may grow, it will always be bounded by K.  If K is of moderate size, then this establishes a practical form of stability even when the equation is not monotone.   \n\nIn the future, we hope to do more with applications of the results obtained in this project.
