 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes that haptic robots offer effective and\r\nattractive solutions to the common tasks of Bin-Picking and Kitting, which currently require human workers. A\r\npopular application area is programming an industrial robot to work with specific powertrain parts. The\r\nProblem: Bin-picking robots can only manipulate strong parts with simple geometries in structured or semistructured\r\nconfigurations; machine vision deals poorly with overlapping objects and unstable and unpredictable\r\nloads or grips. The Opportunity: Haptic systems can compliment machine vision systems using tactile sensory\r\ndata to cope with overlapping objects and unstable grip conditions. The Solution: A robotic hand/arm\r\nequipped with unique biomimetic tactile sensors to make a platform for developing grip algorithms for parts\r\npicking and kitting. Innovations include develop algorithms for slip-detection and force-cone grip adjustment;\r\ndeveloping adaptive algorithms using tactile feedback to improve grip pre-shaping; validating algorithms with\r\nphysical powertrain parts; and challenging algorithms with real-world uncertainties that are difficult to detect\r\nusing machine vision.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will result in robots that have more humanlike haptic\r\ncapabilities. Currently robots lack tactile sensing and rely on specialized component feeders and gripping tools\r\nto handle individual objects with predetermined gripping features. These items add cost, occupy space, and\r\nconsume time, especially when many different objects must be handled. This puts robots at a significant\r\ndisadvantage to human workers who use their hands dexterously to handle an unlimited variety of objects.\r\nNevertheless, robots are best suited to handle tasks that are highly repetitive or dangerous to humans. When\r\nrobots handle hazardous materials or manufacturing tasks, they relieve humans of these burdens while often\r\nyielding increased productivity and cost-savings. At the end of Phase I we will have developed a proof of\r\nconcept so that our Phase II research can integrate the system into an industrial environment. By addressing the\r\npicking of objects with errors in object pose, position and part-to-part interaction, haptic robots will transform\r\nthis important part of the manufacturing process. Such technology will have widespread impact on many\r\naspects of manufacturing and automation.",
