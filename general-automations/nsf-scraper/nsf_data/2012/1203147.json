Other talks of 10-12 minutes will be selected based on abstracts and delivered by an equal number of established investigators and trainees. To provide further opportunity for discussion and interaction among investigators and students, a poster session including both established investigators and students is also planned.\r\nThis workshop is strongly focused on education, training, connectivity and career building for graduate and post-graduate students. To this end, the organizers will ensure an equal number of presentations by students and established investigators Further, the attendance will be kept modest (50 to 70 participants), and there will be no parallel sessions. To encourage excellence in research and presentation, an award will be given for the best oral and the best poster presentation by a student. To enhance the educational component of the workshop, written feedback from evaluators will be provided for each student presenter",
