 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless networks are the dominant medium through which people connect to the Internet, communicate, do business and access information. The ever-growing demand for higher data rates places the conventional approaches to network design under considerable stress. To meet this demand, future wireless networks are rapidly evolving towards high-density, user-deployed, heterogeneous infrastructure characterized by very high data rates at shorter communication range, with possibly harsh interference. In this context, multiple flow and multiple hop communication is expected to play an increasingly important role. Yet, current visions of how such networks should be designed are limited by the fact that the fundamental understanding of such novel communication paradigms is still in its infancy. \r\n\r\nThis research addresses key questions about multihop multiflow networks in the form of new ideas, insights and tools, with a transformative impact on the design of future networks. The project is organized into three symbiotic research thrusts on extensibility, side information and algorithms. In the extensibility thrust, the investigators develop a new understanding of the capacity of multihop multiflow networks of prototypical network models. The side information thrust moves beyond idealized model assumptions and incorporates imperfect or uncertain conditions at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The third thrust on algorithms translates the new key ideas developed in the first two thrusts into explicit coding and signal processing algorithms with polynomial complexity in the network size, for resource-efficient multiflow multihop communication. The research can broadly impact the wireless industry by generating new ideas that will power the design of future generations of wireless networks. The project also includes a dedicated educational plan to recruit and train under-represented minorities in this field.",

Wireless is by far the preferred access because of its flexibility and seamless connectivity. In the past decade, wireless networks have evolved and dramatically improved, both in terms of the infrasturcture and in terms of the computation power, storage, and functionality of user devices. Due ot the enormous data volumes generated by modern user devices, such as smartphones and tablets, the current wireless network infrasturcure is under great stress. While need for more ``wireless bandwidth'' is usually addressed by releasing more spectrum and deploying more base stations, we argue that this answer just throws ``more of the same'' resource at the problem, and is in general not a viable and scalable approach in the long-term. In contrast, this project has developed a fundamental information theoretic understanding of wireless networks in the general multi-flow multi-hop case. Multi-flow means a network able to support simultaneous multiple communication sessions between different pairs of end-users (source-destination pairs). Multi-flow means that such communication sessions can take place through the transmission of intermediate nodes, acting as relays. The fundamental questions of interference management and relaying (cooperation) schemes have been addressed in the project, laying down the theoretical principles of novel netwokr architecture design, supported by a rigorous information theoretic understanding of the underlying problems and models. We have used the lens of informaiton theory, initiated by Claude E. Shannon in 1948, since this has been proved, through more than half a century of mathematical investigation and engineering design, to be the right framework to understand the fundamental limits of reliable communications in networks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The broader impact of this project is reflected in a number of landmark publications, in the most prestigious and high impact-factor journals in the area of communications, information theory, and networking, laying down the design principles and the fundamental limits of multi-flow multi-hop wireless networks. In particular, in this Project Outcome Report, we woudl like to stress a particularly interesting result obtained by the group led by PI G. Caire at the University of Southern California. This result concerns the achievable spectral efficiency of infrastructureless (also referred to as ``ad-hoc'' or device-to-device) networks, where devices are allowed to communicate directly with each other without the aid of base stations. This type of networks is very useful in applications such as car-to-car, smart infrastrucutre (sensor networks), Internet of Things, natural disasters and emergencies, where the infrastructure may be disrupted, and tactical military/law enforcement communications. We have considered a protocol called hierarchical cooperation, where clusters of nearby nodes act collectively as distributed antenna systems, and cooperate to relay information to far nodes across the network. This protocol has been analyzed in light of recent results (also developed by other PIs in the framework of this project) on the optimality conditions for treating interference as noise. In a nuttshell, we can use the condition of optimality of terating interference as noise in order to optimize the ``reuse distance'', i.e., the distance at which the same spectrum can be reused without significantly impairing the cooperative distributed MIMO transmission. Using this new optimization, we were able to improve the network spectral efficiency by more than one order of magnitude (a factor 10x) with respect to conventional schemes such as multi-hop routing and non-optimized cooperation. This means, for example, that the new network design can support 10 times more devices at the same rate of current solutions, or 10 times faster communication, for networks with the same size of current solutions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/18/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Giuseppe&nbsp;Caire</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1161801/1161801_10160334_1503060060914_FIG13--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1161801/1161801_10160334_1503060060914_FIG13--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Spectral efficiency\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1161801/1161801_10160334_1503060060914_FIG13--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Spectral efficiency\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Spectral efficiency as a function of the network size for different multi-hop multi-flow schemes.
