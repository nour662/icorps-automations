 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop and analyze novel discontinuous Galerkin (DG) \r\nmethods for solving partial differential equations arising from various application areas. The DG \r\nmethod is a class of finite element methods using completely discontinuous piecewise polynomial \r\nspace for the numerical solution and the test functions. Those robust, compact, locally \r\nconservative methods can treat arbitrarily unstructured meshes and are ideal for hp-adaptive \r\nstrategies. The good properties of the scheme call for further research in areas that are \r\ntraditionally not solved by DG methods. In this grant proposal, the PI plans to conduct research \r\nin the following directions: (1) a positivity-preserving DG method for solving the kinetic \r\nequations, including the Boltzmann equations and Vlasov equations, (2) application of the \r\nproposed method to solar cell/semiconductor device simulations and plasma physics, (3) a novel \r\nDG solver for the Hamilton-Jacobi equations and its applications in control problems with state \r\nconstraints.    \r\n \r\nThe proposed activity lies between algorithm development, analysis and applications.  \r\nDeveloping robust, high-order accurate, cost-efficient  numerical algorithms for kinetic models \r\nand control problem is very challenging, not only because of the high dimensionality of such \r\nmodels, but also because of the fact that a deep understanding of the underlying physics is \r\nrequired. The eventual goal is to produce solvers that are  computationally efficient and suit the \r\nneed for applications. The PI's work arises from the computational demand of real world \r\napplications. Many ideas developed in this proposal will have straightforward applications and \r\nimpacts in semiconductor device simulations, high-efficiency fuel cell modeling, control problems \r\nand plasma physics. The PI actively interacts  with students and faculty members in mathematics, \r\nphysics, electrical engineering and chemistry departments.  In addition, the PI will integrate the \r\nproject with the training of  graduate students in order to communicate in a broader context.",
