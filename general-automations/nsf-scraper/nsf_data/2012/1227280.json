These are in turn central issues for macroeconomic policy, as the 2008 financial crisis as well as the ongoing European sovereign debt crisis has shown. Understanding these relationships is therefore of first-order importance.  The proposed research seeks to make a contribution to that end, pursuing three projects in particular. The first project provides a new method for estimating macroeconomic models, when their asset pricing properties are the center of attention. As a particular application, a model with habit formation is investigated, thereby deepening our understanding for the scope as well as the role of particular features of this important class of model to replicate asset pricing and macroeconomic facts in an uncertain environment. This project will deepen our understanding about how economies react to risks at the macro level.  The second project investigates Epstein-Zin preferences, a second important approach in macroeconomic models to explain asset pricing and business cycle facts. The project will provide a clarification of key features of these models and to provide a useful benchmark for models with more elaborate features or solution methods. The third project is motivated by the current sovereign debt crisis in the European monetary union. It should prove useful for thinking about the underlying dynamics as well as for analyzing various policy options and their consequences.",

The Award amount was 282,069 $.  Support began in September 2012, and was granted for three years.  The goal of the work funded with this award was to investigate the following questions.  What is the role of macroeconomic risks?  How can one ensure that estimated macroeconomic models yield reasonable asset price implications?  What are the issues, risks and consequences of potential bailouts in a monetary union, plagued by a sovereign debt crisis?\n\nAdditional themes emerged, while research progressed.  In particular, what are the macroeconomic risks generating the additional risk premia observed for stocks in the health industry?  How did the non-agency mortgage backed securities ultimately perform, which were seen as imposing a huge risk on the financial system and the macroeconomy in the 2008 financial crisis?   And how can we account for the remarkably stable inflation, post 2008? \n\nResults:\n\nThe research has resulted in several papers, listed below, implementing much of the promised agenda.  The first project resulted in the publication listed below as #5, providing a method for estimating stochastic macroeconomic models, when incorporating risk pricing. Such models should be of great value for central banks and anyone interested in modeling both macroeconomic developments and asset prices.  Papers #1, #2, #3 and #8 are the outcomes from the project concerning sovereign default risk, demonstrating in particular, when an entity such as a common central bank may or may not buy sovereign bonds at prices engineered to prevent a sovereign default.  In a nutshell, if this is about \"picking the right equilibrium\", then this is a benign policy, but it is not, if it amounts to a bailout.  This perspective has led to an expert testimonial at the German constitutional court in 2013, by the principal investigator.\n\nThe risk premia in health sectors has been found to be due to the risk of government intervention, see paper #6. The Econometrica publication, joint with Koijen  and Philipson, carefully demonstrates this source and calculates the impact of eliminating this risk on the performance of the health sector and health R&amp;D.  Nonresidential mortgage backed securities, rated AAA, were found to perform better than many would have been led to believe, given the conventional narrative for 2008, as shown in the draft paper by Ospina and myself, see paper #9: this project is yet incomplete and may need further funding for full completion.  As for accounting for the inflationary developments post 2008, and in particular the lack of deflation, it turns out that a pre-crisis model suggests that it is the same macroeconomic risks that drove it as it drove it before 2008, see paper #7.  One can see this as good news or bad news: the 2008 crisis may not have necessitated new models for inflation, but our general lack of what drives inflation should be.\n\nResults: Publications (in sequence of publication, followed by R&amp;R?s and drafts\n\n1.       \"Outright Monetary Transactions und Target2\", Wirtschaftsdienst 2013, vol. 7, 443-444.
