Specific objectives are:\r\nO1. To evaluate and improve parameterizations of heat and salt fluxes due to double-diffusive convection (DDC) including the sensitivity of DDC heat fluxes to added velocity shear (e.g., mean flow, tides);\r\nO2. To map the spatial distribution of DDC parameters using all available eastern Arctic microstructure, Ice-Tethered Profiler (ITP) and Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) data for 2007 and 2009;\r\nO3. To estimate the spatial distribution of velocity shear using a 3D baroclinic, coupled ocean/sea-ice model including tide forcing;\r\nO4. To evaluate the relative roles of turbulent mixing and DDC processes in shaping EB upward fluxes;\r\nO5. To estimate impact of DDC and feedbacks with stratification and shear on the hydrographic structure of the EB (via modeling); and\r\nO6. To estimate the lateral intrusive heat fluxes, assessing their role in ventilating the ocean interior.\r\nThe PIs propose advanced analyses of a suite of existing hydrographic data with fine vertical resolution ? microstructure, CTD, ITP and MacLane moored profilers ? taking advantage of the unique EB dataset collected over the recent decade by the international community. A high-resolution 3D regional ocean model with active sea ice will be used to quantify upper ocean shear from mean flow, eddies and tides, and provide a tool for investigating sensitivity of modeled fluxes to parameterizations of DDC, shear-induced turbulence, and DDC/shear coupling.",

However, there is large natural variability in the Arctic climate system and the ability to model complex coupling between these components is still insufficient for reliable prediction of the future state of the climate system. This study focused specifically on deeper understanding and quantifying of vertical fluxes of heat, salt and momentum in the intermediate and upper layers of the eastern Arctic Ocean. The major challenge was to figure out how changes in ocean heat flux into the Arctic from subpolar regions can affect the sea ice cover?

More accurate parameterizations increase the reliability of model-based &nbsp;projections of future climate under various scenarios of natural and anthropogenic large-scale impacts. Key scientific results of the accomplished study may be summarized in the following statements.
