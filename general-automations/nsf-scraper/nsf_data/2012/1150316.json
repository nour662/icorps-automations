 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will develop a systematic analytical solution to accurately design, build, and evaluate corrugated-core lignocellulosic sandwich panels for building envelope components as a potential solution for net zero energy construction. Components of a building envelope influence its structural and hygrothermal performance and determine a buildings consumption of operational energy; alternative designs and materials that reduce a building's operational energy will meet our nation's goal of market-ready, net-zero buildings. Model based on composite plate theory will account for bidirectional undulations of a corrugated-core in designing a lignocellulosic sandwich panel. The model will define the forming limits for designing the complex core of a sandwich panel. Project will also evaluate fullsize sandwich panel structural and hygrothermal performance for residential wall applications. The long-term educational goal of this CAREER project is to prepare new generation of engineers cognizant of sustainable building materials from lignocellulosic fibers and equipped with the knowledge to design and manufacture bio-based composite products for building envelopes in a net zero energy construction.\r\n\r\nForty percent of US primary energy was consumed in the buildings sector, of which homes accounted for 54 percent and commercial buildings accounted for 46 percent. Residential buildings contribute 17 percent to the total US greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions measured in carbon dioxide equivalents, of which space heating and cooling account for 37 percent of GHG emissions. The US federal government has a goal of market-ready, net-zero energy commercial buildings by the year 2015 and residential buildings by 2030. The study proposes to advance the science of sustainable buildings through new design concepts using panelized systems for residential construction to meet structural and energy requirements of the building codes. Performance of multi-functional, lightweight, 3-D lignocellulosic panels will be superior to currently used materials as building envelope components and allow innovative panelized construction which will reduce the consumption of operational energy of our future homes and stimulate the home building industry. Considering an increased demand for green building materials (13 percent annual growth predicted in next five years), value-added products that complement commodity-based infrastructure will contribute to revitalizing segments of the forest products industry.",

Forty percent of U.S. primary energy is consumed in the buildings sector, of which homes account for 54%.&nbsp; Residential buildings contribute 17% to the total U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions measured in carbon dioxide equivalents, of which space heating and cooling account for 37% of GHG emissions. Therefore, in designing and manufacturing components of a building envelope (i.e., walls, floors, and roofs), one should consider the requirements for structural capacity based on the building codes of the region, as well as the embodied energy of manufacturing the components and the impact on the operational energy during the serviced life of a building. The embodied energy of a building, energy consumed by all of the processes associated with the production of a building, is reported to be significantly lower with the use of renewable building material such as wood. If the capacity of a building envelope to resist the heat flow (i.e., higher R-value) is increased, then the operational energy of a building can be reduced significantly during its service life.</p>\n<p>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, using model-based design, engineered a corrugated-core wood-based composite sandwich panel (Figure 1) for use in building envelopes. Structural and hygrothermal performance of these composite panels for residential wall construction were evaluated. On average, the bending stiffness of these sandwich panels is three times that of a commercially produced oriented strand board (OSB) panel of equivalent thickness, while utilizing 50% less material. Multiple corrugated cores (Figure 2) can also be used to prefabricate walls, roofs, or floors sandwich panels to replace traditional onsite construction practices. The cavities created by the corrugated geometry of the cores can then be filled with insulation material to improve their R-value. Compared to common sheathing materials, such as OSB and plywood, normalized R-value of sandwich panels with foam (Figure 3) increased by over 140%. Prefabricated thick panels with multiple cores and cavities filled with foam will significantly improve their R-value and help to lower the operational energy of buildings.</p>\n<p>The educational goal of this project was to increase the awareness of students about the manufacturing of wood composites and their use as structural materials. Throughout the project, a cohort of high school and college students were involved in research-based experiential learning. Assisting the Principal Investigator and the graduate student with research enabled the students to have a better understanding of the engineering concepts learned in their classes, and a deeper appreciation for renewable materials, such as wood. This experience also increased their confidence in problem-solving and conducting independent as well as team research. Assisting with a variety of tasks throughout the project improved their knowledge about the manufacturing of composite panels with wood materials, performance testing standards, and evaluation of their properties and performance. A project undertaken by thirteen mechanical engineering students over three semesters resulted in a semi-automated forming machine (Figure 4) that was critical to manufacturing wood-based panels that were uniform in thickness and density.</p>\n<p>In this project, low-quality small diameter ponderosa and lodgepole pine logs were utilized to produce wood strands for the production of panels. Ability to convert low-quality underutilized small diameter trees would help in offsetting treatment costs to sustainably manage our forests and improve our forests' health. Hazardous fuel treatment costs were reported to range between $35 to $1000 per acre depending on the volume of trees removed, terrain, and type of operation; for example, in 2001 two million acres were treated at a cost of ~$200 per acre. A U.S. Forest Service report on the strategic assessment of forest biomass and fuel reduction treatments in western states estimated that at least 28 million acres of forest in this region need some type of mechanical treatment to reduce hazardous fuel loading. If value-added options to utilize large volumes of biomass from these treatments to mitigate forest fires are not developed, the Forest Service will be spending a significant amount of money in tackling forest fires every year. Considering an increased demand for green building materials (13% annual growth predicted in next five years), value-added products that complement commodity-based infrastructure will contribute to revitalizing segments of the forest products industry and improve our forest health.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/26/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Vikram&nbsp;Yadama</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150316/1150316_10144030_1540600891007_Sandwichpanel--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150316/1150316_10144030_1540600891007_Sandwichpanel--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150316/1150316_10144030_1540600891007_Sandwichpanel--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Wood strand sandwich panel with a corrugated core.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vikram Yadama</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vikram&nbsp;Yadama</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150316/1150316_10144030_1540600990379_SandwichPanelwithmiltiplecores--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150316/1150316_10144030_1540600990379_SandwichPanelwithmiltiplecores--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150316/1150316_10144030_1540600990379_SandwichPanelwithmiltiplecores--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Wood strand sandwich panel with four cores for use as a wall panel</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vikram Yadama</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vikram&nbsp;Yadama</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150316/1150316_10144030_1540601083541_FoamedSandwichSpecimen--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150316/1150316_10144030_1540601083541_FoamedSandwichSpecimen--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150316/1150316_10144030_1540601083541_FoamedSandwichSpecimen--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Wood strand sandwich panel filled with insulation foam.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vikram Yadama</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vikram&nbsp;Yadama</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150316/1150316_10144030_1540601770513_Wood-strandPreform--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150316/1150316_10144030_1540601770513_Wood-strandPreform--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1150316/1150316_10144030_1540601770513_Wood-strandPreform--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Semi-automated contraption designed by mechanical engineering undergraduate students to form a mat of wood strands for subsequent consolidation into a panel.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vikram Yadama</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vikram&nbsp;Yadama</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
