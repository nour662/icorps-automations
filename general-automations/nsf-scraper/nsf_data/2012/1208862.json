 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project is a core project under the auspices of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and is co-sponsored by the international Commission on Atmospheric Composition and Global Pollution (iCACGP).  IGAC's mission is to coordinate and foster atmospheric chemistry research towards a sustainable world. IGAC's priorities and activities are guided by an international volunteer Scientific Steering Committee (SSC). The IGAC International Project Office (IPO) is responsible for fostering implementation of the SSC priorities by facilitating international collaboration in field campaigns, organizing international efforts to address specific scientific issues, and coordinating the preparation of synthesis and assessment documents. This award through the Atmospheric Chemistry Program is NSF's component of larger funding package provided in collaboration with NASA's Tropospheric Chemistry Program and NOAA's Atmospheric Composition and Climate Program to support the IGAC IPO for the next three years. These funds will cover operating costs for the IPO including salaries, supplies, computer/web page maintenance costs, and travel expenses. Funds will also support travel for early career scientist and scientists in developing countries to participate in workshops and conferences. \r\n\r\nIGAC contributes to the international atmospheric chemistry community, the wider earth system research community, and stakeholders both by advancing atmospheric chemistry research and contributing to understanding earth system sustainability science. It also builds scientific capacity globally by engaging early-career scientists and scientists from developing countries through travel grants to IGAC sponsored workshops, meetings, and conferences and by featuring their work in the IGAC newsletter. IGAC broadly communicates results of atmospheric chemistry research to the scientific community, policy makers, and the broader public through its newsletter, web site, email announcements, and conference presentations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFor 25 years IGAC has provided the intellectual leadership and created networks to foster international scientific collaborations supporting atmospheric chemistry research toward a sustainable world.  During the July 2012-June 2015 IGAC IPO grant, IGAC set the foundation for the atmospheric chemistry community to look beyond its impact on understanding Earth system science towards cultivating the knowledge required to respond effectively to the challenges and opportunities of global change and sustainability.  IGAC promotes the philosophy that the ability of the community to branch out to the global change and sustainability communities is only as strong as the roots of its tree, i.e. fundamental atmospheric chemistry research.  Therefore, IGAC has established a strong emphasis on fundamental atmospheric chemistry research by writing a New Directions article in Atmospheric Environment [Abbatt et al., 2013] and by sponsoring/endorsing workshops and including a session at its biennial science conference on fundamentals of atmospheric chemistry research.  On the other end of the spectrum, IGAC and IGBP have led an initiative on Air Pollution &amp; Climate: A Science-Policy Dialogue that aims to communicate the scientific linkages between air pollution and climate change to stakeholders, and to co-design a strategic framework to integrate air pollution and climate change into policy process with stakeholders.  In between the ends of this spectrum, IGAC has provided the intellectual leadership to foster the Interdisciplinary Biomass Burning Initiative (IBBI) with iLEAPS and WMO to coordinate research on biomass burning, has worked with SPARC to bridge the tropospheric and stratospheric atmospheric chemistry communities to work towards developing models with a \"one atmosphere\" approach through the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI), and has promoted the development of an open emissions data system for both the science and policy communities through the Global Emissions Initiative (GEIA), amongst other efforts.
