 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a system\r\nfor locating a smartphone inside a building very accurately, helping users\r\nnavigate and find items of interest indoors, where current systems do not\r\nfunction. Building on academic research from MIT, the system will use\r\nexisting Wi-Fi signals combined with motion sensors and map data to produce\r\nestimates with a 90th percentile accuracy of 1-3 m. This is significantly\r\nmore accurate than the currently available systems, which are accurate to\r\nwithin 5-10 metres in the mean and worse in the 90th percentile. It uses\r\nexisting Wi-Fi signals, which means the system does not require additional\r\nhardware in most buildings. The system incorporates three novel technologies:\r\n1) a novel training system that uses motion sensors and map data to\r\ndramatically reduce the time it takes to calibrate the system in a new\r\nbuilding compared to existing technologies, 2) a new location matching\r\nalgorithm that fuses motion sensors and WiFi signals to improve the accuracy\r\nand reliability of location estimates from limited training data, and 3) a\r\nsystem to predict the accuracy using the available Wi-Fi access points, to\r\ndetermine if new hardware or additional training is required. All three\r\ntechnologies are key competitive advantages essential to bring this\r\ntechnology to market.  This proposal will develop a Wi-Fi-based indoor\r\nlocation system that is not only accurate, but also easy and cheap to deploy.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that smartphones,\r\nthat have become indispensable tools for locating buildings and businesses in a\r\ncity, can now also be used to show a user his/her location on an indoor map,\r\nand guide them to find what they are looking for inside large buildings where\r\npeople get lost all the time today --- while looking for points of interest\r\nlike ticket counters, products on shelves, airline gates, and stores. InFix's\r\napproach of using existing WiFi beacons, ubiquitous everywhere today, has the\r\nhighest potential to achieve scale and reach, and realize the vision of\r\n\"precise location everywhere\". This is in contrast to previous academic,\r\nresearch and commercial efforts that all require installing specialized\r\nhardware. Infix will license this technology to space owners, to integrate into\r\ntheir smartphone applications. As the map and location database grow, the\r\ncompany will allow third-parties to build their own innovative applications.",
