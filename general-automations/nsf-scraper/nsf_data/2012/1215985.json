 "awd_abstract_narration": "An individual's preferences can be complicated.  The project investigates whether people's preferences do, in fact, conform to the CP-net (conditional preference network) formalism, how such preferences can be combined according to different voting methods, and how vulnerable those methods are to manipulation or \"strategic voting.\"  Finally, the very large corpus of preference data from the Netflix Challenge is used to build statistical models of the efficiency of manipulation algorithms and to compare the performance of different consensus methods.\r\n\r\nLaboratory experiments will check whether people exhibit preferences that can be modeled by CP-nets. The project extends ideas from aggregation in Bayesian networks (models of conditional probabilities) to aggregation in CP-nets (models of conditional preferences).\r\n\r\nThe team investigates how statistical inference from noisy data relates to or interacts with strategic manipulability and bribery. The project extends behavioral social choice and computational social choice on voting systems, and the manipulation thereof, from preferences expressed as ratings, rankings, or subsets to preferences expressed as CP-nets.\r\n\r\nThe team investigates the performance of voting methods and the efficiency of manipulation schemes on real preference data from the Netflix challenge data set.  These data, namely hundreds of thousands of (slightly perturbed) personal rankings of movies, were released several years ago for data-mining purposes.  One can extract individual \"elections\" based on the rankings of a small set of movies, evaluate and compare various aggregation methods and empirically characterize voting scenarios that are especially susceptible or especially resilient to strategic manipulation.\r\n\r\nAmong the broader impacts of the research, beyond the integration and cross-fertilization of several distinct research areas spanning several scientific disciplines, are the development of more adequate individual and collective decision making tools, that will help individuals, groups, organizations, and society to improve decision making.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe underlying questions explored under this grant are about computational representations and reasoning about preferences.  This included questions about how to represent and reason with an individual's preferences when those preferences are conditional.   For instance, when choosing, say, a cell phone, preferences about size might be dependent on the quality of games available and the cost of a data plan sufficient for streaming video.  (I might prefer the larger phone only if I can afford to stream video on it or I want to play sufficiently complex games on it.) The research also looked at preference aggregation, both in the form of voting systems and of more complex representations of group preferences.\n\nGenerally, there is a trade off between the expressivity of preference representations and the computational complexity of reasoning with those representations.  When we allow preferences about features to be conditioned on the value of other features, we introduce complexity to the problem of comparing two items and determining which is preferred.  We began work on heuristic algorithms for the comparison problem for preferences represented as conditional preference networks (CP-nets).   We have also developed algorithms for generating all CP-nets of a given size, or uniformly (or approximately uniformly, for larger instances) randomly generating a set of CP-nets.  This allows us to generate \"profiles\" of preferences, so we can experimentally explore properties of CP-nets and of voting algorithms based on CP-nets.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Dr. Regenwetter, Department of Psychology, University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, has been setting up an experiment to determine whether individuals make choices (mostly) consistent with a CP-net, or perhaps a small set of CP-nets.\n\nIn work with Dr. Francesca Rossi and her group at the University of Padua (Italy), and Dr. Nicholas Mattei, University of New South Wales and NICTA (Australia), we looked at a probabilistic model of CP-nets (PCP-nets) that compactly represents sets of CP-nets.  We showed that there are different notions of \"best item\" for such CP-nets, corresponding to different voting systems, and presented algorithms for computing them.  We also looked at the comparison problem and developed heuristic algorithms for that as well.\n\nWe looked at another probabilistic model of voting systems based on round-robin tournaments, where each team plays each other team.  We have proved that the following problem is computationally complex:  given the probabilities for each team to beat each other team, to compute the probability that a given team wins as many (or more) games than any other.   It is surprising that this is so hard, given that it is the sort of problem that sports sites seem to compute.  However, we have provided tractable approximation algorithms for this problem.\n\nWe looked at the benefits and drawbacks of using data such as the Netflix Data Set to reason about voting systems.  For instance, we can show that certain voting paradoxes occur very rarely, when we treat movie ratings as votes.  On the other hand, we can show that the way we handle missing data (movies not ranked by an individual) has significant effects on the outcomes of votes, and on other statistical patterns of vote profiles.\n\nFinally, with Dr. Mattei, Dr. Jerome Lang, Dauphin University (France) and Dr. Patrice Perny, Marie and Pierre Curie University (France), we introduced a new family of voting systems, Rank Dependent Scoring Rules (RDSRs).  We showed that RDSRs, which generalize so-called Olympic voting (where the top and bottom scores for each contestant are dropped), are more fair than more common systems.\n\nDr. Mattei, who has been serving as a consultant on this grant, has developed and posted a library of preference data and related algorithms at PrefLib.org.  This will have the broadest impact on the study of preferences and voting systems of all our work.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this work li..."
