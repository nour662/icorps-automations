 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to create a framework for integrated policy and engineering design considering multiple goals of policy makers, stakeholders, and dynamic stability. The research objective will be achieved by establishing domain-independent multilevel design techniques through the integration of mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints, constructs from multi-objective optimization, games with vector payoffs, and stability theories. The framework will be validated through the design of market-oriented feed-in-tariff policies for smart electric grids, accounting for economic, environmental, technical, and energy-security objectives. Domain-specific models will be developed using techniques such as continuation power flow analysis and volatility analysis. The research will result in a general framework that can be applied to other complex systems that require the integrated consideration of technical design and policy decisions. Deliverables include a computational framework for integrated policy and engineering design, extension of existing mathematical constructs to multi-objective problems, and specific insights into the design of feed-in-tariff policies.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will enable computational policy design using multilevel design techniques. The applications include large-scale complex systems such as energy, transportation and telecommunication infrastructure. The results will be disseminated through industrial partners, university?s extension energy program, journal publications and conference presentations. The outreach efforts are designed to increase public awareness through local science centers, to support local communities through design-oriented service-learning projects, and to increase the participation of women and minorities through undergraduate research. Project outcomes will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate courses. High school students will be engaged through existing design competitions to educate them about engineering, energy, and policy-related issues.",
