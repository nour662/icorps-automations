 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grant in Engineering (BRIGE) grant provides funding to quantitatively assess the loss of efficiency that occurs in humanitarian and public health logistics systems in the absence of a centralized decision-making authority and to discover mechanisms to mitigate this impact by optimally designing system parameters. Centralized decision-making in such settings is unlikely, but decentralized system outcomes can be poor. This research will examine settings in which individuals choose a facility for service, for example, to pick up needed supplies after a disaster or be vaccinated against an infectious disease. Models will be created by integrating concepts from game theory and optimization to represent decisions of decentralized agents, who act according to different objectives but whose decisions impact overall system outcomes. New theoretical performance bounds will be developed to compare the performance of the decentralized system to a best-case system in which a centralized planner can assign individuals to facilities. Efficient algorithms will be sought to solve the decentralized problem. Finally, mechanisms will be designed to coordinate the decentralized system, or ensure that its performance more closely approximates a centralized one.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to the creation of new optimization and game theory tools with significant potential to inform decision-making in humanitarian and public health logistics systems. The research will highlight opportunities for greater efficiency and effectiveness in these settings, improving the utilization of scarce resources and outcomes for affected populations. Analysis of the proposed models will also advance theoretical understanding of more general decentralized networks. The proposed research activities are integrated with a broadening participation plan that will create pathways to engineering careers for pre-college and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups by engaging these students in outreach and research activities that illustrate ways that engineers make a difference in society.",

The choice is based on a utility function that incorporates travel time to the facility, waiting time, and the relative importance that the individual places on these parameters. We model this system using optimization and game theory.\n\n The broadening participation objective of this project is to create pathways that lead to engineering careers for students from underrepresented groups by engaging undergraduate students in humanitarian logistics research and by involving pre-college students in hands-on activities that illustrate ways that engineers make a difference in society.\n\n \n\nThe project has three major goals:\n\n1.  Advance understanding of decentralized humanitarian logistics systems by answering fundamental questions about the complexity of computing decentralized solutions, the quality of those solutions, and the potential to mitigate the inefficiency of decentralization through coordination mechanisms.\n\n2.  Engage undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in research.\n\n3.  Introduce middle and high school students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to humanitarian applications of industrial engineering.\n \nThe project resulted in the following significant outcomes:\n\nWe proved that the decentralized system of interest can be arbitrarily inefficient in general.  We also provide multiple bounds on best- and worst-case decentralized system costs as functions of problem parameters.  \nOur work identified new coordination mechanisms under which the central optimal solution is an equilibrium solution for this class of decentralized systems, as well as an optimization model to identify mechanism values.  Together, these make it possible to create tools for managing decentralized systems to mitigate inefficiencies.\nAn education game, HERO: Humanitarian Engineers Responding Optimally, and accompanying instructional materials was developed for outreach events with middle and high school students to introduce them to humanitarian applications of industrial engineering and provide information about ways they can prepare now to study engineering in the future.\nHERO: Humanitarian Engineers Responding Optimally was delivered to approximately 108 middle and high school students (41% female, 58.3% from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups).  More specifically, outreach participants\u00c6 self-reported racial/ethnic group identities were as follows: African-American: 35.2%; Asian/Pacific Islander: 9.3%; Caucasian: 32.4%; Hispanic/Latino(a): 28.7%; Native American: 5.6%; other: 1.2%.  (Note: values do not sum to 100% because participants could select multiple responses.)  \nSurvey results showed that participating in outreach activities that illustrate humanitarian applications of engineering can increase middle and high school students\u00c6 perception that engineers make a difference in people\u00c6s lives.  Prior to participating in an outreach event that included HERO: Humanitarian Engineers Responding Optimally, 39.8% of participants identified, \"help people,\" as something that engineers do.  After the event, 60.3% of participants selected that response.  More students also identified helping people as a reason that they would choose to become an engineer (31.5% in the pre-survey, 46.2% in the post-survey).\nResearch assistants (one Ph.D. student, one MS stu..."
