The CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SFS) universities and colleges represent a large fraction of the national capacity to produce a potentially very large and diversified cybersecurity workforce. In part motivated to build programs to achieve the Center of Academic Excellence designation or an SFS award, these universities and colleges collectively have a capacity to train or educate many more people than the roughly 1500 US citizens and SFS graduates who have committed to at least two years to work for the federal government and a few other designated organizations.",
