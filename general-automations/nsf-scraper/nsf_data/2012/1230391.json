 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evidence suggests that existing STEM faculty workshops have been reasonably effective in meeting the goals of introducing faculty to pedagogical practices well-grounded in discipline-specific education research and motivating faculty to try these ideas and materials to enhance student learning. Current workshops, however, reach only a small fraction of STEM faculty in colleges and universities and they offer a wide range of models for faculty development. This project is to organize and hold a national symposium focusing on the role of scientific societies in STEM faculty professional development workshops. The symposium will bring together the leaders of these workshops to find a set of best practices for these workshops and discuss ways of extending these workshops to a larger fraction of STEM faculty members. It is an important attempt to catalyze large scale adoption of effective teaching practices in this country and will contribute to the transformation of undergraduate STEM education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project, \"The Role of Scientific Societies in STEM Faculty Workshops,\" addressed the problem that most new college and university science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty members begin their teaching careers with no formal training in pedagogy and student learning.  While these faculty members are experts in their respective fields, they lack experience with and knowledge of research on how students learn and the pedagogical methods that education research over the past few decades has shown to be effective in helping a diverse student population learn STEM material.  As a result, their teaching, particularly at the beginning of their faculty careers, may not be as effective as they and their students would like.  To address these issues, several scientific societies have organized faculty professional development workshops for STEM faculty members to enhance their awareness of effective pedagogical methods and the research evidence that indicates the effectiveness of those methods.\n\n \n\nThe project hosted two meetings: (1) a meeting (May, 2012) of the leaders of STEM faculty professional development workshops hosted by scientific societies and the presidents of those societies and (2) a meeting (September, 2014) of the leaders of those workshops and leaders of undergraduate STEM education initiatives funded by the Association of American Universities, whose STEM education project is supported by the Helmsley Charitable Trust.  The latter meeting was also attended by leaders from American Public and Land-Grant Universities, the Association of American Colleges and Universities, and several funding agencies.\n\n \n\nThe first meeting resulted in a report describing seven faculty professional development workshops and the research that has documented both the successes of those workshops and areas in which the workshops can be improved.  That report has been widely distributed to scientific societies, funding agencies, and college and university faculty members.\n\n \n\nThe second meeting, supported by this grant and by the National Science Foundation grant 1344418 (\"Integration of Strategies that Support Undergraduate Education in STEM [ISSUES]\"), led to a report with recommendations on how the participants from the scientific society workshops can be connected to and supported by their colleagues who are active in STEM education initiatives on their home campuses and by the Teaching/Learning Centers on those campuses.  Such connections should help both the workshop participants as they implement what they have learned in the workshops and the local projects, which can draw upon the expertise of the workshop participants as they build the faculty infrastructure to sustain their local programs. The meeting also laid the groundwork for continuing collaborative efforts among the scientific societies who were involved in the ISSUES project. As a result, the project should lead to significant enhancements of the effectiveness of undergraduate STEM education.   The report from the second meeting is being distributed to STEM faculty workshop leaders, higher education organizations, funding agencies, and college and university STEM faculty members.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert C Hilborn"
