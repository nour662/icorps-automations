 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will deliver a mobile payment\r\ncommunications infrastructure, mobile device apps for utilizing that payment infrastructure,\r\npoint-of-sale solutions for merchants that utilize the payment infrastructure, and will establish\r\nthe framework for a local advertising network. The mobile payment system takes advantage of\r\nthe speed of contemporary mobile devices to enable secure web-based transactions. This\r\npayment system revolutionizes payment by bypassing existing legacy credit and debit card\r\ninfrastructure. New security algorithms and models will be developed to enable the secure\r\ntransfer of banking information. The proposed payment system empowers consumers to control\r\nprivacy, security, and localization settings in their mobile payment apps. The local advertising\r\nnetwork changes the value proposition for both merchants and consumers with respect to ads and\r\ncoupons, creating an environment in which merchants ?push? ads to ?pulling? customers. The\r\nlocal advertisement network will fundamentally alter the way users think about localization,\r\nprivacy, and data anonymity.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the creation of a payment\r\nsystem that revolutionizes commerce. The system will dramatically reduce or eliminate payment\r\ninterchange fees for merchants, will move consumers much closer to the concept of a fully\r\ndigital wallet, and will create a new level of engagement between merchants and consumers that\r\nis mutually beneficial. Small, independent merchants will immediately realize many of the\r\nbenefits of the payment network. These merchants typically pay between $15,000 and $200,000\r\nannually in credit and debit card interchange fees. The proposed payment system will reduce or\r\neliminate these fees enabling business expansion and job creation. The payment system\r\neffectively creates local commerce zones where ?buying local? is implicitly strongly encouraged\r\nthrough in-network, in-app local advertising, coupons, and loyalty programs. The payment\r\nsystem includes seamless peer-to-peer digital funds transfers. The ultimate goal is a payment\r\nsystem to make all commerce - all transfers of funds - frictionless, fast, simple, and easy. The\r\nmobile commerce market is expected to grow from over $200B this year to over $600B by 2015.\r\nThe technology developed herein will be a vital driver of that growth.",
