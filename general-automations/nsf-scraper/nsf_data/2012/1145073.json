 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth scientists from Louisiana State University and the University of Florida are collaborating on an investigation of a unique segment of Precambrian (>550 million years old, m.y.o.) continental crust brought to the earth?s surface by the ~50 m.y.o. Sawtooth batholith in eastern Idaho. This crust is unique because it lies between some of the oldest crust in North America (exposed in SW Montana) and some of the most recent additions to the North American continent in western Idaho (Blue Mountains). This research will test a wide range of hypotheses for the formation and evolution of this crust: Is it an independent terrane accreted to North America in the recent past, or does it show geochemical ties to the old (>3000 m.y.o.) crust exposed in SW Montana? Does it record evidence of a ?vanished? episode of mountain building similar in age to the Grenville orogeny that formed much of eastern North America 1000 m.y. ago?  If accreted to North America in the Precambrian, does it provide insight the fragmentation of North America that occurred 500-700 m.y.o ago?  Specifically, the team will investigate the origin of metamorphosed sedimentary rocks that carry information about the nature of continental crust exposed at the time they were deposited.  The temperature and pressure history of this crust, which will constrain the time at which it was appended to North America and the mechanism by which it was appended.  Elemental abundances in the metamorphosed igneous rocks will give important clues to the environment in which they formed, while isotopic compositions will constrain the amount of new crust vs. recycled crust that is preserved.  A large fraction of the crust that lies between the Archean (>2500 m.y.o.) crust of SW Montana and the <200 m.y.o. crust of western Idaho is buried beneath younger rocks, making the Sawtooth terrane a very important window into crustal evolution in western North America.  \r\n\r\nThis research will be carried out by a team that includes members from underrepresented groups and women who will be trained in important quantitative techniques applicable across a range of STEM disciplines.  The team will also participate in the public-private partnership between LSU Geology & Geophysics and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (Geoscience Diversity Enrichment Program) that is focused on increasing STEM participation. The public will also benefit by our partnership with the Sawtooth National Recreational Area (U.S. Forest Service), leading to better educational materials distributed in the Sawtooth National Recreational Area.  In detail, this team (faculty and students, undergraduate and graduate) will employ and provide training in the following: 1) We will conduct U/Pb radiometric dating of zircons to determine original crystallization ages of igneous rocks and the origin of sediment deposited in protoliths to the metasedimentary rocks using laser ablation to sample individual crystals in the ICP-MS laboratory at the University of Florida; 2) Elemental analyses by a combination of x-ray fluorescence and ICP methods at the University of Florida; 3) The electron microprobe laboratory at LSU will be used to measure elemental abundances in individual minerals, which can then be used to determine the burial conditions and pressure-temperature path of the Sawtooth crust (thermobarometry);  4) U-Th-Pb (radiometric) dating of texturally and petrologically constrained monazite and titanite will provide a definitive age for the metamorphic event(s) recorded in the Sawtooth crust needed to develop Pressure-Temperature-time path(s) and determine the tectonic setting of metamorphism using facilities at the University of Florida and the University of Massachusetts; and 5) Measurement of K-Ar systematics (40Ar/39Ar) will help assess the most recent, post-metamorphic, thermal history of the terrain.  Students from both universities will cross-train in these techniques as part of their thesis and dissertation research, and will then be well prepared to meet the technologically challenging opportunities afforded members of the country?s STEM workforce.",

The project was a collaborative effort between faculty and students at the University of Florida and the Louisiana State University.  The SMC is exposed at high elevations (&gt;8,000?) in the Sawtooth Range of Idaho.  The complex contains a wide variety of metamorphic rocks that have been strongly deformed, metamorphosed to amphibolite-to-lower granulite facies (representing burial to mid-crustal temperatures and pressures), and partially melted.  The original rocks were largely sandstones, carbonate rocks (limestones and calcareous sandstones), and shales that represent deposition in a shallow-to-deep water transition typical of a passive margin environment.

In addition, granitic rocks of the much younger Idaho and Sawtooth batholiths now envelop the complex, but there is no evidence that any melt phases in the SMC were associated with either batholith, a surprising result.\n\nWe measured the U-Pb ages of individual detrital zircons using the laser ablation technique.  Zircons from metamorphosed quartzites and quartzofeldspathic rocks indicated two distinct populations. In one group, a few Paleozoic zircons were identified.  These zircons were considered detrital (i.e., not metamorphic), and thereby constrained the age of deposition of the original sedimentary rock to be Early Paleozoic, probably Ordovician at the latest. In the second group, the youngest detrital zircons were 1700 Ma.  Consequently, the original sedimentary rocks could have been deposited any time after 1700 Ma.  The origin or source of the zircons from each sedimentary rocks were evaluated by comparison to the ages of older basement in the region and to the ages of zircons from other better constrained sedimentary rocks to the south in the Great Basin, which are much less deformed and metamorphosed.  Both groups of zircons compared favorably with known Paleozoic sedimentary section along the Cordilleran miogeocline, and were likely deposited in the Early Paleozoic.  One unique aspect of the detrital zircon suites from the complex is that they both contain zircons with ages between 1000 and 1200 Ma.  Zircons of this age are widely distributed in the Cordillera beginning in the Neoproterozoic, and are most often ascribed to continent-wide river systems that carried these zircons from the Appalachians to the western U.S.  The ultimate conclusion that the SMC is comprised of metamorphosed Paleozoic sedimentary rocks is contrary to our original hypothesis, but justified by strict statistical comparison of the overall age patterns defined by over 1200 individual analyses of zircons from these rocks.  Efforts to define the times of metamorphism were unsuccessful due to low U contents in accessory minerals (e.g., titanite), recrystallization of the monazite due to fluids and the thermal affects of the two enclosing batholiths that reset all of the K-Ar systems.  Structural analyses, however, show strong similarities in mode of deformation and orientation of structural features to structures in the Western Idaho shear zone, a zone of intense deformation within the Salmon River suture, which separates Precambrian North American and a range of younger terranes accreted to the ancient Pacific margin in the Mesozoic.
