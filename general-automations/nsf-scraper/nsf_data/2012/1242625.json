 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin of dark matter is one of the major scientific questions of our time. The DAMA/LIBRA experiment at the Underground Laboratory at Gran Sasso, Italy (LNGS) has reported a signal that is claimed to be evidence for dark matter in the form of elementary particles called Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). However, their results seem to be in conflict with other experiments that have searched for dark matter with null results. The situation will be unclear until an independent experiment with Sodium Iodide (NaI) detectors is done with lower background.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide funds to develop low-background sodium iodide scintillation crystals for a sensitive dark matter search. Prior research, which was supported by an NSF EAGER grant, focused on the purification of precursor materials that are used for producing NaI powder. The activities planned with this award will be to a) address issues concerning the development of high purity low background NaI scintillation crystals grown with the high purity NaI powder and b) develop a sensitive method to measure the potassium radioactivity in the crystals to verify the very low levels needed for dark matter research. A possible second phase of research will be to deploy an array of such detectors in a low background environment that will allow a search for WIMP dark matter with lower background and higher sensitivity than achieved in the DAMA/LIBRA experiment.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: Understanding the nature of dark matter would impact many fields of science from the largest scale of astronomy to the smallest scale of elementary particle physics. It is a mysterious form of matter that will connect to all fields once it is understood. In addition, the technology developed here, with demands on ultrapure materials, will benefit other fields that rely on such materials, such as semiconductors and nanotechnology devices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF SABRE Award 1242625\n\nProject Outcomes Report\n\nOverview:\n\nThe goal of SABRE is to make a direct test of the DAMA-LIBRA data which indicate evidence for a dark matter signal with sodium iodide detectors.  The first step, which is funded by this award, is a \"proof of principle\" demonstration of new NaI(Tl) crystals with lower background than achieved by DAMA-LIBRA.  The crystals will be tested for 40K and other internal radioactive impurities by direct counting in a shielded liquid scintillator veto at the LNGS underground laboratory in Italy.   \n\n\nMajor Outcomes:\n\nNew crystals were developed in collaboration with Sigma Aldrich for development of low radioactivity \"Astrograde\" sodium iodide powder, and with Radiation Monitoring Devices for methods to grow high-purity crystals.   The result of this collaboration is a 2-kg crystal with potassium concentration of 9 +/- 1 ppb. The measurements of potassium and other chemical elements at trace levels in the crystal were independently carried out with ICP-MS spectroscopy at Seastar Chemicals, and at Pacific Northwest National Laboratories.  The low potassium content is first crystal produced with a lower potassium contamination than the average 13 ppb achieved for the crystals of the DAMA-LIBRA experiment. Improvement in crucible radio-purity, purification of powder, and crystal growing methods are still underway for production of a 5-kg detector for counting tests. \nGood progress was achieved on the development of the SABRE liquid scintillator veto and electronics.   Software for the SABRE DAQ electronics was tested at Princeton taking signals from a crystal and PMT inside the air-filled liquid scintillator veto vessel, together with coincident signals from ten 8-inch PMTs mounted on ports of the veto vessel. Lumirror reflector was placed on the inside surface of the vessel. Test were carried out to characterize the trigger system and to measure the light-yield produced by gamma rays from a radioactive source that produced coincident signal in the NaI(Tl) crystal and a small vial of liquid scintillator placed near the crystal.  After obtaining satisfactory results, the veto vessel, PMTs, and associated DAQ electronics were all shipped to Italy for tests in the underground Hall B of LNGS. \nAt LNGS in Italy, preparations of space for the installation of SABRE in the underground Hall C of LNGS, near the Borexino scintillator handling equipment, have been underway for several months in 2016 and were completed in early May 2017.   \nNew background simulations have been completed based on detailed designs of the external shielding, the liquid scintillator vessel, and the NaI(Tl) crystal with its PMTs, and the crystal-PMT enclosure.  The calculations confirm earlier simulations, and predict an overall background about 10 times lower than DAMA-LIBRA, mostly dominated by 87Rb (upper limit), and 40K radioactive impurities in the crystal. \nThe LNGS group designed and ordered the shielding for the SABRE liquid scintillator vessel. The external shielding will consist of polyethylene plates, and moveable water tanks. The LNGS group is also active in planning the liquid scintillator operations and assigned to an outside firm the preparation of a full safety analysis, whose completion is expected shortly. \nLNGS engineers designed a low background radio-pure enclosure for the crystal-PMT system and ordered and a mock-up for testing crystal handling.   A system for inserting and removing the crystals into the liquid scintillator without draining the scintillator has been designed by the Rome group. \nThe schedule of SABRE is uncertain and could be impacted by on-going safety inspections of the laboratory by outside agencies.  Assuming no delays due the inspections, nor from technical difficulties, taking data could start in summer of 2017.\n\n\nSABRE South.\n\nAlthough not part of this award, we note that plans for a SABRE twin detector in Australia are progressing well. \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/22/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frank P Calaprice"
