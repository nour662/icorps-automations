 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary \r\nDoctoral Dissertation Research: Schools, Families and Children's Food Allergies\r\nPeter Conrad\r\nVanessa Lopes Mu\u00f1oz\r\nBrandeis University\r\n\r\nAbout 4% of children reported a food allergy in 2007-an increase of nearly 18%\r\nduring the course of a decade. Preventing and responding to severe allergic reactions can\r\nrequire the involvement of many actors in schools, restaurants, and childcare centers. By\r\nexamining how multiple actors adhere to food allergy policies and guidelines, this study\r\nseeks to fill an existing gap in sociological studies of health and illness.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. A longstanding concern in sociology and in medicine is explaining\r\nunder what conditions, and to what ends, people adhere to medical regimens. Conrad and\r\nothers have argued that ill persons make decisions about following medical regimens\r\nlargely based on their everyday lives, making the case that daily social interactions are at\r\nleast as important as doctor-patient relationships. Conditions that are managed primarily\r\nthrough lifestyle changes,such as changes in diet,raise questions about the role of\r\nmultiple actors in managing health conditions. To address these questions, this study\r\nexamines how families and schools adhere to food allergy policies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact. This study would expand knowledge about the management of health\r\nconditions that are rising in prevalence-food allergies. Results from this study may\r\ninform health policies related to an array of conditions that require intensive lifestyle\r\nchanges, such as asthma, diabetes, and food intolerances. Findings may also be of interest\r\nto healthcare professionals, families, and school administrators. This research will be\r\nused for a doctoral dissertation and in undergraduate teaching.",
