 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to support a planning visit and subsequent preliminary field work to establish a joint research effort between an interdisciplinary team from East Carolina University (ECU) and the Institute of Oceanography at the Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT), which is on the east coast of peninsular Malaysia.  The planned program of research and associated educational activities are aimed at understanding post-glacial variations of the East Asian Monsoon through chemical analyses of sub-seafloor strata in the basins of the Sunda Shelf. UMT owns a new research vessel that will be used in the field work. The data collected will be the basis for more complete research proposal to NSF.  Little information is currently available concerning the paleoclimate of the Sunda Shelf and SE Asia.  The collaboration with UMT and access to its research ship provide an opportunity to broaden the geological database and to compare the results in this region with existing knowledge from the deeper South China Sea to the north.\r\n\r\n The East Asian Monsoon and changing sea levels have a major impact on the populations of SE Asia, particularly through flooding and coastal erosion. A better understanding of past variations in these factors can help populations prepare for future challenges. The planned collaboration will engage both young faculty members from ECU as well as undergraduate and graduate students. Finally, this is an excellent opportunity to promote broader engagement of the US scientific community with Malaysian counterparts, which has been relatively rare.",
