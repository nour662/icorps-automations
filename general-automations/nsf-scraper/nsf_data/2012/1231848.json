This methodology can be well applicable to other wireless network settings\r\nsuch as cooperative relay networks, cellular networks, and wireless sensor and mesh\r\nnetworks; 3) The research will be timely integrated to collaborations with industrial\r\npartners and education of undergraduate and graduate students, particularly, underrepresented\r\nminority students, thus enhancing the impact to the society via technology innovation.",
