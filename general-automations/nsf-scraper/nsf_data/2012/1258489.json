The workshop will bring together leading contributors to the theoretical literature on social networks with anthropologists and other field researchers using network techniques to study the social structure of small-scale societies. The objectives are: (a) to enrich network theory by deploying it in a large set of data in an attempt to answer central social science questions of political hierarchy and economic inequality; (b) to enhance the theoretical, statistical and computational capacity of field workers in the quantitative study of networks; and (c) to provide the basis of one or more synthetic comparative papers, as well as papers on the individual populations involved.",
