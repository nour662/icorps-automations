 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Multi-Service Exchange (MSX) platform facilitates an environment where the advanced network functions are extended throughout campus over a Software Defined Networking (SDN) solution, e.g., OpenFlow, de facto creating a dynamic Science DMZ driven entirely by science application workflows. Its architecture decouples the campus network operational mission from science data flows dynamically. MSX makes the protocols and interfaces of the wide-area networks, such as Internet2's ION, DYNES, perfSONAR, and others interoperable with the campus SDN solutions such as OpenFlow.  The MSX platform also provides an option for data landing solutions, facilitated by a wide array of campus-facing NAS and SAN storage interfaces. The platform is also made physically accessible to campus researches for manually initiated, scheduled data transport.\r\n\r\nHowever, the main focus of this effort is to integrate the advanced network functions with individual science applications, algorithms and workflows. By concentrating predominantly on science applications code, the MSX software development team helps domain scientists extricate themselves from the need to maintain either a deep network-related knowledge or specialized staff. The integration of the selected science applications with advanced network technologies lets them treat any network function as a resource - an integral part of their algorithms and workflows.\r\n\r\nBy architecting the Multi Service Exchange in the most flexible, adaptable way, MSX will establish a platform applicable to any campus, providing them with a point from which to develop new (or terminate existing) services and make them available to on-campus and off-campus researchers.",
