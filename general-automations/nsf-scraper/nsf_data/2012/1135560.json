LISN is a distributed observatory composed of GPS receivers, flux gate magnetometers, and Vertical Incidence Pulsed Ionospheric Radar (VIPIR) ionosondes installed principally in the western half of South America. The work carried out under this grant will collect, store, and disseminate real-time ionospheric observables - a nowcast - and to conduct dedicated campaigns and investigations leading toward developing a predictive capability - a forecast - of the electrodynamics and stability of the low- latitude ionosphere over South America.",

The LISN ionosondes are part of the entire LISN distributed observatory.  These ionosondes are radar systems that transmit radio energy in the range of 1 to 25 MHz upward into the overhead ionosphere, where the radio signals resonate with the Earth&rsquo;s ionosphere and magnetic field and the radio energy is reflected back to the ground.  In the reflection process, the ionosphere induces changes to the radio signal which allow measurement of plasma density versus height as well as motion in the plasma.   Effort was focused on instruments in southern Bolivia and northern Argentina.  In this location, the dynamics of the ionosphere cause greatly increased plasma densities, enhancing the effects of the ionosphere on radio wave propagation for communication and navigation.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%;\">The ionosondes are physically large, with multiple 35m tall towers and requiring a land area of at least 100x100m.  As sensitive and sophisticated research instruments that operate in a radio frequency environment that is crowded with other users and increasingly crowded by man-made electrical noise, the instruments are difficult to install, calibrate, operate and maintain, especially in these remote areas of the world.  The majority effort under this award was spent on improving the quality of the data obtained through field site visits.  The signal cables 150m in length leading to multiple spaced antennas must be calibrated to a few centimeters in length and kept calibrated through changes in temperature, rainfall and over long periods of time.  Sources of radio frequency interference appear and must be mitigated.  The instrument is susceptible to damage from nearby lightning strikes.
