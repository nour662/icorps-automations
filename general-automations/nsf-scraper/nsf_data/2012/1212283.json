The aim of the partnership is to increase the presence of physics, broadly defined, at the SACNAS National Conference.   This annual conference is an opportunity for a talented group of predominantly Hispanic and Native-American students to interact with students and professionals in their disciplines, to present their research results, to learn about cutting-edge research, and to attend a variety of professional development sessions.   This award will support the travel of a total of approximately forty students over three years to the conference.   The award will also support the attendance of four professionals per year; these will be NSHP members who participate in the NSHP sessions and judge the physics and physics-related presentations.   The award is supported by the Division of Physics, the Division of Materials Research, and the Division of Astronomical Sciences.",
