This conference will showcase basic-research contributions of the 28 states, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands; while also highlighting opportunities for EPSCoR jurisdictions to become a vehicle for the public?s benefit through job creation, entrepreneurship, external engagement, and innovation. \r\n\r\nThe conference seeks to identify opportunities and barriers for EPSCoR programs to support basic research and development, education, innovation, and entrepreneurship to deliver on national priorities. The themes coalesce around research into a collective approach for creating and sustaining an informed and knowledgeable populace capable of identifying and characterizing societal problems (Know), developing the infrastructure of resources and collaboration necessary to solve these problems (Create), and providing a framework for the effective translation of these solutions into deployment (Implement). The conference will explore how extensive EPSCoR knowledge and research infrastructure can be better leveraged to accelerate knowledge discovery, and how research infrastructure and its data streams can better contribute to the national research community. A series of workshops are planned to create action plans for community college workforce development and entrepreneurship as well as implementation of research-based innovation in commercial and related application.",
