The scientific\r\nprogram consists of invited lectures, contributed talks, and poster presentations. The workshop\r\nis held in a single-session format and is intended to be an international forum for discussions on\r\nthe current trends and future directions of computational electronics. The 15th International\r\nWorkshop on Computational Electronics (IWCE 2012) will be held between May 22 and May\r\n25, 2012 at the University of Wisconsin ? Madison. In recent years, the IWCE community has\r\nbeen increasingly active in the field of energy harvesting, especially thermoelectrics. Therefore,\r\nat IWCE 2012 there will be a companion two-day \"School on Phonon Dynamics, Heat Transfer,\r\nand Thermoelectric Phenomena in Nanostructures\" held May 21-22, 2012 before the workshop.\r\nFunding is requested to support student participation at the IWCE conference and the\r\nPhonon School. The grant will be used to issue student travel awards that will cover lodging\r\nand registration fees up to $750 per student. Awards for 20 students will be provided by this\r\ngrant. Following the program committee's review of all submitted abstracts, authors of the top\r\nranked student abstracts will be selected as the travel award recipients. In the case of multiple\r\nsimilarly ranked abstracts, priority for the travel award will be given to an underrepresented\r\nminority student or a female student.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit. IWCE 2012 will draw particular attention to the frontiers of computational\r\nelectronics that connect to materials science, physics, and energy applications. Three focus\r\nsessions, with only invited talks, and the Phonon School will offer an infusion of potential new\r\nresearch directions for the whole community. There is a lot of challenging computational work to\r\nbe done in spintronics, thermal transport in nanostructures, and materials for energy\r\napplications. This workshop will serve as a starting point for many exciting avenues and an\r\nevolution of the topics addressed by the computational electronics community. In addition, with\r\na strong focus on thermal and thermoelectric phenomena, IWCE is poised to make a bridge\r\nbetween the heat transfer and electronics communities, which will strengthen both in the quest\r\nfor nanomaterials solutions to energy problems.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts. By enabling students to take part in the conference, we will be help the new\r\ngenerations of researchers to come onto the stage early in their career and be recognized for\r\ntheir work among peers and senior researchers. This grant will enable 20 students to attend the\r\nconference, thereby increasing student participation, improving their exposure in the\r\nprofessional community, and benefiting their careers in the long term. We will ensure\r\nparticipation of women and underrepresented minority scientists as invited speakers at the\r\nevent. Prominence of these role models will have a beneficial effect on the female and minority\r\nstudents whose participation at the IWCE will be supported by this grant.",
