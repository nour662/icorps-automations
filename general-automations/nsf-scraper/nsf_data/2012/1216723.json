 "awd_abstract_narration": "As science today grows increasingly digital, it poses exciting challenges and opportunities for researchers. Whether it is streaming data from sensors, simulating the formation of tornadoes, annotating and sharing tagged audio and video data, or using geographic information systems to anticipate the spread of disease, the frontiers of transformative science are enormous and continue to grow. Many scientists are turning to web portals or science gateways to allow them to analyze, share, and understand large volumes of data more effectively. The existence of science gateways - and the sophisticated cyberinfrastructure (CI) tools and resources behind these accessible web interfaces - can significantly improve the productivity of researchers facing the most difficult challenges. Most important, science gateways can democratize access to the cyberinfrastructure that enables cutting edge science. Now the best minds can tackle today\u00b9s most challenging science problems, regardless of their affiliation.\r\n\r\nScience gateway developers face several challenges. They often work in isolation even though development can be quite similar across domain areas, they bridge local, campus, national and sometimes international cyberinfrastructure, they need foundational building blocks so they can focus on higher-level grand-challenge functionality. Sustainable funding for science gateways can also be difficult to secure as they span the worlds of research and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis one-year planning award will gather community feedback, forming the foundation of a Science Gateway Institute. The institute will be an incubator of sorts for science gateways, vastly increasing their chances for long term success. It will provide a forum for developers to share ideas, approaches and software. It will provide expertise - in science gateway building, in technologies enabling grand challenge research, in open community software development, in virtual organizations, in project management and in science gateway sustainability. It will provide workforce development, training the next generation for careers in this dynamic, cross-disciplinary and important area.",

Sustainable funding for science gateways can also be difficult to secure because they span the worlds of research and infrastructure.\n\n\n \nThis project funded the conceptualization and design of a Science Gateways Institute to serve the needs of the nation\u00c6s researchers. Millions of dollars are spent on developing science gateways (also known as web portals). The Science Gateways Institute will seek to transform the way gateways are built by providing a community of practice, common standards, and a range of support services to boost developer productivity and maximize the public investment in science gateways.\n\n\n \nDuring this conceptualization phase, the team solicited community input through a wide variety of forums: workshops at major conferences, focus group meetings, interviews with numerous stakeholders, and a survey of 29,000 NSF grant recipients. Most of the funding was expended on participant support to bring stakeholders to meetings to gather inputs. From these many sources of community-member ideas and insights, the team developed a strategic plan for the institute that was delivered to NSF.  The strategic plan is the synthesis of thousands of perspectives on community and developer needs. When fully funded, the Science Gateways Institute will support gateway developers through a number of services identified as critical needs, including incubation services (e.g., business plan and marketing expertise, software and licensing recommendations, usability), an extended support team for hands-on assistance, multiple venues for the community to share experiences through workshops and online events, a gateway framework that allows modular contributions, and workforce development resources such as student financial support and curricula. \n\n\n \n\nScience gateways can substantially enhance productivity across all fields of science and engineering and allow an even greater impact of the large-scale public investments in supercomputing, software, networks, and instruments. This project made important progress in the design and planning for the Science Gateways Institute, which will speed the development and deployment of these gateways to discovery.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/21/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katherine Lawrence"
