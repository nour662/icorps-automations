The instrument, a turnkey customizable 3D virtual reality system with applications in complementary research and training experience in the broad areas of rehabilitation engineering and science, also  includes a cylindrical screen projection system, 12-camera real-time motion-capture system, a six degree-of-freedom motion base and a control software suite. The team includes about 20 PIs from various departments at the institution, which currently lacks a shared virtual reality simulation facility for large collaborative projects. The instrumentation, to be used for fundamental research in various disciplines, analysis and creation of innovative technology solutions that can be rapidly evaluated, tested, prototyped and commercialized, is expected to dramatically reduce the need for costly physical simulations and allow complex testing not otherwise possible. The following research projects will be supported by CAREN:\r\n-\tFundamental research: measure effects of sensory inputs (e.g., visual, auditory, vestibular, tactile);\r\n-\tEarly diagnosis related research: quantify behavioral indicators for early detection of disorders;\r\n-\tApplied rehabilitation research: provide real-time feedback to the user, thus allowing rapid correction of therapeutic movements;\r\n-\tSports medicine research: optimize training techniques for peak performance and injury prevention; and\r\n-\tResearch on rehabilitation transfer to daily life: model environments that allow more real-life training for enhancing laboratory or clinic based rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe impact should be felt both regionally and nationally. At the national level, the proposed system could have great implications for improving the quality of life of individuals with disabilities and older adults. At the local level, the VR equipment will be integrated into a number of courses and will engage K-12 students. It is expected that the engagement of students through the REU program can greatly impact undergraduate research. There is a substantial industrial partnership and potential for technology transfer.",
