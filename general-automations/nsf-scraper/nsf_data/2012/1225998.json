The goal is to bring the scientists from across the disciplines of geosciences and computer science to consider the task of initiating a geomaterials genome project along the lines suggested for the materials genome project.  The conference will permit the attendees to plan a community-driven development of an integrated database with contributions from geologists, geochemists, geophysicists, and thermochemists. They will interact with computer scientists who will devise methods for implementation of databases for different applications and thus promote geoscientific research and education.",
