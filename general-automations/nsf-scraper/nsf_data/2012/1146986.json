 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predation is a powerful factor driving the evolution of prey behavior. One gap in our understanding of predator-prey relationships is how prey detect predators and whether predator detection is enhanced by different sensory adaptations depending on habitat type. Tackling this question is challenging because vertebrate prey usually have sensory systems that differ from that of humans, making it necessary to study the sensory physiology of the study organisms to understand how they perceive their environment. The goal of this project is to establish how the configuration of the visual system shapes anti-predator behavior in bird species living in different habitats. Birds are excellent study species because they have complex visual systems that vary extensively between species and occupy diverse habitats. In open habitats (e.g. grasslands), it is critical for prey to quickly detect predators approaching from afar; hence, prey are expected to have sensory adaptations that enhance visual acuity, which influences the distance at which they can detect approaching predators. In closed habitats (e.g. forests), predators may approach from many directions since the habitat is complex; hence, prey are expected to have sensory adaptations that enhance visual coverage around their heads. This study will address from a visual physiology and behavioral ecology perspectives the question of what makes prey effective at avoiding predation in different environments, and thus will provide a novel framework for understanding the diversity of anti-predator strategies. Novel eye-tracking technology will be developed to record targets of visual attention in small birds, which can be used in the future to study visual attention and lateralization in other vertebrates with laterally placed eyes. Additionally, the PI will disseminate the results of this project to the general public through media publications, seminars, and a public outreach program developed for K-12 schools on how birds see their world.",

(i.e., species that detect food at close distances) and avian ?predators? (i.e., species that detect food at far distances). Overall, avian predatory species appear to maximize the detection of prey via frontal spatial vision tuned to enhancing visual acuity through the equidistant placement of their four centers of acute vision around the fronto-lateral portion of the visual field and a reduction in binocular vision (Figure 1). On the contrary, avian prey species appear to maximize the detection of predators via relatively wide visual fields (i.e., narrow blind area) with only two centers of acute vision projecting more laterally (Figure 1). However, prey species appear to have flexibility in their visual configuration maximizing either lateral vision or frontal vision as a result of their relatively large degree of eye movements. The frontal vision of prey species is likely tuned to enhancing achromatic visual discrimination for food finding purposes. We also found some novel visual sensory specializations within these patterns. For instance, flycatchers, which are sit-and-wait predatory birds, have within some of their cones a high- energy-producing cellular structure called MMOD-complex, which consists of a megamitochondria surrounded by hundreds of small, orange-colored lipid droplets (Figure 2). This structure could allow birds to see flying insects in slow motion and/or better discriminate these insects against the blue sky or green vegetation. We also found an association between visual system configuration and behavior across different bird species. Bird species with a greater degree of variation in visual spatial resolution within their retina tended to show a higher degree of eye and head movements than species with a lower within-retinal spatial variation in acuity. One explanation is that species with lower peripheral visual resolution would rely more on the center of acute vision to gather high quality information and consequently would need to move the center of acute vision more often.
