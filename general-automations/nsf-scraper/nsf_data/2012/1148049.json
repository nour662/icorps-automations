 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infants' early experience with faces shapes how they perceive and process faces. On average, infants show greater expertise (e.g., better facial recognition) when processing familiar face types (e.g., females and same-race faces) compared to less familiar face types (e.g., males and other-race faces). Given that such expertise impacts every face-to-face social interaction throughout development, it is critical to understand why some infants show this expertise, whereas others do not. Moreover, it is important to determine if the neutral expressions of the faces typically used to test this expertise produce results different from those found with smiling faces, an expression most infants more commonly experience and prefer. Such expertise is evident via how infants scan faces, what faces they prefer to look at, and how well they recognize faces, but no one has assessed if and how these abilities are related. This expertise becomes particularly evident between 6 and 9 months of age, but it is unclear why or how it emerges. There is also a need to better understand how this early expertise manifests later in development. To address these issues, this research will examine how 6-10-month-olds' recent facial experience, emotional state, temperament, and motor skills affect their scanning, visual preferences for, and recognition of female/male faces or familiar/unfamiliar race faces with smiling or neutral expressions. It will also assess the relationships between perception (scanning) and processing (preferences/recognition) abilities. The investigator will also examine how this expertise emerges, and presumably stabilizes, in a small sample of infants that will participate every two weeks between 6 to 10 months of age. Participants will be retested at 3.5 years of age to examine how infant face processing abilities and individual characteristics predict preschoolers' face processing.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this research is that it should provide a more comprehensive understanding of why and how face processing expertise develops. It should also demonstrate how individual differences in face processing expertise and other characteristics (e.g., temperament) contribute to the development of concepts about familiar and unfamiliar social groups. For example, infants' emotional responses to a certain sex or race may represent the first concepts associated with that social group. Such concepts can be positive or negative and have noteworthy consequences for how perceivers judge and treat a target person and how that target behaves, impacting the target's relationships, health, and academic and occupational success. Gaining knowledge of individual differences in the origins of how individuals perceive, process, and acquire concepts about members of various social groups is critical to understanding the social factors that affect people's well being.",

This project examined whether and how individual differences in social experience, facial scanning, temperament, physiology, and motor development predicted expertise or deficits in these face processing abilities. Some data were collected in Sweden and some were collected in the United States. Data collection is still ongoing in the U.S., but preliminary results show important individual differences in infants&rsquo; perceptual expertise.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Social experience.</em> Due to Sweden&rsquo;s parental leave policy, many Swedish infants have alternating experience with a female and male primary caregiver (distributed caregiving). We found that 10-, 14-, and 16-month-olds with distributed caregiving experience were more successful at locating (recognizing) a familiarized male face among three other distracter male faces than were infants with a female primary caregiver only. Infants with a female primary caregiver only and those with distributed caregiving experience were equally successful at recognizing familiarized female faces (Figure 1). The intellectual merit of this research is that caregiver experience affected face discrimination abilities and the improved male face recognition that infants with distributed caregiving displayed did not hinder their female face recognition. In contrast, infants with female primary caregiver experience only become quite specialized in processing female faces and showed a relation between their visual preferences and face recognition abilities. For example, the more attention infants with a female primary caregiver only directed toward female faces during the visual preference task, the less male faces they recognized and the more quickly they recognized female faces. A broader impact of this research is that a parental leave policy designed to better equate caregiving and working between the two genders can also impact infants&rsquo; face discrimination.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Temperament and physiology. </em>Preliminary data show that U.S. 6- to 10-month-olds high in surgency/extraversion have more difficulty recognizing familiar race females compared with those lower in surgency. Preschoolers high in surgency show reduced working memory and difficulty regulating their attention (Wolfe &amp; Bell, 2007), so that might explain high surgency infants&rsquo; reduced performance in remembering familiar face types. Moreover, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), which is a measure of breathing in relation to heartbeat and a marker of infants&rsquo; sensitivity to their environment, predicts 6- to 10-month-olds&rsquo; perceptual expertise. Compared with high RSA babies, low RSA babies are less likely to show visual preferences for familiar race females and show poorer recognition of female faces (Figure 2a), perhaps due to difficulty focusing their attention toward relevant stimuli. Last, starting around 7 months of age, infants show greater sustained attention (a decelerated heart rate, which indicates more effortful processing) when viewing familiar race relative to unfamiliar race female-male face pairs (Figure 2b). This less effortful processing of unfamiliar race faces might contribute to declines in their discrimination of unfamiliar race faces. The intellectual merit of these findings is that some infants are at risk for not developing perceptual expertise due to temperament or physiology. More broadly, interventions focused on regulating attention might be necessary to avoid such deficits impeding social skills.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Motor development.</em> Preliminary data show that U.S. 6- to 10-month-olds&rsquo; motor development (not crawling, transitioning to crawling, independently crawling) is a better predictor of infants&rsquo; visual preference for familiar race females than infant age. The predictive motor ability, however, varies based on whether infants see female-male face pairs that pose neutral or pleasant expressions. When infants are not yet crawling, they show visual preferences for familiar race females with neutral expressions. As infants transition to crawling, they show visual preferences for females with pleasant expressions (Figure 3). The intellectual merit of this finding is that infants adapt their preferences to meet the demands of their environment. Non-mobile infants might attend more to neutral expression female than male faces to learn more about the female category (with whom they mostly interact) and/or due to an aversion to neutral expression males (who might be perceived as angry; Zebrowitz et al., 2010). Infants in transition to crawling might attend more to positive expression female than male faces because they are typically dependent on their female caregiver&rsquo;s expressions as they begin learning whether or not they should approach someone or something (Hirshberg &amp; Svejda, 1990). A broader impact of this finding is that it demonstrates how infant perception and action are intertwined.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although infants&rsquo; development of perceptual expertise likely enables them to successfully navigate social interactions with frequently experienced individuals (familiar race females), it might also become linked to positive implicit biases for females and familiar race individuals. We will begin testing this possible broader impact in December 2016 when the first infant participant returns as a preschooler.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/25/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jennifer&nbsp;L&nbsp;Rennels</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1148049/1148049_10180180_1472148846613_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1148049/1148049_10180180_1472148846613_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1148049/1148049_10180180_1472148846613_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The % of faces infants located based on caregiving experience and sex of face.
