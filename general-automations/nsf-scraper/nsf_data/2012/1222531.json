 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will document the pattern of river bank and floodplain erosion and deposition associated with Hurricane Irene flooding across an array of watersheds in central New England.  The response of watersheds to extreme floods is a long-standing research focus in fluvial geomorphology, hydraulic engineering, and flood risk management.  Previous studies demonstrated that rainfall, peak discharge, and sediment transport rates alone cannot fully explain the ability of a flood to shape the landscape.  Initial attempts to more fully generalize the factors that enhance the geomorphic effectiveness of floods were hindered, in part, by a focus on flooding impacts within a single river basin.  Some success in developing a generalized comparative cause-effect analysis of the geomorphic impact of extreme flooding has been achieved through the use of unit stream power.  The investigators will explore the concept that in addition to a threshold value in unit stream power, the response of a channel to extreme floods with respect to major morphological changes (e.g. channel reconfiguration or widening) and fine-grained sediment transport and deposition is sensitive to the geomorphic context of individual reaches.  In conjunction with previously collected baseline data, they will collect data that will provide a rare opportunity to test this novel framework for predicting reach and regional-scale geomorphic controls on channel response and recovery to large floods.  The investigators will derive and map watershed scale relationships of well-established metrics linked to fluvial processes, such as stream power, from the rapidly expanding resources of readily available geospatial data (e.g., aerial imagery, high-resolution topography).  To gain insight into how channel morphological changes impact fine sediment dynamics, they will use the short-lived fallout radionuclides 7Be and 210Pb to determine the longitudinal variations in fine sediment aggradation.  They will focus on fine sediment dynamics because of its well-established controls on riparian ecological processes and its control on the transport and fate of particle-bound contaminants.\r\n\r\nProject results will help develop process-based metrics for evaluating the response and recovery of watersheds from a profound disturbance in terms of both channel morphology and fine sediment sedimentation.  The project has potential for transformative impact through its development of a simple but robust field-tested methodology that will enable land managers to use readily-available GIS datasets to predict and plan for future stream channel changes.  These outcomes will help guide state and federal agencies in future flood mitigation efforts and provide a template for natural processes of river restoration.  Undergraduate and graduate students involved in this project will benefit from participation in professional development opportunities, such as Dartmouth College's GK-12 program and its Center for the Advancement of Learning, and through educational outreach programs, such as Junior Science Cafes in regional secondary schools.",

Intellectual merits of the project include the development of a method to assess fluvial geomorphic equilibrium that we used to document the rate of channel recovery from Irene.  We showed that the short duration, high energy flows of Irene transported large amounts of sediments of all sizes, but caused spatially limited erosive, channel widening.  While channel erosion contributed to much of the short term impacts of Irene, longer term impacts and recovery of river channels were strongly controlled by the input of fine sediment from channel-adjacent landslides initiated by Irene. We showed that the locations of these landslides were well predicted by the locations of downstream increases in stream power and that Irene reduced the complexity of stream channel by decreasing downstream variations stream power. Analysis of five years of topographic and sediment size measurements from 15 sites on gravel-bedded streams in New England showed that many reaches were out of equilibrium post-Irene, but not in a consistent manner; some reaches narrowed and coarsened, others widened and fined.  The watershed did eventually experience a common direction of geomorphic change.  Landslides activated during the storm provided a persistent source of sediment post-Irene, leading to fining of channel bed sediment throughout the study region two years after the storm.  While channels had, on average, re-attained equilibrium by five years post-Irene, the channel remained finer than pre-Irene and suspended sediment fluxes remained an order of magnitude higher than pre-Irene fluxes across a wide range of discharges.  Together these analyses resulted in the development of a rapid method for regionally assessing the locations prone to erosion during extreme floods.  Almost all of the widening (&gt; 98 percent) during Irene occurred along reaches identified as susceptible to widening using our methodology.  The broader impacts of the project include the establishment of metrics for predicting the locations of geomorphic impact that will help to establish a better toolkit for watershed managers to ascertain critical areas along river corridors to protect or manage.  More generally, results demonstrate that land-use management will be more effective if it addresses changes in geomorphic process that extreme floods trigger.
