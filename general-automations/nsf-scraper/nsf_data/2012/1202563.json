 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Midwest Center of Excellence (LSMCE) will serve as a resource and support entity to broaden the participation of underrepresented minority (URM) students at 28 non-LSAMP institutions in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin and who have chosen academic majors in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) degree programs. The Center?s activities will be concentrated in areas of information dissemination and outreach. Its goal is to strengthen the recruitment and retention of URM students through mentoring and providing support to ease the transitional challenges at critical educational junctures.\r\n\r\n LSMCE has three primary objectives: \r\nObjective 1: Taking a leadership role to articulate the national critical need for broadening minority participation and success in STEM undergraduate programs. Objective 2: Developing an information hub that provides consistent on-line resources and sustained opportunities to showcase best practices in STEM teaching/learning and to support URM students? persistence and engagement through research and internship experiences. Objective 3: Establishing a cyber portal, cLSMCE hub, to disseminate information and create networks of support for non-LSAMP students on the 28 partner campuses in the Midwest.\r\n\r\n LSMCE activities will broaden the participation of historically underrepresented groups, including women and ethnic and racial minorities in the STEM enterprise, by providing access to research and science programs and by working diligently with non-LSAMP institutions. The Center will not only help to close the gap created by the paucity of underserved individuals who are STEM professionals functioning creatively, it also encourages others who have been reticent to attempt baccalaureate-level science work.",

The&nbsp;LSMCE, as a Pilot Regional Center of Excellence&nbsp;communicated best practices, tools, and broadening participation research data garnered from NSF&nbsp;awardees&nbsp;of the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) to the broader audience. Additionally, the Center provided assistance to 28 Midwestern non-LSAMP&nbsp;institutions of higher&nbsp;education&nbsp;with relevant knowledge for the development of strategies that may result in positive impacts on&nbsp;URM students' performance, persistence and success in STEM degree programs. The&nbsp;LSMCE&nbsp;also offered opportunities for STEM faculty and students from partner institutions to participate in professional development activities such as&nbsp;online&nbsp;or on-site workshops, annual conferences, and&nbsp;webinars. The Center served as a platform for intellectual exchanges among broadening participation practitioners and helped in networking among STEM&nbsp;URM&nbsp;students' communities. The primary activities of the Center were; (i) partnership building with colleges and universities in the Midwest, (ii) providing support to 28 non-LSAMP&nbsp;partner institutions to encourage deeper engagement in helping&nbsp;URM&nbsp;students succeed in STEM disciplines, and (iii) disseminating broadening participation information to the&nbsp;LSAMP&nbsp;community and the broader public.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merits:</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;LSMCE&nbsp;served as a resource and supported entities funded by NSF to broaden the participation of&nbsp;URM&nbsp;students&nbsp;who matriculated in STEM majors at the 28 Midwestern non-LSAMP&nbsp;institutions. The Center provided consistent&nbsp;online&nbsp;resources via an interactive website and opportunities that highlighted best practices in student&nbsp;recruitment, retention, graduation and matriculation into STEM graduate&nbsp;programs. Of the 28 partner institutions, 17 schools acknowledged the Center's impacts through their recent development of new student support programs, increasing awareness about diversity and inclusion, obtaining external grant support and building additional collaborations that grew out of&nbsp;LSMCE involvement. Additionally,&nbsp;LSMCE&nbsp;hosted more than 30 virtual learning sessions for faculty mentors and students. The Center is a depository of professional development videos,&nbsp;webinars&nbsp;and workshop for faculty and students. For faculty, the topics ranged from student academic transitions, mentoring, to best practices in program evaluation. Students' series focused on developing soft and hard skills that are needed to thrive in the academic and industry environments. The Center also hosted five annual conferences for students and faculty offering them with the opportunities to showcase their work in supporting&nbsp;URM&nbsp;success and career advancement in STEM. The&nbsp;LSMCE&nbsp;annual conferences continued to grow in attendance, engagement, and broadening participation impacts. The five-year event welcomed a total of 1,441 participants from 134 different institutions and 42&nbsp;LSAMP&nbsp;alliances. In addition, the event produced 14 keynote presenters, 105 breakout sessions and workshops for faculty and administrators, as well as, 408 students who presented their scholarly work at the poster sessions. Evaluation findings of the 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;annual conference indicated that the majority of non-student conference attendees (94%) and student conference attendees (87%) rated the overall conference as either good or excellent, with networking named as the highest valued activity by both non-student and student attendees. These results were consistent with the conference evaluation finding from 2014-16, which further validated the impact and value of the conference experiences. The conference activities resulted in the development of robust collaborations between&nbsp;LSMCE&nbsp;and the&nbsp;LSAMP&nbsp;Alliances as evident by the high level of engagement and participation of the alliance members who served as conference presenters, panelists and discussion leaders.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The&nbsp;LSMCE&nbsp;website functions as a communication hub,&nbsp;connecting&nbsp;people, from around the world, who care about diversity and inclusion work being done at hundreds of colleges and universities across the United States with a focus on the persistent efforts to broaden the participation of&nbsp;URM&nbsp;students in STEM disciplines and careers. Students and faculty report that&nbsp;LSMCE&nbsp;conferences and&nbsp;online&nbsp;resources open up opportunities that would not otherwise be available to&nbsp;URM&nbsp;students, especially those at the&nbsp;LSMCE&nbsp;partner institutions. The implementation&nbsp;of&nbsp;LSAMP&nbsp;model and cross-institutional collaborations developed as results of the&nbsp;LSMCE&nbsp;network&nbsp;showed&nbsp;great potential of growth and positively impacted the academic preparation,&nbsp;professionalization, retention and graduation of&nbsp;URM&nbsp;students in STEM. The&nbsp;LSMCE&nbsp;website and biweekly&nbsp;eNewsletters&nbsp;shared information about funding opportunities for paid internships and graduate schools further increased the participation rate of&nbsp;URM&nbsp;students in STEM graduate programs and the nation's skilled workforce.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/28/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;Botanga</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1202563/1202563_10198431_1586358987897_LSMCEWebsite(002)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1202563/1202563_10198431_1586358987897_LSMCEWebsite(002)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"LSMCE Website\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1202563/1202563_10198431_1586358987897_LSMCEWebsite(002)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"LSMCE Website\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">LSMCE Main Page on the Web 2013-2019</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CSU/IUPUI</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Botanga</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LSMCE Website</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1202563/1202563_10198431_1586359488974_lsmce-logo(002)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1202563/1202563_10198431_1586359488974_lsmce-logo(002)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"LSMCE Logo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1202563/1202563_10198431_1586359488974_lsmce-logo(002)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"LSMCE Logo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The logo representing the Louis Stokes Midwest Center of Excellence 2013-19</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CSU/IUPUI</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Botanga</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LSMCE Logo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1202563/1202563_10198431_1586360714181_NSFPIPDmeeting2017Indianapolis--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1202563/1202563_10198431_1586360714181_NSFPIPDmeeting2017Indianapolis--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"LSMCE Hosted LSAMP PIs Meeting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1202563/1202563_10198431_1586360714181_NSFPIPDmeeting2017Indianapolis--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"LSMCE Hosted LSAMP PIs Meeting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Principal Investigators and Project Directors of the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Gathered at the LSMCE Conference on October 6, 2017.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CSU/IUPUI</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Botanga</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LSMCE Hosted LSAMP PIs Meeting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1202563/1202563_10198431_1586361676539_EatonPosterSession2018MI--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1202563/1202563_10198431_1586361676539_EatonPosterSession2018MI--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Poster Session at Eaton Corp.

In addition, the event produced 14 keynote presenters, 105 breakout sessions and workshops for faculty and administrators, as well as, 408 students who presented their scholarly work at the poster sessions. Evaluation findings of the 5th annual conference indicated that the majority of non-student conference attendees (94%) and student conference attendees (87%) rated the overall conference as either good or excellent, with networking named as the highest valued activity by both non-student and student attendees. These results were consistent with the conference evaluation finding from 2014-16, which further validated the impact and value of the conference experiences. The conference activities resulted in the development of robust collaborations between LSMCE and the LSAMP Alliances as evident by the high level of engagement and participation of the alliance members who served as conference presenters, panelists and discussion leaders.\n\nBroader Impacts: The LSMCE website functions as a communication hub, connecting people, from around the world, who care about diversity and inclusion work being done at hundreds of colleges and universities across the United States with a focus on the persistent efforts to broaden the participation of URM students in STEM disciplines and careers. Students and faculty report that LSMCE conferences and online resources open up opportunities that would not otherwise be available to URM students, especially those at the LSMCE partner institutions. The implementation of LSAMP model and cross-institutional collaborations developed as results of the LSMCE network showed great potential of growth and positively impacted the academic preparation, professionalization, retention and graduation of URM students in STEM. The LSMCE website and biweekly eNewsletters shared information about funding opportunities for paid internships and graduate schools further increased the participation rate of URM students in STEM graduate programs and the nation's skilled workforce. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher Botanga"
