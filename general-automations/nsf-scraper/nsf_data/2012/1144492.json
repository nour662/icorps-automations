 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arachnids comprise one of the most diverse groups of animals, with numerous representatives in all terrestrial ecosystems. Aside from Acari (mites and ticks), whose total estimated diversity might reach up to one million species, the orders Araneae (spiders) and Opiliones (harvestmen or daddy longlegs) are the most diverse arachnid lineages. The main goal of this project is to carry out taxonomic revisions (monographs) of several lineages across selected Neotropical groups in two arachnid orders (Araneae [spiders] and Opiliones [daddy long legs]). The groups that we have targeted in this proposal are mainly leaf litter inhabitants (except for mimetids), grossly undersampled and understudied, that lack modern revisionary work and include many undescribed taxa at the species level and above, and thus provide excellent research and training opportunities in modern monography and systematics.  The largely overlapping Neotropical distribution of our study groups allows us to effectively collect these arachnids in joint field expeditions. Some of these study taxa also pose similar biogeographic and evolutionary questions that can be addressed with common methodology and expertise. \r\n\r\n     To carry out our research and training goals the PIs have assembled a team of scientists with diverse backgrounds in systematics and arachnology and a demonstrated history of successful collaborative research efforts. Combining research efforts to tackle these taxonomic problems provides the empirical basis for our multi-ordinal and multidisciplinary approach for training doctoral students in the broadest possible way. Lab rotations and collaboration among the multiple investigators participating in the projects, in addition to the joint field expeditions, also contribute to this synergism.  Research results will be disseminated in high impact portals such as Encyclopedia of Life and Tree of Life.  Online interactive identification tools will also be produced.",
