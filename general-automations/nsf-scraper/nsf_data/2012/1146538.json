 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Bristol Bay Campus (BBC) proposes to strengthen UAF BBC's Environmental Science (ES) and Sustainable Energy (SE) applied science programs. The ES and SE programs were created in response to a community need to enhance STEM knowledge and capacity in order to develop local sustainable solutions to environmental and energy challenges brought on by a rapidly changing world economy and climate.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to improve STEM interest, enrollment, graduation, employment and ultimately to reclaim a sense of stewardship to our place, our land, or Nunaput in Yup'ik, among Native Alaskans in the Bristol Bay region.   UAF BBC directly serves over 30 remote villages in southwest Alaska and a growing number of rural Alaska Native communities via distance education.  Nunaput will nurture students using a culturally appropriate suite of activities aimed towards student academic success.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is in the ES and SE degree development and their potential benefit to the local community. The Broader impacts may be realized in the preparation of Alaska Native students in these STEM areas as researchers, educators and citizen scientists.",

The project significantly strengthened UAF BBC&rsquo;s Environmental Science and Sustainable Energy applied science programs and broadened participation of underrepresented groups in these fields. The project achieved all four individual goals, which were (1) to build rural Alaska Native STEM capacity in higher education and employment in the regionally relevant disciplines of Environmental Science and Sustainable Energy, (2) to provide more opportunity for Alaska Native students to experience active, inquiry-based learning and real-world problem solving on place-based research topics of most concern in their communities, (3) to increase faculty capacity in the integration of rigorous research techniques into applied science education projects towards meaningful and innovative results to the research community and to the local Alaska Native communities, and (4) to stimulate student interest, stewardship and teacher proficiency in teaching STEM topics at the K-12 level across rural Alaska which will prepare the next generation of STEM college students.</p>\n<p>The project goals were met through the implementation of many elements, including the &ldquo;NUNAPUT Stewardship through Science&rdquo; scholarship and mentoring program, Math Academy support program, student internships, development of new stewardship courses, enhancements of lab intensives, development of new academic programs, support of undergraduate research, faculty professional development activities, and development of STEM continuing education opportunities for K-12 teachers. On average, about 13 students participated in the NUNAPUT scholarship program every semester. Stewardship projects of the NUNAPUT scholars ranged from studying local ecosystems to researching locally relevant renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions, and the results of these projects were disseminated through conference presentations, reports, and community seminars. In addition to peer-reviewed publications, program faculty and students delivered over 100 conference presentations throughout the duration of this project.</p>\n<p>This innovative project promoted the development of a globally engaged workforce in rural Alaska communities. This was done by promoting local stewardship and climate change adaptation through experiential learning of scientific methods, data collection, and presentation skills aimed at finding place-based solutions to environmental and energy challenges. The blending of scientific methodology with place-based content, traditional knowledge, and regional learning styles promoted student interest and confidence in STEM disciplines. The program activities led to higher student retention and academic success.</p>\n<p>This project advanced scientific knowledge by building capacity within participating individuals and by applying scientific methods and leading technology in the unique and relatively unexplored area of Bristol Bay. Dissemination of results by faculty and students was an integral component. By focusing on environment and energy, this project addressed not just regional, but also global issues. Knowledge has been advanced by UAF BBC faculty and undergraduate students by conducting place-based research on relevant environmental and energy issues identified within their own rural communities. Further, this project assisted in meeting the regional and statewide demand for skilled science technicians, technologists, and specialists in the areas of natural resource management, fisheries, conservation, environmental assessment, energy efficiency retrofit and weatherization, green construction, and renewable energy installation and maintenance.
