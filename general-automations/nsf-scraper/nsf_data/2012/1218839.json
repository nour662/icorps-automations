 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, nano-enabled thermoelectric devices have attracted much attention for cost-effective embedded (hot spot) and portable cooling applications such as in high-performance integrated circuits, lasers, and medical and food chillers. However, efficiency of this novel technology, to a large extent, relies on: (i) Fine-tuning the basic material parameters (Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity) that are strong function of coupled structural-electronic processes at the nanoscale; and ii) System-level optimization considering the geometry, substrates, and contacts. These critical and challenging tasks have not yet been fully addressed and assessed experimentally and, therefore, demand a careful numerical investigation. As a response to this need, the goal of this research is to design nano-enabled embedded thermoelectric cooling modules offering improved efficiency and the ability to be operated at high temperature. For this purpose, a multiscale simulator will be integrated, where the material and device parameters will be obtained atomistically using first-principles and molecular dynamics simulations and will eventually be used in the system level design and optimization. The multiscale simulation platform will expose new degrees-of-freedom available at nanoscale (such as engineering density-of-states, effective mass, structural relaxation, localized disorder, surface-to-volume ratio, internal polarization, and non-degeneracy) and create transformative design routes for boosting efficiency and reliability of thermoelectric systems.\r\n\r\nThermoelectric technology offers high power density and fast response, is vibration and noise free, small and lightweight, and environmentally safe. Besides applications in embedded and potable coolers, thermoelectric devices are used as power sources for remote telecommunication, navigation, and radioisotope generator for space vehicles, and has potential promise in heat scavenging in vehicle exhaust system. Solid-state thermoelectrics will thus diversify and help sustain the growth in the global semiconductor market. The project also encompasses significant education and outreach activities. Graduate students will be engaged in software development, integration, and data analysis. In addition, senior design projects will be developed for undergraduate students. The simulator, along with the documentation, tutorials, case studies, will be freely distributed under the GNU public use license and an educational version (with a graphical user interface) will be deployed on NSF?s nanoHUB.org for the broader community for use in research and class-room teaching activities.",

However, efficiency of this novel technology, largely, relies on: (i) Fine-tuning the basic material parameters that are strong function of coupled structural-electronic processes at the nanoscale; and (ii) System-level optimization considering the geometry, substrates, and contacts. These issues have not been fully assessed experimentally and, therefore, demand a careful numerical investigation. As a response to this need, in this project, we have mainly worked on the following Thrusts:</p>\n<p>i) Develop a multiscale simulator for modeling non-classical nanostructured Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>, nitride and ZnO thermoelectric devices with the capability of handling millions of atoms.</p>\n<p>ii) Investigate the competing effects of atomicity, various <em>long-range</em> built-in structural and electrostatic fields, size-quantization, and operating temperature on the performance of TE devices.</p>\n<p>iii) Explore new design space for improved TE efficiency and performance.</p>\n<p>iv) Involving the undergraduate (REU) students: (a) Design an <em>accelerated</em> GUI&nbsp;with interactive features for the multiscale&nbsp;TE simulator and made it freely accessible on NSF&rsquo;s nanoHUB.org for the broader community for use in research and teaching activities. (b) Explore and use advanced synthesis and printing technologies for the&nbsp;creation and characterization of a prototypical TE module.</p>\n<p>Listed below are some of the key Outcomes from this project.</p>\n<p>1) An educational version of the <em>Multiscale Modeling of Thermoelectric Cooler (multiscaleTEC) </em>software<em> </em>was published on NSF&rsquo;s nanoHUB (URL: https://nanohub.org/tools/multiscaletec).</p>\n<p>2) Detailed numerical investigation of the performance of Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3&nbsp;</sub><em>nanowire</em>&nbsp;based thermoelectric devices suggests that active hotspot cooling of as much as 23 &deg;C with a high heat flux is achievable using such low-dimensionality structures. However, it has been observed that <em>thermal and electrical contact resistances</em>, which are quite large in nanostructures, play a critical role in determining the cooling range and lead to significant performance degradation that must be addressed before these devices can be deployed in such&nbsp;applications.</p>\n<p>3) Another simulator called <em>Monte Carlo Phonon Transport Simulator</em> (MCPT) was created and uploaded on nanoHUB.org for free-access and use by the community (URL: https://nanohub.org/tools/mcpt). MCPT calculates lattice thermal conductivity by solving Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) numerically&nbsp;using a particle-based&nbsp;Monte Carlo simulation. The&nbsp;<em>modified valence force-field&nbsp;model</em><em>&nbsp;</em>used here accounts for effects of strain and phonon-phonon interactions. In addition, diffusive boundary scattering of phonons due to rough surfaces is modeled via the use of Gaussian distribution and the Bechmann-Kirchhoff surface scattering formalism for electromagnetic waves.</p>\n<p>4) As compared to the empirically fitted model, the thermal con&shy;ductivity calculated using the MCPT simulator deviates by about 8% (~18 W/m-K). Also, it was observed that with the increase of lattice temperature the diffusive boundary scattering increases as the percentage of phonons with larger wavevector increases. The observation can be useful in designing materials with low thermal conductivity for TE cooling purposes.</p>\n<p>5) First-principles DFT based method was used to investigate the piezoelectric polarization coefficient of ZnO nanowires. The study indicates that piezoelectric coefficient for bare ZnO nanowires is a highly diameter sensitive parameter, where free boundary leads the surface atoms to move towards the center of the nanowire. The results indicate small size nanowires have a promising potential in the application of <em>energy harvesting</em>.</p>\n<p>6) Tensile strain in MoS<sub>2</sub> based electron conducting channels for TE use reduces phonon energy for E+ and E- Raman modes, energy bandgap, and electron effective mass, which modulate the electron density, velocity, and conductivity. For both modes, the current peaks at ~4% of applied strain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7) The synthesis of <em>n</em>-Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>, <em>n</em>-Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>, and <em>p</em>-Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> thermoelectric nanoplates was carried out using a microwave-stimulated reaction between chalcogen and pnictogen complexes formed in an organic solvent. These two complexes reacted to precipitate black chalcogen-pnictogen nanoplates. It was observed, in one case, that a black precipitate already began to form even before the solution was microwaved. These plates were then examined under SEM to determine their size and shape. The nanoplates were then dissolved in another solvent producing printer ink.</p>\n<p>8) A characterization system was constructed that allows a straightforward measurement of ZT figure-of-merit of TE modules with minimal heat loss. The various parts employed in this system include wood blocks as chassis, copper plate and blocks using a 3-D printer, thin-film heater, Arduino Uno, two linear actuators, an H-Bridge motor controller, a 12-volt battery, two voltage divider circuits, a potentiometer, and a liquid CPU cooler.</p>\n<p>The award has fully/partially supported the publication of 2 freely-accessible software on NSF&rsquo;s nanoHUB cyberinfrastructure, 1 book chapter, 4 journal articles, and 6 refereed conference papers. Results from this project have been presented in about 10 technical seminars/workshops.
