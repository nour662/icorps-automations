The host scientist is Ryan Lowe.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit of the research project is generate new fundamental understandings of the hydrodynamics (i.e. waves, tides, and longshore current) governing transport between coral reefs and the coastal ocean.  The hydrodynamics of the system govern biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous in benthic systems and determine the fate of contaminants in reef communities.  Research  questions are being answered using two approaches: numerical modeling of Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii and field work on coral reefs around Western Australia.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Kaneohe Bay is a coral reef lagoon system located on Oahu, Hawaii.  The coral reef system has four significant features: a reef flat, a reef crest, the lagoon, and two outflow channels.  Flow is forced over the reef crest and reef flat by waves, is circulated through the lagoon, and then exits through the channels.  Previous studies have shown that the flow on the reef crest and reef flat is driven by wave forcing.  It was also shown that the outflow through the two channels is correlated to the offshore wave height.  Although these flows are understood, it is unknown what forces drive flow within the lagoon.\n\n The purpose of this project was to determine what forces control flow in the lagoon of Kaneohe Bay.  It was found that the major driving forces are horizontal buoyancy gradients and wind stress.  Horizontal buoyancy gradients are influenced by freshwater inflow from streams and submarine groundwater discharge.  The gradients increase when there is more freshwater inflow, which is caused by increased precipitation.  The horizontal buoyancy gradients create a two layered flow with fresh, less dense water on the surface, and salty, denser water on the bottom.  This two layered flow governs the transport and residence time in the lagoon.   \n\n A simple 1-D model can be used to model and predict the two layered flow when there is a strong horizontal buoyancy gradient in the lagoon; however, to truly understand the complex interaction between this two layered flow and the wave driven flow on the reef, a more complex 3-D model is needed.  This model is currently being altered to account for horizontal buoyancy gradients and freshwater inflow.  To further understand the flows in Kaneohe Bay, field experiments are being planned for January &ndash; March 2013.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mallory Barkdull"
