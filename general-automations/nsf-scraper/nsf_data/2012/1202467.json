An overall average of seventy-five percent (75%) of NCLSAMP participants will be retained in STEM baccalaureate programs within the Alliance. \r\n2. The pool of competent underrepresented graduates with STEM bachelor's degrees will have increased by 10%. \r\n3. The number of NCLSAMP participants who matriculate into STEM graduate programs will have increased by 10%. \r\n\r\nBuilding upon its successes in the implementation of cohort-based learning, collaborative instructional approaches and block-scheduling, the Alliance will help its members institutionalize and maintain high impact practices engaging a larger population of underrepresented students into STEM-learning communities. Best practices that will continue and expand based on Phase I experience include Facilitated Study Groups, Research Skills Development Workshops, and Mentored Research Experiences for Undergraduates.",
