It will take place at the University of Washington in Seattle, June 11-12, 2012.\r\nThe workshop will consist of three different mini-courses, taught by three noted experts in the field of stability. Margaret Beck(Heriott-Watt and Boston University) will present introductory lectures providing a common background to the audience members. Bjorn Sandstede (Brown University) will demonstrate the use of the softwareAUTO for stability applications, and Walter Strauss (Brown University) will examine different aspects of nonlinear and orbital stability.\r\n\r\nStability plays an essential role in many branches of science and engineering, including several aspects of fluid mechanics, high-speed\r\ntransmission of information, and feasibility of MHD fusion devices. The objective of the workshop is to give an overview of current\r\nstate-of-the-art methods for examining stability, as well as to present some widely applicable new techniques. The format will consist\r\nof three invited speakers giving a series of lectures at a level aimed at graduate students but useful for researchers from a variety of\r\ndisciplines, such as mathematics, engineering, biology, etc.",
