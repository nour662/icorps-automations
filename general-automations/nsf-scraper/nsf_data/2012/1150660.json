 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Roseanne Sension of the University of Michigan along with her graduate students plan to use ultrafast spectroscopy to study the ring-opening reactions of systems central to a number of natural and synthetic  photoswitches. Most of these systems contain a six-member ring that opens to form a helical chain-like molecule. In the work planned here the properties of light pulses, the nature of the environment, and the chemical substitution pattern around the ring will be used as parameters to understand the molecular and chemical basis for control of the ring-opening reactions.  The investigations will also explore the way in which optical pulses may be sculpted to control the dynamics and thus the yield of the ring-opening reactions central to these photoswitches. \r\n\r\nThis work exposes graduate and undergraduate students in physics and chemistry to state-of-the-art research in chemical physics and optical physics. The results of the research are integrated into the undergraduate physical chemistry curriculum through involvement of researchers in curriculum development and through the use of \"molecular movies,\" simulations of molecular dynamics based on the results of ultrafast spectroscopic measurements, which connect macroscopic properties to the dynamics of chemical systems.",

Light-activated molecular isomerization can be harnessed to develop and power such molecular scale devices.  A chromophore in the molecule absorbs light and initiates action. The 1,3-cyclohexadiene  chromophore is a reversible system capable of optically activated ring-opening and ring-closing reactions. This chromophore is a key element in a range of actual and proposed optical switches, as well as the photoactive chromophore for in vivo vitamin D synthesis.

The observed lifetimes with a-phellandrene longer than either a-terpinene and cyclohexadiene is contrary to theoretical predictions and points to an alternate reaction coordinate with less involvement of the ethylenic backbone.  In agreement with this finding, studies probing the excited state decay of 7-dehydrocholesterol demonstrate that excess energy placed in the ethylenic backbone has no influence on the excited state ring-opening reaction.\n\nThe influence of substitution on the ground state conformational relaxation was also studied.  The small size of the bare cyclohexadiene molecule enables the hexatriene product to access a wide range of conformations rapidly and cool down slowly.

Ultrafast transient absorption measurements on CH2BrI where there are two distinct bond cleavage pathways breaking the C-I bond or the C-Br bond, branching between ring-closure and double bond isomerization in cis-stilbene, and branching between potentially distinct excited state pathways in the 7-dehydrocholesterol ring-opening were all investigated.
