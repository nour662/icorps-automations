 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Capacity Building project is designed to make the Cornell Teacher Education Program, which prepares students for New York state certification in K-12 agriculture, secondary biology, chemistry, physics, or earth science, grade 7-8 science, or grade 5-6 science, a viable candidate for a future Noyce Phase I Scholarship award. The Cornell University team, from the Department of Entomology, Department of Horticulture, and the Paleontological Research Institution, are partnering with Moravia Central School District, Tully Central School District, Brooklyn Academy of Science and the Environment, the Cannon River STEM School, Boyce Thompson Institute, Cornell Plantations, Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Cornell Outdoor Education, and the Mohonk Preserve.  Targeted initiatives are addressing teacher recruitment, teacher preparation, and teacher induction support.\r\n\r\nThe project's theme is \"science for all\" which summarizes the goal of nurturing creative and passionate scientists while fostering the development of scientific literacy for everyone to inform their decision making on issues of personal health, safety and public policy.  The project is organized around the specific idea that local natural environments are among the best classrooms for learning in the natural and physical science disciplines.  Taking science outdoors is leading to better engagement in science, for teachers and students, improvements in health, a better understanding of the \"messy\" nature of real science, and an appreciation of the power of interdisciplinary approaches to scientific problems.\r\n\r\nThe back-to-nature approach for science education is having a broad impact because it is accessible and effective for all students, including those living in more \"built-up\" areas of the country, and those with disabilities that challenge their access and success.  Of special note for aiding in the success of the project is the Professional Development School, in which university faculty and school teachers work together to design and implement learning opportunities for pre-service teachers and for themselves.  Also contributing to project success is the Cornell New Teacher Support Corps, a group composed of highly effective retired or part-time science teachers, who are serving as mentors for the project alums.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSoon after the original proposal ?Partnerships to Prepare Science Teachers for Inclusive, Back-to-nature Education? was funded, Cornell University inexplicably closed its Department of Education making most of the proposed educational training efforts impossible to initiate.  To compensate, the PI?s were involved in helping establish a strong Education minor, and negotiating an agreement with a neighboring college, Ithaca College (IC), so that Cornell education minors receive expedited consideration of their applications to the teacher preparation programs at IC.  \"Because great science requires great teachers\" an ?Excellence in STEM Teaching by Undergraduates? Noyce award was established to recognize the undergraduates in STEM fields who contribute to teaching at Cornell through undergraduate teaching assistantships and tutoring.  Eighteen students were nominated by faculty for the award, and three received teaching awards in a ceremony.  Although the PI?s have worked with Deans to formalize this undergraduate STEM teaching award through the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University, the College has not been willing to continue this form of student recognition.\n\nIn 2015, the thrust of the grant was redirected toward ?Naturalist Outreach Program: Teaching scientific outreach and spreading the ethos of scientific engagement beyond the university?.  The emphasis was on the PI?s approach that training college undergraduates how to do effective scientific outreach greatly enhances the probability that these students will go on to become STEM teachers or to continue to do informal science education that communicates the value of science to the public through their careers. Major activities included a 2.5 day professional development workshop on ?Improving undergraduate education through science outreach? which attracted 24 faculty participants from 16 different academic institutions.

Additionally, over 60 of Cornell?s Insectapalooza volunteers were interviewed after the event about their broad impact of being engaged in communicating science to the public.  Results demonstrate that the act of doing science outreach increases the perceived value of communicating to the public and interest in STEM teaching.  However, once there is broad cultural change in appreciation for the value of science outreach to the community among presenters, outreach training has a smaller impact on individual?s views. \n\nThe grant supported the production of five Naturalist Outreach STEM videos which are short scientifically accurate videos that illuminate powerful concepts about ways of understanding nature, ecology, and biodiversity that are engaging, beautiful, and inspiring.
