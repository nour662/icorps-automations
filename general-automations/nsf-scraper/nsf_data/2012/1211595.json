 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clusters of galaxies are important probes of cosmology and are key players in unraveling the mysteries behind galaxy formation and evolution and the development of large scale structure in the Universe.  These galaxy clusters are teeming with activity as the recurring infall of dark matter dominated halos drives large scale winds, shocks, turbulence and entropy discontinuities in the intracluster medium (ICM).  The diffuse, hot ICM, comprising about 90% of the normal cluster matter, carries the imprint of the recent cluster assembly history, provides a cosmological mass metric through its dynamical/thermodynamical state, transports metals and entropy, transforms galactic star formation, and offers a laboratory into basic fluid and plasma processes in low density media.  Relativistic, nonthermal plasmas produced by cluster-wide processes and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) serve as an important tool for understanding the ICM's evolving dynamical state.  Exploiting this tool requires a rich observational base, a good understanding of the physics of the interactions between thermal and nonthermal plasmas, and effective ways to translate between that physics and observations.  To that end, the investigators have designed an ambitious, coordinated theoretical and observational program that will leverage major technical advances in both numerical simulations and telescope systems.\r\n\r\nThe aims of this project include a much improved understanding of (1) how large scale flows and turbulence are established in the ICM and evolve from kiloparsec to megaparsec scales, (2) how magnetic fields develop and then reveal and feed back to ICM evolution, (3) how relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) are both products of and diagnostics for the dynamic ICM, and (4) how AGN outflows physically interact with the ICM and serve as diagnostics of local flows.\r\n\r\nEducationally, this project includes training of undergraduate and graduate students in both cutting-edge science and the development of innovative data analysis and numerical simulation techniques.  The investigators will also be active in public education, including work with the local planetarium, K-12 science and community groups.",
