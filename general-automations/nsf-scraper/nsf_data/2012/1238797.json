 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Initiation Award entitled -Biochemical Basis of Interaction between Keratin-Derived Materials and Schwann Cells - seeks to explore the specific mechanisms by which the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) keratin class of proteins interacts with Schwann cells and induces intracellular changes. \r\n\r\nThis project has three goals. First, there is a need to refine the understanding and classification of ECM proteins such as keratins. Long considered as only structural in nature, recent research has shown numerous regulatory activities for ECM proteins. While several classifications of keratins are known to exist, there is a dearth of knowledge to their specific roles and their three-dimensional structures. Second, this project will elucidate the cell surface mechanism by which interaction with keratin leads to nuclear changes in Schwann cells, particularly in regards to how Schwann cells react to chemical stimulants in their microenvironments. Cellular signaling attributed to keratin is not well-studied and could lead to a transformative understanding of the role of these biomolecules in regulatory processes of an organism.  Third, the project will continue to study structure and function of Schwann cells in collaboration with the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. The goal is to investigate how the state of keratin impacts cellular response. This project has a strong educational component, involving undergraduate students in a meaningful way.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis proposal for the NSF HBCU-UP Research Initiation Award (RIA) has investigated the specific mechanism(s) by which the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) keratin class of proteins interacts with Schwann cells and induces intracellular changes.  The research has shown that keratin promotes Schwann cell growth, adheres tightly to Schwann cells, and induces Schwann cells to migrate toward concentrations of keratin.  Additionally, some biomolecules (but not keratin) were shown to induce differing results on Schwann cell metabolism depending on whether those molecules were coated on a plate before the Schwann cells were adhered or whether those molecules were added to media after the cells had adhered to the plate. \n\n \n\nThese results have supported the value of this project.  First, there is now reproducible proof that keratins, long considered to be of only structural value to cells, can play a role in regulation of cell metabolism.  Structural proteins have value now not only in generating the architecture necessary for regeneration by serving as a scaffold, but they can also help promote the growth and differentiation of cells as the regeneration occurs along the scaffold.  Second, this study continues to search for the cellular receptor that transmits the keratin signal inside the cell and nucleus to generate its effects.  Although not yet elucidated, there are several candidate receptors now being investigated.  Once this has been completed, there will be a better understanding of how cells signal to each other to promote regeneration.  This can then be further refined to improve regenerative techniques, presumably allowing greater and more varied wounds/defects to be treated. \n\n \n\nFinally, this project has brought resulted in a solid collaboration between Wake Forest University and Winston Salem State University.  WFU is home to one of the world\u00c6s premiere research facilities for regenerative medicine; this project has enabled over a dozen undergraduate students from WSSU to work within WFU facilities and meet and learn from WFU researchers.  Allowing students the opportunity to interact with world-class equipment and researchers can inspire a lifetime of passion for scientific inquiry.  The closer ties between the two institutions foster an increasingly inclusive culture in STEM fields, promoting the study of science to disadvantaged and underrepresented groups.  Ultimately, the scientific work will be enhanced by the diversity of researchers and the individual strengths each scientist brings with them.\n\n \n\nDuring the lifetime of this project, results of experiments have opened new avenues of investigation and enabled the PI to build an increasingly larger and more vital lab.  Over a dozen students from minority backgrounds have contributed to the project and gained experience in a variety of facets of scientific work.  These include conducting assays, analyzing data, developing techniques, writing about the research, presenting their own research, gaining confidence in discussing research with both peers and other interested parties, and applying for graduate and professional schools with a solid background in the field of regenerative medicine.  The project data itself has lead to the PI expanding capability for research, including acquiring the first microscope in the region that allows total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) studies; collaborators can now come to this lab to explore detection of single molecule interactions.  PI has hosted training sessions and invited over a score of researchers to attend.  Additional collaborations are underway involving other institutions and potentially biotech industries.  Ultimately, this project is continuing to expand the knowledge of how keratin can be used to regenerate severed or damaged peripheral nerves, which has the potential to improve the quality of life of millions of people.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles Ebert"
