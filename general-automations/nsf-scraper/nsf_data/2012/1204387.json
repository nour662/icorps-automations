  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project studied contact structures, which are geometric structures arising from physics, on three-dimensional spaces which locally resemble Euclidean space (called 3-manifolds).\n\nOne major goal of this project was to understand the relationship between contact structures on 3-manifolds with boundary and invariants of the underlying 3-manifolds, using \"sutured\" versions of three Floer homology theories: instanton homology, monopole homology, and embedded contact homology.  In joint work with Baldwin, the PI defined new invariants of such contact structures as elements of the instanton and monopole theories, and showed that the monopole contact invariant is identical to one coming from Heegaard Floer homology; the former has very useful formal properties while the latter is easy to compute, so this correspondence has produced several useful applications.  Jointly with Kutluhan, the PI proved that sutured embedded contact homology is in fact an invariant of a contact 3-manifold, which was not previously known, and showed that it might be able to detect the shape of the space of all contact structures on the underlying manifold.  This may also be useful in proving strengthened versions of the Weinstein conjecture, a major theorem in contact dynamics.\n\nAnother goal was the study of Legendrian knots, a natural class of knots arising in the study of contact manifolds, using tools from Legendrian contact homology.  In joint work with Ng, Rutherford, Shende, and Zaslow, the PI defined a new Legendrian knot invariant called the \"augmentation category\" and showed that it is identical to an algebraic invariant arising from the seemingly distant world of sheaf theory; this correspondence has already been used to produce interesting new results in both subjects.
