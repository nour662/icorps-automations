 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance a class of manufacturing processes that are critical to the high technology economy of the United States through a unique academic / industry partnership that will advance manufacturing through science-based understanding and application of learning to systems used in a plurality of domestic industries spanning electronics, energy, and the environment.  These manufacturing processes utilize reactive plasma systems that are driven by radio frequency power sources. Specifically, this program will advance the knowledge of pulsed radio frequency heating to advance plasma assisted manufacturing capability for future technology manufacturing nodes.  Pulsed Radio Frequency (PRF) heating of these plasmas demonstrates unprecedented dynamic range in its ability to modify plasma chemistry and plasma/surface interactions.  The advancement of stable, manufacturing worthy systems that employ PRF will enable new processes for applications of broad national interest including integrated circuit fabrication, energy production, and medical applications.  \r\n\r\nThis project will advance the understanding of plasma response to transient RF systems by correlating measured plasma conditions via a suite of time resolved diagnostics to waveform-resolved voltage, current, and phase measurements made with an in-line RF measurement system capable of resolving the transient response of the electrical system to levels of accuracy previously not available to the scientific community.  This project will leverage this unique academic/industry partnership to develop educational modules that will be incorporated into not only an established STEM program in plasma science, but also into freely accessible continuing education modules for mid-career technologists considering a focus in low temperature plasma applications in their profession.  Finally, this project will develop instructional, visually stimulating media designed to educate high-school level science teachers on the application of plasma science in an array of industries that are tangible to the typical high school student, such as microelectronics, display technology, and photovoltaic fabrication.",

The ability to measure critical plasma parameters during a pulsed RF cycle were advanced and these measurements were used to directly elucidate the source of electrical impedance transcients induced during pulse power operation.  Novel methods for measuring sheath characteristics and electron density during pulse transients were discovered.  This learning was further applied to advanced power delivery systems for the reliable delivery of pulsed RF power on manufacturing systems.\n\nThe broader impact of this project was equally substantial.  Graduate students at NCSU were introduced to the nuances of basic research in industry through direct collaboration with engineers at MKS Instruments during extended visits by MKS engineers to the NCSU campus.  Research directives were centered on the advance of basic science with an eye on how these findings would directly impact next generation engineering of plasma reactors.  Engineers at MKS Instruments were likewise \"re-introduced\" to the benefit of fundamental research in solving industry challenges in both an existing and future product base during extended visits by NCSU researchers to the MKS facility in Rochester New York.  This greatly enhanced the research endeavors at both institutions and reinforced the mutual benefit of university / industry collaboration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/08/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven C Shannon"
