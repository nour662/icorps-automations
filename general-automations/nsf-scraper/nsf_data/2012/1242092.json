 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for 25-30 participants of the third Workshop for\r\nWomen in Probability to be held October 14-16, 2012 at Duke University. All of those receiving support will be young female researchers (graduate students or recent PhD's) and will be recruited from a wide variety of institutions. This conference features talks on current exciting research areas by ten women probabilists, who are leading researchers in their field. Topics will include mathematical biology, stochastic partial differential equations, fractional Brownian motion, random matrices, dynamical systems, interacting particle systems, stochastic networks, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and randomized algorithms. Participants will have an opportunity to interact with the speakers in a way that is difficult at a large national or international meeting, and to give poster presentations on their own research. This conference will foster the formation of networks of a support structure for female mathematicians at the beginning of their careers. The young researchers will have the chance to network with their peers as well as more senior women in their field, and to discuss the challenges they face in graduate school and early professional life. The interpersonal contacts resulting from this meeting will help guide them through early career transitions, which will ultimately improve the retention of talented women in the mathematics work force.",
