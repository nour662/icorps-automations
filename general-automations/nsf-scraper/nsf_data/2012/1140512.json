 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to design a set of comprehensive, flexible and modularized course materials and pedagogical tools for basic modern cryptography to be used in a dedicated course or courses that include a cryptography component.  This work can be used in a breadth-first approach and permits instructors to teach selected topics in-depth.  Students get familiar with state-of-the-art  cryptography, acquire basic knowledge and skills, and are well-prepared to approach cryptographic applications with confidence.   Major activities include (1) developing a web-based tutorial on cryptography, (2) implementing software tools and user guides for the software tools that support the proposed course materials, and (3) designing an environment for students to perform semester-long programming projects and to visualize important elements in cryptography.   The course materials and software tools are available on the web.  \r\n\r\nThis project has two major components. The first one is a well-balanced approach with an intuitive and comprehensive web-based tutorial, a programming environment and a visualization system.  Instructors may teach cryptography with a breadth-first approach and discuss selected topics in-depth, and students have a programming environment and use the visualization system to learn the inner workings of each algorithm.  The second one is an extendable system that uses a layered approach and plug-ins.  The system can serve as a programming/demonstration platform and as a debugging tool for instructors and students to implement their own demonstrations and visualizations.  The project has a broad impact on teaching, learning and practicing cryptographic topics, and has the potential to transform the traditional dry and formal methodology into an interactive, hands-on, and visualization-based approach.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project addresses an important issue in cryptography pedagogy.  We are motivated to take a more comprehensive approach that can unify theory, hands-on practice and visualization together.  To this end, we designed six visualization tools for the following ciphers: DESvisual for the DES cipher, AESvisual for the AES cipher, ECvisual for ciphers based on elliptic curves over finite fields, RSAvisual for the RSA cipher, SHAvisual for the SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm), and VIGvisual for the classic Vigenere cipher.  These tools have been used and evaluated twice in an Introduction to Cryptography course at Michigan Technological University.  Our findings were summarized in five papers published in top-tier conferences (e.g., ACM SIGCSE, ACM ITiCSE and ASEE).  A web-based tutorial is also under construction in which the basics of each cipher and its user guide will be discussed in an intuitive, non-mathematical and understandable way.  All tools support the Linux, MacOS and Windows operating systems.  Materials, which include the software, papers, evaluation forms, and web-based tutorial, are available to the general public at http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~shene/NSF-4/index.html.\n\nEach tool has a Demo mode and a Practice mode, and some tools have more modes.  With the Demo mode, the user is able to see the flow of operations of a particular cipher.  The user may choose to step through each important step of the cipher, or use animation, if it is available, to see the encryption and decryption process.  This is very useful for the user to learn and visualize the details and yet keep an eye on the global flow of the cipher.  The Demo mode is also convenient to be used in a classroom setting for the instructor to teach and demonstrate the details of a cipher.  The Practice mode is designed for the user to practice the encryption and decryption process.  In this mode, the user enters the answer to each step of a cipher and the tool verifies it and indicates if the answer is correct or not.  The user may advance to the next step if she/he chooses not to answer and ask for the correct one.  Additionally, based on the nature of the tools, some may report the answers, including the number of trials, to the instructor for grading and evaluation purpose.\n\nThese tools were evaluated in various ways, including simple descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and cluster analysis.  Evaluation findings showed that our tools were effective in classroom and for self-study and that helped students learn the indicated ciphers efficiently.  Moreover, we also found that reactions from students from different disciplines (e.g., computer science, electrical and computer engineering, chemistry, biology, materials science, etc.) did not show a significant difference.  Therefore, we believe that this project has provided educators with a set of robust materials for many courses that involve cryptography.  These tools also offer an opportunity for the students to learn and the ciphers in an effective way with a chance to practice encryption and decryption easily with error checking.  Additionally, data sets collected from various evaluations will be analyzed further.  A framework of our approach was published in the ACM ICER 2015 conference as a poster.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ching-Kuang Shene"
