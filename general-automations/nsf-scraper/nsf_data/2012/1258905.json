The aim of these frameworks include enabling market mechanisms for security based on sound metrics, assessing the resilience of critical infrastructure against nation-state threats, and evaluating the effectiveness of asymmetric cyber operations against adaptive organizations.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will raise awareness across the many communities increasingly involved with cybersecurity and will encourage greater participation in discussion of critical issues at the intersection of public policies for cybersecurity and science of security.",
