 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will bring together leading researchers from relevant academic, commerical, and practice-oriented communities to explore fundamental issues concerning the emergence of radically new developments in learning technology and its applications in higher education. Developments in online instruction and technology-based innovation in classroom interactions are changing how academics think about teaching and learning. An example is the recent emergence of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), where the primary focus is on delivery of educational experiences through the Web to global audiences. Digital technologies are also changing teaching in face-to-face settings, with experiments at many institutions in flipped classroom approaches and blended instructional methods.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the workshop is to generate a rough 5 - 10 year prioritized research agenda for technology-based teaching/learning approaches that are effective and feasible to scale. There are very deep issues to be explored in the new educational techniques, issues which must be explored if such techniques are not to be pursued blindly. This workshop will help lead the way to understanding the developing online educational practices in the light of research into their effectiveness. The hope is that a framework will be produced that will lead to research that facilitates the development of high quality, economically-feasible, educational practices with these new and still emerging technologies.",
