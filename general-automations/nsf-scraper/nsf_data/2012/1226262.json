The workshop will center on several important areas of energy conversion at elevated pressures: 1) bio-renewable processing: gasification, biodiesel, and lignocellulose and 2) process intensification for lower energy and/or feedstock usage.  Approximately 10 speakers will be invited to share their latest research and provide their insight regarding developing trends and potentially fruitful research directions.  In terms of the broader impacts, students at various levels of education (from undergraduate to graduate to postdoctoral) will be aided by this proposed workshop. This will help educate and motivate the next generation of researchers and educators. Students from underrepresented groups will be encouraged to attend. At the conclusion, the PI will write a detailed report about the various presentations and panel discussions for limited distribution and for public distribution on his website. The presentations and the panel discussions will yield a section on the major challenges in energy within the high-pressure community. The report will provide valuable information and insights that could help guide future grand challenges and research directions.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a timely forum on the application of high pressure processes to important sustainability issues.   In addition, the participants will provide insight into new research directions, and they will describe potential applications along with milestones for their realization.  The results will be disseminated through a detailed report, which will be posted on the PI?s website.",
