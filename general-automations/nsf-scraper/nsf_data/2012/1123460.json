 "awd_abstract_narration": "Does the dialect you speak determine how you hear the speech around you? With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Tyler Kendall and Dr. Valerie Fridland will conduct twenty-four months of linguistic research investigating how vowel perception is affected by dialect experience. Utilizing web-based perception experiments to gain participation from across the U.S., and recording speech from a subset of these participating subjects, the project will investigate what links exist between the perception and production of vowel categories (e.g., \"ee\" and \"ih\") and how these categories are mediated by variation at the level of the community and the individual. In particular, the research will examine whether distinctive regional vowel changes that affect three main dialects of American English (Northern, Southern and Western) are contributing to greater diversity in speech processing, in addition to speech production, and whether the degree to which individuals show such vowel changes themselves affects their speech processing in relation to their community norms. To gain a better understanding of the impact of social influences on speech perception, this research will investigate whether listeners' categorization of vowels is also affected by their expectations regarding learned social distinctions among speakers, such as regional affiliation or gender.\r\n\r\nIncreasing evidence suggests that socially derived linguistic variation provides more than simply clues to social identity, and, in fact, plays a pivotal role in the actual processing and decoding of the speech signal itself. Research in this area should prove to have applied benefits such as informing educational approaches to non-native language/dialect populations and also to the development of voice recognition technologies. Further, comparative examination of the productive and perceptual range of speakers affected by different dialect experiences will inform both speech and hearing science and sociolinguistic research, contributing to basic theories about the nature of speech processing and of sound change.",

The project has yielded several other significant findings, including a range of findings relating the perception of vowel category boundaries for mid front vowels (i.e. the vowels in words like bet and bait) both to a listener?s regional background and to her or his own productions of those vowel categories.  Our work has also shed new light on regional differences, as well as similarities, in vowel production patterns through a closer examination of how temporal and dynamic properties of vowels covary with more traditional measures of vowel identity.  Finally, we have uncovered further evidence for the role of social factors in perceptual processing, demonstrating that listeners respond differently to our experimental stimuli when being told the stimuli speaker is a local vs a non-local speaker.  As a part of this project, we have also uncovered important regional patterns in perception that do not simply align with traditional dialect maps.  With this research, we have expanded the boundaries of traditional sociolinguistic inquiry to include perceptual processing as an important component of dialect, something often assumed by work on sound change more generally, but rarely investigated.\n\n \n\nIn terms of intellectual import, our work has combined the field-based approaches and methods of sociolinguistic inquiry with the experimental approaches of speech science inquiry, allowing a marriage of two areas previously benefitting little from collaborative efforts.
