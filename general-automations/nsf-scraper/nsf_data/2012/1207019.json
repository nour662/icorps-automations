 "awd_abstract_narration": "ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1207019  \t         PI:  Weiss, Sharon\t ORG: Vanderbilt University\r\n\r\nTitle:  Multifunctional Hybrid Porous Nanoparticles for Controlled Drug Release\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Porous silicon (PSi) is a promising drug delivery vehicle owing to its tunable porosity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and exceptionally large specific surface area, which can be exploited for drug loading and controlled release.  Unlike liposomal or micellar drug delivery vehicles, PSi can be fabricated into a vast range of sizes and shapes by an imprinting technique recently developed by the PI.  The aim of this proposal is to explore multifunctional porous micro- and nanoparticles for the treatment of localized pathologies.  The specific objectives of the research are:  (1) understanding the impact of porous silicon particle (PSP) shape and size on cellular uptake and selectivity, (2) investigating smart surface attachment chemistries to enable intracellular, site-specific release of loaded therapeutic peptides, and (3) exploring the viability of an ultrasonically-induced drug release mechanism and piezoelectric-functionalized PSPs.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  This research combines scientific and engineering methods of the complementary disciplines of materials science, biomedical engineering, electrical engineering, and physics for the realization of a drug delivery platform capable of combating some of the most socially and economically devastating medical conditions.  The integrated educational goals of the plan involve the exposure of participating graduate and undergraduate researchers to the interdisciplinary nature of nanoscience and a team-based research atmosphere.  Member selection of the research team will emphasize increasing the participation of gender and ethnic minorities, as facilitated through coordination with the existing NSF-sponsored Vanderbilt-Fisk-Delaware State I-cubed program in materials science, the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and Engineering REU program, and the Vanderbilt chapters of SWE, NSBE, and SHPE.  Educational K-12 outreach will focus upon the development of inquiry-based learning activities to teach nanoscience concepts, to be shared during school visits and events at the Nashville Adventure Science Center.",
