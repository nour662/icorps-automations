The workshop will be held in conjunction with the fourth biennial conference of the International Association for Ecology and Health in Kunming, China, on 15-18 October 2012. The study of linkages between the environment and health of all species is an active and growing area of research that spans many disciplines. A primary goal of the conference is to provide educational and networking opportunities to students and to promote international collaborations within the field of ecohealth by bringing together world experts. The workshop will bring together current and potential future US and Chinese leaders in these fields around the common goal of furthering knowledge of mechanisms of survival and transport of pathogens in the environment.",
