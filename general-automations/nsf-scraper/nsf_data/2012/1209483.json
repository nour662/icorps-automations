 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Lisa Jung of the University of Colorado at Boulder to conduct a research project, entitled \"Exploring reproduction of an invertebrate filter feeder, the lancelet,\" during the summer of 2012 at Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology in Taipei, Taiwan with host scientist  Dr. Jr-Kai Yu.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to explore hormone-signaling pathways that regulate reproduction in the lancelet.  Lancelet is an important animal for studying vertebrate evolution because it serves as a missing link between invertebrates and vertebrates and it closely resembles the ancestor that gave rise to the vertebrates. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a crucial neuropeptide for regulating reproduction in vertebrates. Establishing the presence of a GnRH signaling pathway in this animal is the focus of this research and can provide undeniable proof that vertebrate GnRH and protostomian GnRH are, in fact, related and that GnRH is an ancient peptide that arose before the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to foster international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware American scientific workforce.",
