 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and demonstrate new virtual reality based applications for training medical residents and doctors in microsurgical techniques using the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) infrastructure and capabilities. The microsurgical virtual environment will enable students to learn the appropriate way of handling the soft tissues and developing the needed surgical skills needed to become competent micro surgeons.  Currently, surgical training is usually limited face-to-face situations where the expert surgeon and the trainees are in the same room performing intricate procedures, typically on cadavers. Since the experts in microsurgical techniques are not available in most parts of the country, such training is not readily available to many medical students. The new virtual reality based surgical training application will address this challenge by eliminating the need for the experts and the trainees to be co-located.  The GENI-enabled ultra-fast networking capabilities will be exploited to demonstrate a breakthrough application where a microsurgical expert in El Paso, Texas will teach medical residents in Oklahoma and Wisconsin. The application will exploit cloud-based framework to allow other sites to be easily integrated into the system so that trainees at many distributed locations can be trained simultaneously.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe ability to provide specialized surgical training to students in distributed locations through a virtual reality environment can revolutionize medical education outside of major centers of excellence.  The project will address issues of access to specialized health care by providing  specialist training and access to higher education without geographical limitations. This project also lays the foundation for more significant telemedicine applications in which doctors offer healthcare services including surgical and non surgical consultations which can include consultations with peer doctors and/or patients at distant locations.",
