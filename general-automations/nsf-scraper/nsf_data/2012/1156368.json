 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Lynnette Leidy Sievert (University of Massachusetts, Amherst), Dr. Laura Huicochea (El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Campeche, Mexico), and Dr. Daniel E. Brown (University of Hawaii, Hilo) will undertake research on cross-cultural variability of menopausal symptoms as reported and as measured bio-metrically for women  at midlife.  The goal is to better understand how women perceive and report symptoms in the context of social and material conditions, belief systems, and cultural institutions.  The study will compare symptoms at midlife across rural Mayan women, rural Mestizo women (of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry) living in the state of Campeche, and Mayan and Mestizo women living in the city of Campeche, Mexico.  One of the most cited studies of menopause among the Maya, carried out in the 1980s, reported a zero prevalence of hot flashes.  The aims of this study are to compare (1) symptom reports across Mayan and Mestizo groups living in rural and urban communities; (2) the frequency of biometrically measured hot flashes across the same groups; and (3) the level of concordance between symptom report and biometric measurement.  For example, rural Mayan women may not report hot flashes on questionnaires, but may show (via ambulatory monitoring) sweating consistent with hot flashes.   \r\n\r\nThe study is distinctive in its integration of in-depth interviews with semi-structured questionnaires, biomarkers of stress, and biometric methods to better understand the experience and perception of symptom experience.  If the results of this study show that the lived experience and report of hot flashes is shaped by cultural context, then differences in lived experience explain variation in cross-cultural hot flash reports.  In addition, we will better understand how women can improve their health, and their perception of health, in precarious conditions.  The results of the proposed research will inform local community and health care providers about the experiences of Mayan and Mestizo women at midlife. Funding this research, which is provided by both the NSF Cultural Anthropology Program and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering, also supports formalizes an international collaboration.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this study was to learn more about how women experience the menopausal transition.  In particular, we focused on hot flashes.  We chose Campeche, Mexico, because in past studies the Maya reported very low frequencies of hot flashes.  We wondered if hot flash frequencies were associated with ethnicity (Maya vs. non-Maya) or place of residence (urban vs. rural).  We also examined the concordance between hot flash report (in  interviews and on questionnaires) and physiological measures of hot flashes (using ambulatory monitors).  With in-depth interviews, we thought we could begin to understand why there is often a lack of agreement between hot flash report and biometric measures.  This lack of agreement has been found in a number of populations.\n\nWe recruited women aged 40-55 from four sites in the state of Campeche:  (1) Maya living in Ich-Ek and Suc Tuc, just 40 minutes from the city of Campeche n=78, (2) Maya living in rural, isolated communities in the municipality of Hopelchen, n=76, (3) non-Maya living in rural, isolated communities in the municipality of Calakmul, n=84, and (4) urban Maya and non-Maya women living in the city of Campeche, n=305.  In total, we interviewed 543 women. \n\nHot flash experience was assessed through open-ended interviews, checklist symptom reports, and ambulatory monitors that measured sweating on the upper chest and back of the neck.  We also measured women's height, weight, strength, and balance.  To classify each woman as Maya or not Maya, we used the last names, languages spoken, and places of birth of each woman, her parents, and her grandparents.  Even then, 40 women could not be clearly classified.\n\nWe learned that the word calor (\"heat\") was used for hot flashes, but also for a variety of other sensations related to the hot climate, infections (fever), emotional stress, and physical exertion.  Other Spanish words (sudores, sofocos, bochornos) are more specific to hot flashes, but women in Campeche used the general term calor (or calores) most often.  We were very careful to determine that we were measuring menopausal hot flashes when we spoke about calor.\n\nWe hypothesized that Maya ancestry and rural residence would decrease the likelihood of hot flashes.  We were surprised to find that Maya ancestry was not associated with hot flash report, and rural women were significantly more likely to report hot flashes.  In the city of Campeche, 50.4% of women who were not Maya reported hot flashes during the past two weeks compared to 47.9% of the Maya and 47.5% of those not classified.  In the rural communities, 67.9% of women in semi-rural Suc Tuc and Ich Ek, 64.5% in the isolated Maya villages of Hopelchen, and 60.2% in the isolated non-Mayan village of Calakmul reported hot flashes during the past two weeks.  As socioeconomic status increased, the likelihood of reporting hot flashes decreased, and as body mass index increased the likelihood of reporting hot flashes increased. \n\nWe found that the perceived stress score (a measure of acute stress) was a significant determinant of hot flashes in logistic regressions after controlling for other variables.  Our more chronic measure of stress, Epstein-Barr virus antibodies, was not associated with hot flashes.  We will expand this analysis with the open-ended, qualitative data to better understand the relationship between hot flashes and stress.\n\nA subset of women (n=154) wore a hot flash monitor.  There was a very low rate of concordance between objective measurement and subjective self-report of hot flashes.  We returned to the communities to ask women why they thought participants did not report hot flashes during the monitored period, and women attributed the lack of concordance to heat and humidity, but more so to their being unsure about whether or not the feeling of heat was a hot flash.  We found an interesting difference between asking women about hot flashes during the past two weeks, and asking whether a particular sensation should be labeled a hot flash.  Women can be confident that they are experiencing hot flashes, but unsure about specific sensations.\n\nIn the city of Campeche, 75% demonstrated at least one objective sternal hot flash (range 1 to 24) but only 38% of women subjectively reported a hot flash (range 1 to 13) during the 24-hour study period.  The semi-rural Maya women were more likely to both demonstrate and report hot flashes.  The rural isolated Maya communities in Calakmul had the lowest rates of objective hot flashes.  In contrast, the non-Maya women in the equally isolated communities of Hopelchen were very similar to women in the city of Campeche.  Further analysis of the qualitative data will help us understand differences in hot flash report and levels of concordance.\n\nThis investigation provided research experience for five U.S. undergraduate students, eight Mexican students, a visiting graduate student from Spain, and three visiting professors from other institutions in Mexico.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lynnette Leidy Sievert"
