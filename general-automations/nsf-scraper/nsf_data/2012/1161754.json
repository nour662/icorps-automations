 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates a new approach to protecting the reliability of digital communication and digital storage systems.  This approach takes advantage of recent work (by the research team and others) that formulates the \"encoding\" and \"decoding\" of data in terms of a novel graphical representation; this formulation has several advantages over existing techniques for insuring data integrity, including better performance at very low power and the absence of an 'error floor', i.e., the ability to consistently (and significantly) lower the decoded error probability with incremental expenditures of power.  The ultimate goal of the research is more reliable delivery of digital data, text, computer files, speech and audio signals, video, etc. - using devices that require less power (and thus have longer battery life) and shorter processing delay.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the research investigates the use of spatially coupled sparse codes - channel (error control) codes with a sparse parity check representation formed by coupling together a chain of small \"protographs\".  This approach, which was pioneered by the research team in the context of terminated low-density parity check convolutional codes, has recently been shown to possess a unique combination of properties - iterative decoding performance that approaches channel capacity and minimum distance that grows linearly with block length - as the code size gets large.  The research follows four tracks: (1) the design and analysis of low latency/memory decoding strategies; (2) decoded error probability performance guarantees; (3) the development and analysis of spatially coupled sparse codes with algebraic structure; and (4) the application of spatial coupling outside the immediate domain of channel coding, including cooperative diversity, compressed sensing, and multi-terminal source/channel coding.",

During the 3-year project period, 19 research papers were published in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings, 2 are awaiting publication, 4 are under review, 1 was recently submitted, and 1 Ph. D. dissertation was published. One Ph. D. student graduated and is currently employed by Qualcomm, one is continuing in his Ph. D. program, and one post-doctoral research associate has recently assumed a tenure-track faculty position at New Mexico State University.\n\nDigital transmission and storage systems employ binary digits - \"ones\" or \"zeroes\"  - or bits to represent information, and those bits are corrupted by noise and interference on the communication channel or defects in the storage medium that limit the system's ability to recover the information reliably.  To mitigate the effects of this corruption, engineers design so-called error-correcting codes that add redundancy to the information (at the transmitter) in such a way that (at the receiver) a decoder is able to recover the information, even if corruption occurred en route.\n\nBased on the pioneering work of Claude Shannon in 1948, it is known that there is a maximum data transmision speed (or data storage density) at which reliable communication is possible. Spatially coupled codes, the focus of this project, represent a new approach that allows error correction to be performed at this maximum rate.  In addition, the fact that the codes are represented by sparse graphs insures that the process can be accomplished with low implementation complexity.  In other words, the codes are well-suited to practical applications.\n\nA digital transmitter takes a stream of information bits and introduces redundancy through the appending of parity bits to form a coded message. These parity bits are generated in such a way that certain groups of bits in the coded message are guaranteed to contain an even number of \"ones\" - thus imposing a parity constraint on what constitutes a valid coded message. This process is call encoding.\n\nSignal processing (modulation, amplification, and filtering) is then applied to the coded message to generate a transmitted signal that is sent over a cable or wire (for a wireline system) or to the leads of a transmit antenna (for a wireless system).  After the transmitted signal traverses through a noisy medium, more signal processing is applied at the receiver - filtering, demodulation, and decoding.  Ideally, the net result is the recovery of the original information bits in uncorrupted form.\n\nLow-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, of which spatially coupled codes are a type, can be represented using a simple graphical model containing two types of nodes: variable nodes (representing the transmitted message bits) and check nodes (representing the parity constraints).  An \"edge\" connects a variable node to a check node if and only if the parity condition represented by the check node includes the variable node. An LDPC code is one in which each parity constraint involves only a few variable nodes, resulting in a sparse graph, which leads to low-complexity decoding.  A spatially coupled LDPC code is one that can be constructed by combining (or \"coupling\") multiple identical graphical structures in a way that yields a code that is both effective in terms of its error-correcting capability and efficient to implement.\n\nDecoding is the process through which the noisy-and-possibly-corrupted received signal is used to recover the original information.  This is accomplished by taking the noisy received data and processing it on the associated graph.  Because the graph describes all the constraints that the transmitted bits must satisfy, it can be used to iteratively improve the estimates of ..."
