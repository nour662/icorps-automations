The eye tracking system enables pursuing further work and greater quantitative analysis in design and usability research focused on issues such as the effect of the interface design of security-focused software on the secure behaviors and awareness of security features of the software users.\r\nCurrent work at the institution focuses on the particular application of these methods in an introductory programming course. The Information Technology Leadership (ITL) faculty have broaden their research to encompass more mobile computing that has contributed in developing a collaboration with Biology faculty. In turn, this collaboration has given rise to a mobile application used when collecting ecological data in the field. A beta version, now under assessment, has been created and deployed where the eye tracking methods will be used to confirm that mobile technologies enable not only more accurate data collection, but better learning and retention on the part of the student researchers in the field.\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis solely undergraduate institution core mission focuses on research involving significant undergraduate collaboration. In particular, the ITL Department is committed to enabling its majors to take part in significant research projects that allow them to act as true collaborators and not simply as coders or lab technicians. Thus, with an existing history of engaging undergraduates in design and usability research, a modern eye tracking system will strengthen the program making it accessible to more students. The system will play a role in classroom activities, labs, and independent projects. Students should gain fluency with the tool and with appropriate methods for using it in regular coursework. A service management course will be required for all seniors to partner with local non-profits to provide technical consulting or development. The system provides a platform for continued interdisciplinary research, including ongoing work in Biology and potential projects that involve Political Science, Gender and Women?s Studies, Sociology, and Psychology.",
