Its accumulation in lakes and sediments has lead to adverse biological effects in wildlife and to health threats to humans, prompting a need for large-scale monitoring and bioremediation efforts.  The mobility and bioavailability of Se in water strongly depends on the chemical form of Se.  This project will investigate mechanisms of mobilization of dissolved Se oxyanions (selenate and selenite) and their immobilization in natural and remediation systems under diverse biogeochemical settings using a novel isotopic technique.  Over the past decade, stable Se isotope studies from other researchers have provided valuable insights to Se biogeochemistry and environmental Se source identification.  However, stable oxygen isotopic studies of Se oxyanions, so far lacking, will provide a new approach to characterizing Se redox cycling and expand applicability of isotope fractionations to reactions previously not sensitive to Se isotope fractionation, such as oxygen atom addition via oxidation.  The objective of this project is to develop a stable oxygen isotopic approach and apply it to answer key knowledge gaps within aqueous selenium biogeochemistry.  Laboratory experiments will examine reaction pathways including: (1) describing how dissolved selenate and selenite form from the oxidation of parent minerals and enter waterways, (2) probing interfacial oxygen exchange mechanisms that occur during oxyanion sorption to environmental metal oxides, and (3) assembling oxygen isotope fractionation indicators specific to oxyanion immobilization pathways such as reduction and uptake reactions with minerals, bacteria, algae, and fungi.  Stable oxygen isotope values of oxyanions, water, oxides, and oxidants will be monitored during reactions using isotope ratio mass spectrometry.  The oxygen isotope tracing experiments will identify likely sources of oxygen incorporation and exchange during oxyanion formation and interaction with oxides, leading to a clearer conceptual model of Se pollutant dynamics.  Like Se isotopes, the measured oxygen isotope fractionation values are expected to be unique to different reduction pathways and therefore can be used to distinguish between chemical and microbial reactions responsible for dissolved Se processing.  \r\n\r\nThis project will expand the scientific knowledge of how selenium oxyanions form and transform in aquatic systems through reaction pathway tracing with isotope labeling.  A better understanding will be developed for the chemical and microbial controls on selenium mobilization and immobilization.  The results are expected to form the basis of improved field site monitoring and remediation efforts by using isotopic information that directly reveal field site reactions.  The stable oxygen isotope approach to evaluating mechanisms will have broad applicability to evaluating other inorganic oxyanion contaminants such as arsenic and chromium.  This project will provide research opportunities for one graduate student and several undergraduate students, high school students, and K-12 teachers within a multidisciplinary setting that investigates chemical, biological, and mineralogical agents interacting with metallic water contaminants.  In addition to engaging experiential learning through hands-on laboratory engagement, these K-12 participants will also develop educational materials, in the form of field trip demonstrations and curriculum modules, for the instruction of broad audiences about the principles of water contamination and treatment.",

Laboratory experiments were designed to explore how the oxyanions become dissolved into water through oxidation reactions (formation of SeO4) or become fixed into sediments through reduction (formation of Se metal) and sorption reactions (attachment of SeO4 to mineral surfaces).  Each selenium transformation reaction was characterized using a new isotopic methodology that identified stable oxygen isotope signatures useful for providing new insights to reaction mechanisms. \n\nFor oxidation reactions, environmentally-relevant oxidants were evaluated to determine how selenite oxidizes to selenate in nature, a reaction that so far has remained a mystery.

Oxygen isotope tracing revealed selenate inherits three oxygen atoms from selenite and acquires its fourth O directly from the oxidant.  This observation can help interpret how selenate acquires its oxygen isotope signature and therefore its formation pathway in nature.  \n\nSelenate reduction to elemental selenium is an important pathway to remove dissolved selenium from water resources.  Here, two known reduction processes, chemical reduction by iron-bearing minerals and biological reduction by selenium-respiring bacteria, were further characterized isotopically and found to produce distinct oxygen isotope fractionation values in selenate which can be used to support groundwater management efforts by identifying and confirming each reduction process in field settings.

These minerals represent natural iron and magnesium pyroaurite minerals that can participate in the attenuation of groundwater pollutants, and they also can be harnessed for water treatment unit operations as anion exchange materials.  The best performing pyroaurite mineral was determined to be pyroaurite intercalated with chloride ions which are easily exchanged for selenium oxyanions within minutes.  In contrast, the commonly occurring carbonate intercalated form was found to be unreactive and may not represent a reactive mineral in subsurface environments. \n\nThis project provided research opportunities for four graduate students and eight undergraduate students.  Students received training in diverse topics of environmental engineering including water chemistry, analytical chemistry, photochemistry, mineralogy, microbiology, and spectroscopy.  One masters thesis and one PhD dissertation in addition to two publications and four more planned publications are resulting from the research efforts.  Research methods and results were incorporated into educational learning modules within the PI?s graduate and undergraduate courses in environmental chemistry and environmental engineering unit operations The project results are expected to provide greater understanding to selenium biogeochemical cycling in the environment and fundamental information on how stable oxygen isotope signatures of selenate are acquired or altered.  This information should be helpful for using oxygen isotopes as tracers or identifiers of selenate transformation in aquatic environments.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip Larese-Casanova"
