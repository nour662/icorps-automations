The meeting will facilitate scientific exchange by connecting investigators supported through NSF's EEID program. Each investigator will present new discoveries and receive feedback from peers. The conference will provide a venue for scientific exchange and discussion on research questions and challenges of relevance to the EEID grant program. The meeting will enhance the quality of research supported by NSF's EEID program, by promoting networking and peer review among funded investigators. It will foster productive new research collaborations among scientists in related areas of study, integrate young investigators into a research community and enrich their training, and accelerate the pace of learning, by exposing researchers to others' work.",
