 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop at the University of California San Diego brings together an international group of scholars from several social science disciplines, representatives of institutional review boards, and professionals from the research support and publication communities to address ethical issues emerging in the design and implementation of experimental research. The workshop focuses on identifying the central ethical issues, establishing clear guidelines, and working toward a consensus in the field to protect the integrity of research. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project is associated with its attention to a growing approach to scientific inquiry across the social sciences. Scholars have increasingly employed field, laboratory, and survey experiments both inside and outside the United States to evaluate a range of theoretically-driven questions. While obtaining clearance from US-based IRBs is a regular requirement, standards do not exist for obtaining similar approvals from the countries hosting the research activities. The workshop will address the ethical, intellectual, and scholarly issues in conducting experimental work outside the United States.\r\n\r\nThe workshop's broader impacts are connected with its goal of developing recommendations for researchers across the social sciences. The workshop will involve a range of experts who will publish the findings and recommendations, making them available to the scholarly community, professional associations, and the public.",
