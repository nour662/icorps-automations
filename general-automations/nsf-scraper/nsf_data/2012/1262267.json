 "awd_abstract_narration": "On September 5th, 2012, a moment magnitude (MW) 7.6 earthquake occurred along the\r\nlocked segment of the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica. This event ruptured in, or immediately\r\nbelow a region that previously ruptured in similarly sized earthquakes in 1853, 1900, and 1950.\r\nBecause of the known repeat risk, and the near-ideal local geometry, Nicoya has been the site of numerous studies to evaluate the subduction megathrust interface. Most recently, two projects were funded which allowed for the deployment of seismometers and continuous GPS instruments, and a more extensive GPS campaign to image the interseismic coupling and associated microseismicity.\r\n\r\nGiven the recent event, this RAPID grant is designed to expand the scope of this research\r\nfrom detailed imaging of a mature and mostly locked subduction megathrust, to characterizing\r\nearthquake rupture and early afterslip processes, including aftershocks. Because land is directly\r\nover the rupture zone, unlike most every other subduction environment, this new data will give\r\nunprecedented images of the extent and magnitude of seismic and postseismic failure. This data will be compared with published models of locking to evaluate whether geodetic methods can adequately forecast regions that will fail in large earthquakes. It will require detailed on-theground efforts to image the true extent of failure, and to determine whether the upper locked patch is still present, and primed for failure. The project will allow for the capture of critical and time-sensitive ground deformation and early aftershock seismicity that will be necessary to characterize the spatial extent and magnitude of earthquake rupture along the shallow subduction interface. The data, along with pre-event data recorded by our networks there will become a first-of-its-kind dataset for evaluating the transition from a mature and locked subduction interface, to a large earthquake, and early recovery as the seismic cycle begins anew.\r\n\r\nUsing RAPID funds, the researchers will capture coseismic and early post-earthquake ground\r\ndeformation and aftershock occurrence. Because these data are highly ephemeral, rapid action is necessary. The large displacements that occur during the earthquake, up to ~1 meter in this case, can change dramatically in the days/weeks/months that follow as poroelastic rocks relax, and momentum-driven mantle continues to drive more slip along the fault. Across the Nicoya\r\nPeninsula, we plan to: perform field repairs and collect data from about 20 continuous GPS and\r\nseismometers that may have been damaged in the earthquake; perform a GPS campaign of an\r\napproximate 30-site survey network; and deploy a semi-continuous network of GPS stations to\r\ncapture post-seismic deformation across the rupture area.\r\n\r\nThe research will fund fieldwork for five student and postdoctoral researchers. The experience will improve their scientific understanding of field-based geophysical research, and give first-hand experience of the impact a large earthquake can have on people and the land. The scientific results from this project will be directly beneficial to society, as it will give some\r\nof the first detailed images of coseismic rupture in comparison to previously imaged locked\r\nzones. This information is invaluable for assessing the potential to map faults that are likely to\r\nfail in future earthquakes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Nicoya Earthquake After-event Response (NEAR) Project allowed for an international team of investigators to perform much needed geophysical observations in the days and weeks following a major subduction zone earthquake (the type that includes the world\u00c6s largest earthquakes) that occurred on Sept. 5, 2012.  This study was unique in that, because of the beneficial location of regional coastline, we were able to make almost direct land-based observations of the ground deformation and seismic activity associated with this earthquake.  The project allowed for the repair and data collection from seismometers and continuous GPS stations that were already in place at the time of the earthquake, a detailed GPS campaign to identify ground motion along a dense network of survey points across the region, as well as a study of coastal changes associated with deformation from the earthquake. \n \n\n\nIn analyzing the data collected through this experiment we found that the 2012 Nicoya Earthquake ruptured an area that was previously identified as strongly locked and storing elastic strain energy for release in a major earthquake.  The prior work, which was published just 2 months before the earthquake, identified that the area was capable of producing an earthquake of up to magnitude 7.8, a little larger than the magnitude 7.6 that was observed in this earthquake.   This result presents the first paired observation of both the details of pre-earthquake locking and then rapid release of that patch during a major earthquake along the megathrust region.  Using the seismic data, continuous and semi-continuous GPS we continued to observe the ongoing deformation and slip along the megathrust during the weeks to months following this earthquake.  This deformation identifies how the fault is evolving as stress changes caused by the earthquake cause continued slip around the earthquake rupture area, and how the mantle deforms in an effort to equilibrate the stresses across the region.\n\n \n\nThis research highlights the use current geophysical information about the loading of faults for identifying future earthquake potential.  Such information obtained along other major subduction (and other) faults can herald in a new era in seismic, and possibly tsunami hazard analysis. Because this work highlights the utility of preseismic deformation for informed assessment of future earthquakes, it provides a major stepping-stone to improve seismic and tsunami hazard assessments that can be used for more informed education and hazard mitigation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew V Newman"
