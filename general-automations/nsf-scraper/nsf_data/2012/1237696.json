The primary focus of this workshop is to develop a curriculum framework for addressing the ethical issues associated with geocoded data. The workshop is identifying current and novel methods for teaching information ethics and assembling relevant resources from an array of disciplines that could have relevant applications. The goal of this workshop is to create a broad curriculum for legal, social, and ethical implications for creators and users of geocoded data, to identify foundational literature upon which the curriculum would be built, and to create and/or identify relevant instructional tools and teaching resources that would be incorporated into the curriculum.",
