 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to apply techniques from quantum chemistry to predict the catalyzed chemical wear rate of tools used in single point diamond turning of alloys with varying composition, and then to validate those predictions. Current theory successfully predicts diamond wear rates for elemental metals, based on atomic electronic structures, but the predictions do not apply to alloys.  A metric for predicting diamond wear when cutting alloys will be generated based on the electronic structure of alloys, using a method with linear combinations of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals in metals and alloys. Wear rates for a range of alloys will be determined using a novel interferometric technique and compared with the new metric. Chemical reaction rates depend on local temperature, which depends on material properties and tool edge condition (wear).  Cutting temperatures will be measured using a novel pyrometric method and cutting forces will be measured using a dynamometer. These data will be used to normalize wear rates.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this work will provide a method of selecting optimum alloy compositions for such rapidly emerging technologies as roll-to-roll production of complex films or next generation optical molds for high volume optoelectronic products. The currently expensive, and time consuming, testing of tool wear for every alloy composition will be eliminated. In addition, the results will stimulate new thinking across diverse parts of the research community. The proposed experimental techniques will be useful in other areas of precision machining research.  The transformative change in thinking about catalytic activity in alloys may impact areas ranging from diamond synthesis to coal gasification. It also suggests developing alloys with properties optimized for structural as well as catalytic behaviors.",
