  "por_txt_cntn": "MRI: Acquisition of an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) System for Elemental Analysis and Speciation,\n\n Project Outcomes Report\n\nThis project involved purchase of an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) system for trace element and speciation analysis.  The ICP-MS system is coupled with a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and advanced detectors to provide state-of-the-art detection of trace elements, chemical speciation of elements with multiple oxidation states, and advanced methods for measuring selected organic compounds.  This analytical system has provided support and expanded existing research and teaching in the following areas:\n\n            Energy-Water-Environment research: The arid southwest is a major energy producing region and there is a direct link between energy sources and water resources.  Research on environmental and water impacts of energy development require rapid, sensitive and innovative analyses of solid and aqueous samples.\n\n            Energy production: UNM is leading a large collaborative program to develop electrocatalysts for production of hydrogen gas and oxidation of ethanol in fuel cells.  Trace level analysis and speciation will enable better characterization and understanding of the role of trace elements in catalysis. \n\n            Environmental engineering: Current research on selective removal of trace contaminants such asarsenic, selenium, and uranium from water will benefit from rapid, quantitative speciation of of these elements by HPLC-ICP-MS.  Speciation of these metals is critical to this research.\n\n \n\n            Biogeochemistry:  Biogenetic mineral deposits in extreme environments require precision trace element characterization for which ICP-MS will be a significant improvement over ICP-OES.  Supporting microbial culture studies will take advantage of the CryoCell and small-spot capabilities.\n\n            Biological function and toxicology:  UNM has a major research program on the biological function of As and other trace metals focused on their toxicology and interactions with other elements (Zn).  This work will take advantage of high sensitivity for trace level experiments, CryoCell capability for tissue analysis and speciation measurements.\n\nThe University of New Mexico contributed to the project by funding renovation of the Geoenvironmental Analytical Laboratory\u00c6s (GAL) labs.  This renovation included extensive upgrades to the laboratory\u00c6s electrical power system, its HVAC system, and the laboratory\u00c6s exhaust system.  Old lab benches were replaced with new equipment and the room was painted.  This renovation constituted part of the required match for the NSF grant in the form of in-kind support.\n\nThe major components of the new analytical system consist of:\n\nA Perkin-Elmer Nexion 300D inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) system was acquired and installed.  The system has been fully operational since June, 2013.\n\n\nA Perkin-Elmer Flexar High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system to achieve elemental speciation prior to ICP-MS analysis was acquired and installed.\n\n\nThe ICP-MS system has been interfaced with an existing New Wave WP 213 laser ablation system to permit spot analyses of solid samples.\n\n\nA GeoMed cryocell sample preparation system was acquired and installed.  This system, together with the laser ablation system, permits spot analyses of biological samples.\n\n\nA Dionex/Thermo Fisher Scientific Electro Coulo Chem detector to allow detection of non-volatile organic compounds by HPLC was acquired and installed. \n\n\nThe instrumentation is being used at least 20 hours per week both for routine analyses and to develop new analytical techniques to meet the needs of researchers at UNM and its sister universities.  The HPLC-ICP-MS system has found extensive use to support teaching activities in undergraduate and graduate classes, non-sponsored graduate student research projects, and sponsored research p..."
