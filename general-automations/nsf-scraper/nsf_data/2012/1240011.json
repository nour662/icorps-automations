 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase II project is supporting a total of 75 Noyce scholars to become science and mathematics teachers. Boise State University is partnering with the Caldwell, Vallivue, Nampa, Joint No.2 School Districts and the Independent School District of Boise City. The project is providing summer internships to spark STEM undergraduate majors interest in STEM teaching as a career, providing scholarships for students completing their teacher preparation curriculum, and sustaining ongoing professional development to assure Noyce alumni success. Noyce alumni are being provided with opportunities to attend professional conferences, tuition assistance for continuing education, peer mentoring, and access to communities of practice. These project activities are accompanied by a rigorous plan of research that looks at factors that influence the multiple stages of STEM teacher education. Building on the Noyce I results with mathematics education, this project is also exploring the influence that Co-PIs from chemistry and engineering have on the number of physical science education majors graduating from Boise State. \r\n\r\nThe project is providing a model for holistically approaching the multiple stages of teacher preparation and development. The research and instrument development are expected to provide both a framework and the tools necessary to investigate the effectiveness of similar programs.",

When students hear about this opportunity, they are intrigued to learn more about our program, and several have indicated it was the reason they decided to pursue a STEM teaching certificate. Another outcome of the Noyce Scholarship Program has been that our scholars are able to focus on coursework rather than worrying about money and working too many hours (which over influences their ability to complete their degree). The average GPA of our Noyce Scholar graduates over the course of the grant was a 3.5. Finally, and most importantly, the Noyce Scholarship Program has helped to increase the number of STEM teachers in our area. Becoming a Noyce Scholar requires a commitment to teach since they are obligated to teach for one year for every $5000 they receive. Throughout the life of the grant, the grant resulted in 22 new STEM teachers, with 15 more teachers scheduled to graduate within the next 2 years.
