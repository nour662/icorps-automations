 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) that will support ten undergraduate Fellows (rising seniors) annually for a 10-12 week summer internship program.  Individual student research projects and the associated one-on-one mentorship with one or more members of the WHOI scientific and senior technical staff are the heart of the WHOI REU program. Another component of the program is the summer lecture series, which is designed for the Fellows and attended by all of them. The talks provide an introduction to the wide range of current research at WHOI, and an appreciation of how individual research efforts and interdisciplinary projects can advance our understanding of the oceans. The program also includes a half-day Ethics in Science workshop, and the opportunity to take part in the full range of academic and social activities available during the summer in Woods Hole. Finally, WHOI provides an at-sea experience for all Fellows on WHOI's coastal research vessel, R.V. Tioga.  At the end of the summer, each Fellow prepares a written report describing their research, and makes a public oral presentation of their research results. \r\n\r\nSupport provided by NSF includes funding for student stipends, student travel to and from the site, student housing and meals and some administrative costs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) Summer Student Fellowship program is one of the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) sites supported by the National Science Foundation?s (NSF) Division of Ocean Sciences.  Funds provided by this 5-year project supported undergraduate students participating in WHOI's Summer Student Fellowship program - 10 Fellows each year in 2012, 2013, 2016 and 12 Fellows in 2014 and 2015 (the latter using supplemental funds for an additional 2 Fellows in each year.  The Fellows spent 10-12 weeks during the summer to work on research projects hosted by the laboratories of WHOI scientists.  Under the guidance of a WHOI scientist, each Fellow designed and implemented a research project.  At the end of the summer, Fellows presented their results orally or in a poster session to WHOI scientists and other Fellows, and in a written report submitted to their scientific host.  Many of the reports led to presentations at scientific meetings or to scientific publications.  The strong research focus of our program provided undergraduate Fellows with an opportunity to engage in the process of scholarly research, including formulating the research plan based on the scientific method, executing the research, assessing the results and presenting oral and written reports.  Many studies have shown that the research on real scientific problems is an effective way to stimulate and sustain interest in science and technology.\n\n One of the trends during the 5-year period of this award was the increase in both applications and resident Fellows from minorities underrepresented in the ocean sciences,  particularly Hispanic students.  In 2007 the program included no underrepresented minority students, whereas over the last 5 years (2012-2016) members of minority groups comprised 30-60% of NSF-funded Fellows.  Women comprised 57% of the 54 Fellows.\n\nWe were able to locate 96% of the 54 NSF-funded Fellows in our program from 2011-2015.  In addition, 10 Fellows participated in our summer, 2016 program and returned to their home institution for their senior year.\n\nOf the 54 who were an NSF-funded SSF participant from 2011-2015:\n\n&bull;           1 is still an undergraduate choosing an option for a 5th year before graduating.\n\n&bull;           34 are working on a higher degree:\n\n                        22 are enrolled in an MS or Ph.D. ocean science graduate program;\n\n                        8 are enrolled in other science/engineering graduate programs;\n\n                        4 are enrolled in non-science graduate programs (e.g. law school).\n\n&bull;           5 are in a so-called \"gap\" year with the intent of enrolling in a graduate program in fall, 2017 (2 of those were awarded Fulbright Scholarships for study abroad).\n\n&bull;           10 are currently employed in a scientific or technical field.\n\n&bull;           2 are employed in a non-scientific or technical field.\n\nBased on these statistics, we believe we achieved our goal for our program's outcome - training future leaders in ocean science and other technical/scientific fields.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/08/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James A Yoder"
