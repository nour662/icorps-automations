First,\r\nthe principal investigator's PhD thesis laid the foundations of a\r\nnovel approach to functoriality for Floer homology, and the next\r\nsteps in this direction are to remove some restrictive hypotheses\r\nand to confirm the compatibility of this theory with the\r\npair-of-pants product on Floer homology.  Second, Frauenfelder\r\nand the PI have recent established Floer homology for negative\r\nline bundles, that is, for a class of non-compactly supported\r\nHamiltonian functions in non-compact symplectic manifolds, and\r\nthis theory should be made more robust by removing symplectic\r\nasphericity hypotheses and should also be extended to a\r\nMorse-Bott situation.  Third, the PI will apply the Fredholm\r\ntheory in polyfolds developed by Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder to\r\nexplore newly emerging invariants from the theory of polyfolds\r\nwith operations.\r\n\r\nSymplectic geometry is the study of spaces equipped with the\r\nbasic structure that underlies Hamiltonian mechanics, for which\r\npreferred coordinates give both position and momentum of a moving\r\nobject and in which conservation of energy is natural and\r\ninevitable.  The Floer homology theory referred to in the first\r\nparagraph studies such manifolds through the critical point\r\nbehaviors of certain auxiliary spaces; this kind of analysis of\r\ncritical points goes back to work of Marston Morse circa the\r\n1930s, but its application in the modern context requires new\r\ntools such as the polyfold theory cited above.\r\n",
