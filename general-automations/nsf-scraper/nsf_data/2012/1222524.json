 "awd_abstract_narration": "This broader implementation project will create a professional network of individuals and institutions increasing their capacity to develop, implement, and evaluate the impact of large scale community science festivals.  The project builds on a previous award that supported the implementation of science festivals in Cambridge, MA; San Francisco, San Diego, and Philadelphia.  Each festival reached 50-70,000 attendees, many of them families from low-income, ethnic communities.  Festival organizers and participants include science center practitioners, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) researchers, STEM related businesses, public television STEM producers, universities, K-12 schools, and government and foundation stakeholders.  The summative evaluation indicated significant impacts on participant's STEM interest, learning, and connections to STEM resources in their community.  The number of science festivals across the country is increasing.  Consequently this new project will create a professional network with numerous benefits to professionals in the Informal Science Education (ISE) field and other stakeholders including:  timely access to information, knowledge and experience related to science festivals; rich relationships to draw on when facing challenges; credibility of the festival concept; ability to partner with multiple festivals and magnify the reach of existing ISE institutions and program; diffusion of knowledge and innovation; and collective intelligence and inclusive consultation.  It is expected that the network will involve supporting approximately 50 science festivals during the grant period.  A business plan will be developed for long term sustainability of the network and the subsequent growth of science festivals.  This is a collaborative proposal with 4 project partners who have distinct roles in creating and sustaining the network: MIT, University of California at San Francisco, University of North Carolina/Morehead Planetarium and Science Center, and The Franklin Institute.\r\n\r\nMIT's project deliverables include hosting the central management and administrative functions of the network and providing conferences, workshops, individual mentoring of new science festival champions, maintaining the network website, etc.  UCSF will develop tools, resources, and linkages to increase participation of scientists in festivals.  UNC/Morehead Planetarium and Science Center will provide expertise in statewide festival organizing. The Franklin Institute will help network participants build capacity for engaging low-income families with programming examples, community asset analysis tools, and webinars.  \r\n\r\nThis multi-hub approach is a new innovative strategy for creating and sustaining the first ever professional network for science festival organizers.\r\n\r\nThe project evaluation will focus on the network's vibrancy, connectivity and effect.  Network vibrancy impact data will be collected on how members share goals, enhance leadership, and expand geographic and model diversity.  Network connectivity evaluation will study the strength and growth of the relationships within the SFA network.  Network effects will study the ways the Science Festival Alliance (SFA) network is achieving science festival organizational capacity looking at increases in the number of science festivals, geographic spread, science festival innovations, and the presence of a SFA sustainability plan.\r\n\r\nThis project will add new knowledge about the impact of networks on the development and impact of science festivals throughout the country.",
