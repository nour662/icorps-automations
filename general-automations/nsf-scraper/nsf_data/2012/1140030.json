 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award under the University Radio Observatories (URO) program supports scientific research, technical developments, operations, student training and public outreach at the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO). The ARO operates the 10 m Sub-millimeter Telescope (SMT) on Mt. Graham and the 12 m millimeter-wave antenna at Kitt Peak. The ARO facility offers wide frequency coverage from 65 to 720 GHz utilizing state-of-the-art ALMA-type heterodyne sideband-separating (SBS) receivers. This provides the high sensitivity and stability needed for spectroscopy with broad intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidths (16 GHz) to do large Galactic and extragalactic surveys in the spatial and frequency domains supported by this instrumentation. Further, the ARO capabilities allow for a wide range of observations requiring maximum sensitivity, such as Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). The single-dish programs serve as both ALMA preparatory and ALMA complementary science investigations. The ARO complements spectroscopic studies across the ALMA frequency range and provides a venue for path-finding observations for the ALMA array. The investigators plan to develop and construct receivers and a new digital spectrometer will be fabricated for maximum utilization of the receivers. \r\n \r\nThe support from the URO program permits that 50% of the time on both ARO telescopes will be available to outside observers. The ARO supports users with trained telescope operators, on-site visitor facilities, and remote observing capabilities. The telescopes are closely connected to laboratory spectroscopy facilities, which allows the measurement and astronomical verification of crucial molecular data.\r\n\r\nThe research by the investigators addresses the processes whereby stars and planetary systems are created from interstellar material and the feedback effects on the dynamical and chemical state of the interstellar medium (ISM). Studies include: \r\n(a) an extensive survey of starless cores and Class 0 protostars (b) large scale mapping in CO and other molecules to probe star formation in Bok globules and giant molecular clouds, (c) a broad molecular line survey of the circumstellar shell of NML Cygnus to document the dynamical and chemical properties of massive supergiant stars; (d) exploration of the morphology and chemical composition of planetary nebulae to better understand their connection to the diffuse ISM and the formation of dense clouds; (e) molecular line studies of refractory gas-phase molecules to elucidate dust grain composition; and (f) documentation of the properties of sub-mm galaxies through surveys of transitions of species such as H2O and CI that offer great diagnostic power. In addition, ARO will continue to play a key role in the international millimeter/sub-millimeter VLBI studies of the environs of black holes (e.g. Sgr A*). \r\n\r\nAmong the broader impacts of the ARO program are undergraduate and graduate student training opportunities in multi -disciplinary science involving observations, instrumentation development and laboratory research. This program will strengthen student engagement and STEM education and to diversify the population of students and researchers in STEM fields.",

The ARO operates the 10 m Sub-millimeter Telescope (SMT) on Mt. Graham and the 12 m millimeter-wave antenna at Kitt Peak. During the grant period the ARO, under the leadership of the PI Dr. Lucy M.

The ARO scientific agenda has focused on investigation of the differing forms of molecular material in the many objects that compose the interstellar medium. &nbsp;Molecules created in old, dying stars were studied by PI Ziurys and graduate student Edwards, in&nbsp; particular those in very massive stars, called supergiants. &nbsp;A &ldquo;spectral survey&rdquo; of the supergiant star NML Cyg was carried out at the SMT across the 1 mm wavelength band. A chemical &ldquo;picture&rdquo; of the star was created from these data, as shown in Image 4. The middle panel shows signals from molecules in NML Cyg in the frequency range 215 &ndash; 285 GHz, or from 1.4 to 1.05 mm, which appear as sharp spikes. The lower panel shows an enlargement of small region of the frequency spectrum near 282 GHz. Here the molecular signals are identified as arising from such unusual species as sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and phosphorus nitride (PN). Many other &ldquo;non-terrestrial&rdquo; chemical compounds were found in these data in NML Cyg.&nbsp; Remarkably, the chemical content of NML Cyg is very similar to that of another supergiant star, VY CMa, whose molecular signals are shown over the identical frequency region in Image 4, upper panel. Ziurys and students Zack, Edwards, and Schmidt also continued their studies of the molecular content of stars that have basically &ldquo;died&rdquo; &ndash; so-called planetary nebulae (PNe). At this stage, the star has evolved into a white dwarf and has lots most of its initial mass, which forms a bright nebula around the fading star. Because white dwarfs emit copious amounts of ultraviolet radiation, it is through that all molecules located around the star would be destroyed. A series of observations by Ziurys and students have shown the opposite &ndash; PNe contain large amounts of molecular material, including significant amounts of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), the ethynyl radical (CCH), a possible building block for buckyballs, and a charged species, HCO<sup>+</sup>. These molecules appear to exist throughout the nebulae, as shown in Image 5. Here the Helix Nebula is shown, as seen by the eye; superimposed over this is how the nebula appears in molecules, as traced by HCO<sup>+</sup>. In addition, Co-I Shirley and graduate students discovered over 1000 dense regions in clouds in our Galaxy that are likely to become stars, and examined their chemical content. Co-I Bieging made large images of the carbon monoxide molecule in the Galaxy, revealing a picture of the molecular content of the Galaxy as a whole. The ARO also participated in imaging black holes in the center of galaxies, along with other telescope across the globe. From the technical aspect, a new detector, called a &ldquo;receiver,&rdquo; was developed for the SMT to operate in the 0.8 mm range.
