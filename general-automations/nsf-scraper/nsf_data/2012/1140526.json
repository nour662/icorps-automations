 "awd_abstract_narration": "Curricular changes link three distinct scientific disciplines (chemical biology, biochemistry, and neurobiology) through the introduction of a series of three thematically-connected, research-based laboratories. In these discipline courses, students synthesize novel biological imaging agents (chemical biology), using these same imaging agents to catalogue the substrate specificity of ester hydrolases from  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) (biochemistry), and combine the products to screen for new components of neural signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans (neurobiology). The introduction of open-ended, hypothesis-driven research design into three biomolecular science laboratories increases student exposure to the practice of scientific research. Students practice the skills necessary to be working scientists, including formulating hypotheses, designing experimental plans, solving problems, and communicating results both orally and in writing. In addition, students organize a symposium at a regional undergraduate research conference. Students in these courses are challenged to integrate multiple scientific disciplines and a diverse set of laboratory skills within the context of larger scientific investigations (TB infection and neuronal communication). Student participation in projects allows them to contribute new knowledge and research tools to the understanding of the biochemistry of TB infection and neuronal communication. Overall, the three linked courses introduce students to interdisciplinary science, allowing students to participate in current areas of research.",
