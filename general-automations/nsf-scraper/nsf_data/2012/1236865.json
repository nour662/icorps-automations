Of particular interest, and currently deeply lacking in information/data, is the role of atmospheric processes (e.g. oxidizing reaction scenarios) to significantly alter a wide breadth of fullerene environmental behavior(s) including: solubility, (bio)availability, reactivity, stability, toxicity and overall environmental impact. This project is designed to fundamentally evaluate the reactivity (including kinetic and derivative analyses) of solid state and aqueous available fullerene species under various, highly controlled, atmospheric conditions, focused on oxidation pathways. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that C60, as a model fullerene, can be chemically oxidized and physically altered by a variety of oxidative, yet ubiquitous, processes in the atmosphere. Sub-hypotheses include: (A) Multiple, competing oxidative reactions occur simultaneously, albeit with different kinetics, resulting in corresponding and various derivatives; (B) Under \"wet\" conditions (>10% RH), fullerenes will become increasingly hydrophilic, dissolving aggregates, with hydrolysis as major reaction after initial oxidation; (C) Model (atmospheric) organics and inorganics in the gas phase will modify these kinetics; (D) Reaction products from \"wet\" reactions (>10% RH) will be relatively stable in aqueous systems; whereas\r\nunder \"dry\" reaction conditions, derivatives will continue to react with water upon aqueous exposure.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: At the conclusion of this project, we will have a vastly improved understanding of environmentally relevant chemical mechanisms/pathways and physico-chemical factors that control the rate and extent of fullerene aggregation, transformation(s) and stabilities under atmospheric conditions. This information will provide fundamental understanding for material life cycle(s) in addition to aiding in the interpretation of fullerene toxicological studies. Results will also provide information regarding fullerene stability, storage and commercial applications, and will contribute to the development of green fullerene chemistries.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: In addition to creating and disseminating new technical knowledge needed for decision-making regarding an industrially produced, engineered nanomaterial; this project (platform) is designed to broadly impact both undergraduate and graduate education and research, in addition to contributing to specific K-12 outreach programs. Graduate and undergraduate\r\n(project integrated) education and highly interdisciplinary research will strengthen our human resource base in an emerging need area where qualified researchers are in short supply, yet needed for the development of sustainable nanotechnologies. Furthermore, PI's will support and work directly with educators and students, providing expertise and regular mentoring at the St. Louis' Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP): Inspire Academy, preparing students for local, regional and international science fair projects and competitions.",

The key outcomes (intellectual merit) of this work clearly demonstrates that aerosolized nC60 nanoparticles (as 100 nm aggregates) do in fact react, under ambient atmospheric conditions, to a significant degree, becoming more oxidized.  This finding supports our overarching project hypothesis.  Reactions were observed to be limited to the surface oxidation and surface oxidation extent was correlated with hydroxyl radical exposure (under photo-irradiation).  Such oxidation (making the particles more hydrophilic) will alter the behavior of nC60 / C60 at the air-water interface and thus change the physical transport and fate of these materials in a natural system(s).   Through this project, the potential aerosol mass (PAM) reaction chamber was further characterized and tested for use as a heterogeneous oxidation chamber, broadening the application of this tool for future atmospheric studies of these and other nanomaterials.  Broader impacts of this project were focused on an integrated educational outreach program included undergraduate and graduate level education and research experience as well as general STEM development at local high school (working with STEM teachers) and 6-8 grade under represented minority students at the WUSTL sponsored KIPP Academy charter school, focused on Science Olympiad and Science Fair activities. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John D Fortner"
