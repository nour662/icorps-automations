The host scientist is Wang Chengshan.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to use the geochemistry of volcanic rocks erupted during the collision of India with Asia to better understand deep earth processes during continental collisions.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
