 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to experimentally study, via nanomechanical tests, the effect of internal geometry on the mechanical properties of nanoporous metal foams. The ultimate goal is to provide understanding of the extent to which the mechanical properties can be enhanced via intelligent material design of nanoporous foams.  Nanoporous metal foams consist of an interconnected network of nanosized struts and show great promise in a variety of applications including batteries, fuel cells, sensors, etc. due to their large surface to volume ratios.  Due to their unique synthesis technique by dealloying that results in distinct geometrical structure with nanosized features, nanoporous metal foam properties cannot be simply inferred from the properties of bulk metal foams or other nanostructured materials. Successful completion of the proposed research will establish a deeper understanding of the structure-property relation of these novel materials.  \r\n\r\nThe majority of the experimental work will be performed by graduate students who will gain invaluable experience in nanotechnology research.  Through Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program the PI will attract undergraduate students to work on parts of this project.  The PI will also work with local high-school teachers through the Georgia Intern-Fellowships for Teachers Program (GIFT) to introduce results from the proposed work into demos/experiments that introduce nanotechnology and energy concepts to pre-college students.",
