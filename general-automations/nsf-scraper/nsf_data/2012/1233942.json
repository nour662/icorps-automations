 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit: Recent decades have seen profound changes in higher latitude climate. This project addresses two goals responding to these changes. The first goal is to develop improved understanding of what past oceanic changes have occurred at high latitude during the past century through application of data assimilation to the sparse historical record of meteorological and oceanic measurements. The first task associated with this goal will be to improve the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) data assimilation ocean reanalysis as a tool for high latitude research. This task builds directly on work funded by the predecessor to this grant. This special high latitude effort is required because of the complexities of the region's topography, water masses and currents, the sparse, inhomogeneous oceanic and meteorological observational network, and the important role of sea ice and haline processes. The second task will be to explore the limits the historical data sampling and surface meteorology place on what can be learned about past climate variability through experiments testing the credibility of long ocean reanalyses.\r\n\r\nThe second goal is to examine these results to explore the processes governing interaction between the high latitude ocean, the lower latitude ocean, and the overlying atmosphere, and how these interactions may contribute to climate variability. The remarkable warming the Nordic Seas and Arctic has experienced in the last decade bears similarity to a warm period in the 1920s-1930s. How similar are these two periods, both in magnitude and in impact on the subpolar North Atlantic and on the overlying atmosphere? On shorter decadal timescales the Atlantic Water flowing into the Nordic Seas shows substantial variability partially related to large-scale patterns in meteorology. Related to this are the anomalies of surface salinity such as the Great Salinity Anomaly. What is the origin of this variability, its relationship to the atmosphere, and what is its climate significance? Addressing this second goal will require exploring these mechanisms in coupled atmosphere/ocean/ice models, and in particular the new IPCC-class model runs, using the results of the assimilation studies as guidance. Coupled climate models have complete physics that allow the tracking of the movement of properties such as freshwater and heat through the climate system, while the comparisons to SODA and the historical observations provides information about the realism of the models.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This project will provide the scientific community with an improved analysis of past changes in the upper ocean temperature, salinity, and circulation at high latitude through development and dissemination of an improved SODA ocean reanalysis and improved understanding of its uncertainties. The project?s involvement in the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project and other venues will help promote the greater knowledge and use of ocean reanalyses generally, and SODA in particular. The second part of this research project, improving understanding of the role of oceanic basin exchanges is a process that needs to be understood in order to develop predictive models. The project will have a substantial educational component by making the data sets, analyses, and computer resources developed as part of this work freely available to the graduate students in the department.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhat role does the ocean play in the variability and changing climate of the Arctic?  That is a key motivating question for this collaborative research project. \n\nThe Arctic system derives much of its heat from the eight million tons per second inflow of warm water from the Atlantic, which is carrying heat that we believe must play a role in the gradual loss of Arctic sea ice.  Beginning in the late-1990s and lasting for a decade observations in the Nordic Seas show that this inflowing Atlantic Water warmed by an additional 1&deg;F, but we know little about the climate consequences of this warming.  The first task of this project took a step forward in understanding by reconstructing the three dimensional changes in the ocean-sea ice system (for example, the currents, temperature, salinity, sea ice thickness) over a 35 year period.  The reconstruction was made by using estimation theory to combine direct observations of ocean properties with computer model simulations of the dynamics of the ocean and interactive sea ice.  Incidentally, we distribute the latest version of those results as a series of 5 day and monthly averaged data sets of temperature, salinity, velocity, and other properties through the website  www.soda.umd.edu.\n\nThe second task was to examine this historical record to document the changes in ocean variability during those 35 years.  This documentation includes papers published in 2011 and 2012 exploring the history and fate of ten warm/salty and cold/fresh surges of water flowing into the Arctic, of which it turns out the late-1990s warm event was by far the largest (see figure). \n\nDuring the course of this project an advanced graduate student, Yanni Ding, joined us and was supported by this research grant.  The first part of Yanni?s dissertation examined the seasonal circulation of the Arctic as it appears in our data sets.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change oversaw many CMIP5 multi-decade long coupled climate simulations that were also made available to Yanni.  The second part her dissertation explored these CMIP5 simulations.  In just one aspect of this model diagnostic work Yanni examined the ocean response to tropical volcanic eruptions.  The biggest tropical eruptions, such as the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, are able to inject aerosols into the stratosphere where they may persist for several years, scattering incoming sunlight and thus causing cooling of the surface ocean.   Yanni was able to analyze thousands of years of these climate model simulations to extract a robust ocean response to these tropical eruptions, addressing such questions as whether sea ice grows in response to these volcanoes, their impact on El Nino, and how they affect the ocean?s overturning circulation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/27/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James A Carton"
