 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advancements in mathematical models, numerical algorithms and computing capabilities have brought many complex non-linear problems in science and engineering closer to understanding through simulations. The increased resolution and modeling fidelity comes with an increase in the complexity of developing and managing advanced simulations software.  A key factor in effective utilization of HPC resources for simulation is the availability of sophisticated, scalable, and robust community codes. Because of their complexity, the development of such codes demands interdisciplinary, long-term collaborative efforts by teams of experts. \r\n\r\nThis award will fund a workshop to develop ideas on how to widen the user base on the high-end HPC platforms through the use of community codes and an integrated computing approach to science. Such a workshop on community codes is timely in view of the extraordinary challenges faced by computational scientists in planning and preparing for the next generation computing platforms. The workshop will address topics including;   understanding what it takes to develop successful community codes; practical and effective software engineering for scientific codes;  interdisciplinary interactions in integrated science computing; and data management and analysis for scientific simulations.",
