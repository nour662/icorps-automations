 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop technologies for a sustainable, fully-automated Smart Transit System (STS) which will operate in grid connected and transit mode on fixed pathways. It will develop advanced modeling and simulation to identify optimization and control requirements for smart transit system integration with the grid, including scheduling and routing methods required for joint management of the grid and transit aspects of the integrated system. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project will develop the kinds of tools which will be needed to upgrade electric power distribution systems in general, in order to accommodate more electric transportation. Basic challenges include when and how to charge (drawing from grid), ancillary and intermittency mitigation (giving back to grid),  jointly optimizing routing and charging strategies, power quality solutions and integration of electric vehicle with renewable sources. \r\nThe project will develop a simulation platform for interfacing with multiple stakeholders on current issues. The sustainable automated transport system can provide stability to grid by providing ancillary services during contingencies and voltage support after a fault resulting in more stable and secure operation of grid. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The new unified system will benefit local consumers, who will be able to participate through demand response and on-demand sustainable transit, which saves them money both on electricity and on transit costs, while providing more convenience and flexibility.  The research will benefit the university, and will be widely disseminated through interactions with utilities, auto industry, conferences, seminars and workshops. There will be outreach to local schools and communities to develop and plan for local energy and transportation needs and to heighten electric vehicle awareness. This project will support West Virginia?s Vision 2015 strategic plan to make research and innovation as number one driver of West Virginia's economy.",
