The increase in project complexity and shorter schedules pose pressure to develop more efficient construction methods. This also challenges educators to prepare students to manage these multifaceted processes.</p>\n<p>The goal of the Virtual Construction Simulator (VCS) is to improve engineering education in building and construction using an interactive construction project simulation game. The VCS is an experiential simulation environment where students can make decisions about resources, methods, cost/time trade-offs and related risks and observe the impact of these decisions over time, thus actively learning to manage various factors that impact construction schedules. The immediate feedback allows students to track their own progress, while the competition and scoring introduces fun for more engaged, motivated and deeper learning of complex construction concepts.</p>\n<p><strong>Virtual Construction Simulator Development<br /></strong>With the latest round of funding, the researchers addressed the VCS game&rsquo;s ability to support the learning of complex thinking skills. To achieve this goal, the researchers developed the fourth generation of Virtual Construction Simulator. This version of the Virtual Construction Simulator (VCS4) was designed to enhance the learning process by leveraging previous research in the field of construction, visualization, human-computer interaction, educational psychology, and game-based learning. The team widened the target audience, implementation environment, and learning objectives for the game. The team designed and developed new game&rsquo;s mechanics, structure, aesthetics, and user interactions.</p>\n<p>The researchers supported their goal of developing the VCS4 by placing a strong consideration for the engagement of problem-solving processes. The team achieved this by developing a model of cognition. Future researchers can use this model to evaluate the cognitive and metacognitive processes that a learner might use to solve other types of complex construction problems. This model can also be leveraged for the development of other types of visual representations in construction education. Lastly, the experience of leveraging problem-solving literature to design a model of thinking processes can serve as an example for developing future educational simulation games.<br /><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Development of Assessment, Implementation, and Customization Framework<br /></strong>The researchers also developed a framework to support the implementation, assessment, and customization of VCS4. The implementation framework provides instructors and researchers with guidelines and best practices to facilitate the application of the VCS4 modules in classrooms and research environments. The framework defines the number of modules and the order of implementation that can maximize the learners&rsquo; learning and engagement based on research results. The presented work illustrates how an implementation framework can be developed by leveraging evidence-based research. Future researchers can leverage the work to conduct future research on instructional scaffolding. Therefore, this research supports both future implementers and future researchers in understanding the value of planned instructional scaffoldings.</p>\n<p>The developed assessment framework supports future construction researchers and instructors in evaluating problem-solving skills. The instruments can be applied or modified in any classroom environment. The framework provides instructors with rubrics for evaluating student responses. By documenting the assessment instrument development process, the researchers have shown how an assessment instrument can be aligned to elements present in the educational simulation game. This was achieved by mapping the problem-solving skills designed in the cognition model to the visual representations in the game. This development process can be used by future instructors and developers to design assessment instruments that are aligned game elements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Theoretical Findings<br /></strong>The VCS4 instructional package was implemented in several advanced undergraduate construction engineering courses. The researchers designed an implementation procedure to understand: the educational gains from playing each of the game&rsquo;s modules; if the students were able to transfer their skills from one module onto the next one; and how many modules and with which order should an instructor implement the modules. The findings illustrate that construction engineering education can be supported through game-based learning experiences. Based on the results, the researchers were able to provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the chosen sample of construction students were able to gain and transfer problem-solving skills necessary to solve complex construction simulation problems, by playing all of the modules, no matter what order with which they were played. This conclusion provides evidence that construction educational simulation games can be used not only to engage and motivate students, but also to support users in gaining and transferring a range problem-solving skills. This is achieved not only by showing that the game&rsquo;s modules can be used as instructional scaffolds, but also by giving direction to future instructors on how they can implement the game. Also, by illustrating how educational simulation games can support a range of problem-solving skills, further validates how such games should be implemented in learning environments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/17/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;I&nbsp;Messner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1226204/1226204_10205983_1484653495148_1-StartScreen--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1226204/1226204_10205983_1484653495148_1-StartScreen--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Virtual Construction Simulator 4 -
