 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will evaluate how ocean warming contributed to past ice sheet dynamics through study of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) through early Holocene behavior of ice streams draining into Baffin Bay. This research will provide a new context for understanding ice sheet response to past warm periods, in particular, the B\u00f8lling/Allerod interstadial period, which hosted rapid sea level rise and abrupt climate warming after the LGM. At the LGM the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) was one of three large ice sheets terminating via large, fast flowing ice streams into Baffin Bay. This project will\r\nstudy the past history, dynamics, and ice-sheet ocean interactions in Baffin Bay, and the role of ocean warming in ice sheet demise, via multi-proxy analysis of existing (2008 and 2009) sediment cores from the West Greenland continental slope. Data from this proposal will be used to model freshwater flux from the ice streams, and will provide new information on what role the Greenland Ice Sheet played in past sea-level rise as the LGM ice sheet began to shed as much as 4.6 m of sea level equivalent.  The research will test three hypotheses using foraminiferal faunas, sediment mineralogy, stable isotope analyses, stratigraphy of iceberg rafted detritus (IRD), and visible diffuse spectral reflectance data:\r\n1. The western margin of the GIS advanced during stadials and retreated during interstadials in\r\nresponse to the presence or absence of ocean warming via the West Greenland Current.\r\n2. Peaks of ice-berg rafted material (IRD) result from two distinct processes: Proximal IRD is\r\nderived from retreat of the GIS off the shelf edge, whereas distal IRD results from collapse of the\r\nLaurentide Ice Sheet and Innutian Ice Sheet/NW Greenland margins in northern Baffin Bay.\r\n3. Advection of warm water along the West Greenland margin causes enhanced melting of\r\nnorthern Baffin Bay icebergs and sea ice at the polar front, forming an IRD belt along the W.\r\nGreenland margin, which preserves a record of ice sheet-discharge events under conditions of\r\nocean warming.\r\n\r\n The GIS is losing mass in response to modern warming. It stores enough fresh water to raise global sea level by 6.5 m, making its sensitivity to warming a major societal concern. It is anticipated that the sensitivity and response of the GIS to past warming, which are the foci of this project, will help constrain projections of the future evolution of the GIS.",

Using a multi-proxy approach the research successfully addressed all of its original goals, greatly improving the understanding of the past extent of the large ice streams draining into Baffin Bay from central west Greenland and also learning how the ice streams responded to the forcing of warm ocean water at its grounding line.  We learned that two central west Greenland ice streams both retreated from the shelf edge under the influence of shoaling, warm Atlantic Water that lurked initially at depths below the ice grounding lines.  We found that the deeper of the two systems retreated first, but that the ice sheet was protected from accelerating mass loss (calving) by a projecting ice shelf and by uphill bathymetry on the outer shelf.  Calving retreat was delayed until c. 15.2 cal ka BP, during another interval of ocean warming.  Another important finding is that the other ice sheet margins draining into Baffin Bay periodically released cold, fresh water that enhanced sea ice formation and slowed melting of the GIS.  This is especially apparent in the formation of a large grounding zone wedge in the Uummannaq Trough that formed when the ice margin stabilized, prior to and during the Younger Dryas cold period (12.8-11.6 cal ka BP).  At this time, the central West Greenland records document strong cooling, lack of GIS meltwater, and an increase in glacigenic sediments (ice berg rafted material) from northern Baffin Bay.  The ice sheet remained in the cross-shelf troughs until the early Holocene, when is retreated rapidly by calving and strong melting under the influence of atmosphere and ocean warming and a steep reverse slope toward the deep fjords.  One of the key cores of this study, 2008029-12PC, provided additional important information on the environment that existed in Baffin Bay during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).  Because we were able to obtain multiple radiocarbon dates from this core on the Disko Trough Mouth Fan, we can use multiple lines of evidence of biological activity in Baffin Bay that there was no full ice shelf formed from advance of the Hudson Strait Ice Stream that grounded on the Davis Strait and filled Baffin Bay.  That result calls into question the modeling studies that use such an ice shelf to explain the mechanics of Heinrich events. \n\n \n\nThis project is an international effort that has drawn together researchers and students from the US, UK, Canada and Denmark.
