Five items were submitted for review. In order of priority they were:\r\n\r\n1)\tTransmissometer\t$4,057\r\n2)\tOcean Instruments Multi-Corer 800\t\t\t$ 35,845\t\r\n3)\tOcean Instruments Mark-III Box Corer\t\t         $ 34,980\t\r\n4)\tpH sensor\t\t\t\t\t\t  $1,455\r\n5)\tFluorometers-CTD & Flow-through\t\t\t$ 29,733\r\n                          TOTAL \t                           $106,070\r\n\r\n\t\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\tThe principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",
