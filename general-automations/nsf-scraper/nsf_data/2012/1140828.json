 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators are developing an integrated, multidisciplinary undergraduate molecular forensics curriculum that fosters an experimental mindset, providing a platform to transform the way students experience the application of technology in scientific discovery. Combining analytical procedures in microbiology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics with algorithmic and computational skills in computer science, the program is engaging students across the College of Science and Mathematics and the College of Engineering in educational experiences involving cutting-edge applied research through the lens of an initial focus: production of a working database of E. coli fingerprints for use in tracking environmental contamination.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum is being delivered to over 1,000 students each year in multiple inquiry-based courses. These courses lay the foundation for a new emphasis in molecular forensics at Cal Poly, which leads students from the field, where E. coli is collected, to the laboratory, where the bacterial DNA is amplified and sequenced, to the computer, where the data are evaluated and archived in a database. Each lab module engages undergraduates in research with broad applications in the areas of food and water safety. Molecular forensics modules are integrated into the core of introductory courses at the Foundation level (freshman/sophomore), linking microbiology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics. At the Integration level (junior/senior), focused courses guide students in the construction and use of databases in molecular forensics. Two bioinformatics courses, one for life sciences majors and one for computer science majors, are being taught in concert to provide students with project-based experiences in multidisciplinary team settings. The student experience culminates at the Application level (senior project capstone) with teams of students working on research with environmental and health applications using the forensic database created in the program.\r\n\r\nThe project is cultivating an undergraduate research community while contributing to the field of molecular forensics. As diseases caused by food-and-water-borne bacterial pathogens continue to be a major public health issue, the importance of developing efficient methods for tracking the sources of outbreaks cannot be overemphasized. Throughout the molecular forensics curriculum, students are contributing to the development of solutions for rapid identification of contamination sources in recreational and potable water as well as food supplies. Computer science students are gaining the real-world experience of working directly with clients in the development of science-specific software applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur multidisciplinary Molecular Forensics (MF) program at California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly), partially funded by this NSF-TUES award, is an example of how to fold a large-scale data-intensive interdisciplinary research program into a variety of different undergraduate courses across curricula in several departments. \n\nThe MF program integrated two project-based instructional modules into existing laboratory curricula in lower division undergraduate biology courses: Introductory Cell and Molecular Biology (BIO 161) and General Microbiology I (MCRO 224).  Students in these courses isolate and confirm E. coli from known fecal sources (MCRO 224) then fingerprint them (BIO 161) and compare the fingerprints to our publically accessible database, the Cal Poly Library of Pyroprints (CPLOP.org).  CPLOP now contains pyroprints from over 8000 purified strains of E. coli and is used by multiple upper division and graduate students in the MF program.  Currently, the program\u00c6s lower division research modules are fully incorporated in these two courses, serve over 1000 students per year, and are supported by all faculty teaching the courses.  Students given these introductory tastes of participation in research report the modules as among their favorite laboratory experiences in the class, and the pool of students applying to work in the MF program at a higher level has increased. \n\nMuch of the class participation outside introductory courses was designed to bring the project up to speed.  Upper division course participation included initial work on the pyroprint database in Database Design, Modeling, and Implementation (CSC 366), an upper-division elective course in the Computer Science/Software Engineering curriculum.  The MF program was also used to pilot an interdisciplinary method for teaching called \"teaching in concert\".  To introduce students from both biology and computer science to computational problems in biology, aspects of the MF program were explored in two courses: Bioinformatics Algorithms (CSC 448) and Bioinformatics Applications (BIO/CHEM 441). CSC 448 is designed for computer science students and deals with computational problems in biology and the algorithms required for their solution.  BIO/CHEM 441 introduces biochemistry and biology majors to analysis of biological information using a wide range of public databases.  Issues in the design of the functionalities for the MF program were discussed in both classes, side by side, with laboratory time in common.  The pilot was a success and provided the MF program with quality control data for E. coli fingerprint analysis.\n\nStudent participation on a sustained level continues in the form of upper-division research-focused students taking independent study course credit to work in the MF program.  These courses include: Special Problems for Advanced Undergraduates (BIO 400), Senior Project &ndash; Research (BIO 462), Advanced Undergraduate Research (CHEM 401), Honors Research (BIO/CHEM 463), Special Problems (CSC400).  Students are currently designing software upgrades to the CPLOP database, exploring methods for determining rates of false positive matching between E. coli strains, examining E. coli diversity in a wide range of animal hosts, and working with local authorities to determine fecal contamination sources in local watersheds.\n\nThe MF program accomplishments to date include:\n\n1)   Proof of concept for the integration of an interdisciplinary research program into undergraduate courses across curricula in several departments (Computer Science, Biological Sciences, and Chemistry).\n\n2)   Proof of concept for \"teaching in concert\", where side-by-side courses in Bioinformatics from the Biology/Chemistry perspective and the Computer Science perspective allow students in each discipline to learn from each other and interact as area experts in their own discipline.\n\n3)   Development of a strain library and research database of E. coli finge..."
