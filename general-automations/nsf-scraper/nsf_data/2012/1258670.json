 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports Professors Lawrence M. Pratt, at Fisk University in Nashville TN, and Marcus A. Tius at the University of Hawaii who will continue their efforts to better understand the structures and reaction mechanisms of lithium carbenoids. The project will use a combination of computational quantum chemistry and NMR spectroscopy to determine the structure of lithium carbenoids in solution, and their tendency to form mixed aggregates with other lithium compounds. Mixed aggregates are well known in organolithium chemistry, and they sometimes have dramatic effects on reactivity and selectivity. The reaction mechanisms studied to date have often been quite complex, and would be very difficult to elucidate without the use of computational chemistry. Preliminary work completed during the initial grant period has shown which computational methods are most appropriate for the problems in this study. The predictions of the reaction products, obtained from the calculated mechanisms, will be tested in the laboratory of the Tius synthetic group.  Frequently, two or more reaction mechanisms are operating concurrently, and changing the reaction conditions may enhance or suppress one mechanism. This sometimes results in improved reaction selectivity, purer products, and reductions in the production of toxic wastes. It may also show that the reagents being investigated are not ideal for a particular reaction, and may spur the search for alternate synthetic methods.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professors Lawrence M. Pratt, at Fisk University in Nashville TN, and Marcus A. Tius at the University of Hawaii will contribute to further understanding of lithium carbenoid reactions that can lead to a wider application in synthetic organic reactions. Organolithium reagents are ubiquitous in modern synthesis but little is known about the factors affecting their structure and reactivity. Broader impacts are in student education and training, with the largest impact on minority students. Fisk University is a Historically Black College/University (HBCU), with about 98% African-American and about 70% female students. The University of Hawaii is a collaborating institution, and is also committed to the inclusion of minorities in science. Louisiana Tech University is also a collaborating institution, with a large African-American student population and some joint faculty appointments with Grambling State University, another HBCU. A major impact of this research will be to revitalize the graduate (MS) program at Fisk, which had been hurt by economic conditions in recent years. A goal of this project is to help those students bridge into a program of their choice, possibly at one of the several research universities collaborating with Professor Pratt on this and other projects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe scientific outcomes of this project were a better understanding of the reactions of lithium carbenoids and other compounds that are structually similar.  Basically, a lithium carbenoid is a compound in which a lithium atom and an electronegative atom, such as oxygen, notrogen, fluorine, chlorine, or bromine, are attached to the same carbon atom.  This alters the reactivity from that of a carbanoion (carbon with a negative charge) to that of a divalent carbene, which undergoes a different set of reactions.  Most of the compounds that were studied during this grant period have reactivity intermediate between that of a carbanion and a carbene.\n\nIt was found that, like most other organolithium compounds, lithium carbenoids exist as aggregates of two or more units of the basic structure.  They are also solvated by ethers, including diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran (THF), two common solvents used in the study of these compounds.  With strongly coordinating solvents such as THF, high aggregates (tetramers and hexamers) break down into dimers, and sometimes, monomers.  Because of reduced steric crowding, these lower aggregates are sometimes more reactive than the higher aggregates.\n\nOne of the compounds examined in this work was oxiranyllithium, a three-membered C-C-O ring with a lithoum atom attached to one of the carbon atoms.  This compound is intermediate between a lithium carbenoid and carbanion, and it exhibits both types of reactions.  We used computational quantum chemistry methods to examine and better understand the different reaction types and why they occur.\n\nMixed aggregates are aggregates between the lithium carbenoid of interest and another lithium compound, freqently a simple salt like lithium chloride or lithium bromide.  It has been observed experimentally that one type of lithium carbenoid, 1-alkoxyallenyllithium (H2C=C=C(Li)-OCH3), is much more reactive in the presence of lithium salts (LiCl, LiBr).  Our computational and experimental results showed that several different mixed aggregates between 1-alkoxyallenyllithium and the salts are formed, and these are more reactive than the parent compound, apparently due to reduced steric hindrance as this compound approaches the electrophile prior to reaction.  The experimental part of this project, including synthesis of the alkoxyallenyllithiums and NMR studies, were performed by Marc Tius and his students at the University of Hawaii.\n\nAnother lithium carbanoid that we examined has not yet been observed, but we believe it can be synthesized.  While the synthetic attempts are underway, we examined its structure using computational quantum chemistry.  The compound is N=N=C(Li)-Ar, where Ar is an aromatic ring.  It was found that two different basis structures are possible.  The diazo group can be approximately colinear with the carbenoid carbon, or it can form a three-membered N-N-C ring.  Furthermore, when this compound forms a dimer, both diazo groups can be linear, both can be ring structures, or there can be one of each.  We are currently determining what effects solvation and steric effects have on the structures. \n\nThis project also served to train underrepresented minority students in the methods of computational quantum chemistry.  The project was started at Fisk University, an HBCU in Tennessee.  After the first year, the P. I. moved to Medgar Evers College, a minority-serving unit of the City University of New York (CUNY).  Working with students on this project was more challenging, since relatively few students take organic chemistry, and many do so in their senior year.  Neverless, one high school student from the P. I.'s general chemistry laboratory class was recruited to work on the project due to her interest and work ethic.  That work resulted in a publication, the first publication of this student's research career.  During the final year of the project, she and 5 additional students received training and worked on the diazo lithium carbenoid project..."
