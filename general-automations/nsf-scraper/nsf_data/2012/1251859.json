Specifically, the\r\ninvestigator and his collaborators develop a family of algorithms\r\nthat focus mainly on (1) Fast, high-order numerical solutions for\r\nwave-propagation problems in domains that contain geometric\r\nsingularities, and (2) Scattering problems from penetrable\r\nelectromagnetic periodic structures, with a particular emphasis\r\non resonant problems relevant to the design of photonic crystals\r\nand Negative Index Materials (NIM).  The investigator\r\nconcentrates on development and implementation of a massively\r\nparallel computational framework based on integral equation\r\nformulations capable of producing fast and high-order solutions\r\nof wave scattering problems of realistic complexity.  The\r\napproach consists of the following main elements: (a) High-order\r\nresolution of the singularities of the solutions of the boundary\r\nintegral equations in non-smooth domains; (b)\r\nPseudodifferential-calculus-based design and analysis of\r\nwell-conditioned integral equation formulations leading to small\r\nnumbers of Krylov-subspace iterations for a wide range of\r\nelectromagnetic transmission problems; and (c) Use of equivalent\r\nsources, FFT-based acceleration algorithms, and implementations\r\nthat take advantage of the newly available Graphic Processing\r\nUnits (GPUs) computational platforms to dramatically enhance\r\ncomputational times and capabilities. \r\n\r\n     The algorithms that are developed as part of this project\r\nare of fundamental significance to diverse applications such as\r\nelectromagnetic interference and compatibility (electronic\r\ncircuits), dielectric/magnetic coated conductors, and composite\r\nmeta-materials (photonic crystals and Negative Index Materials). \r\nThe simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation in complex\r\nstructures gives rise to a host of significant computational\r\nchallenges that result from non-coercive formulations,\r\noscillatory solutions, geometric singularities, resonances, and\r\nill-conditioning in the high-frequency regime.  The recent\r\nefforts of the investigator and his collaborators resulted in the\r\ndevelopment of a highly efficient computational methodology that\r\nresolved several of these difficulties and whose extension\r\nenables the fulfillment of an ambitious plan: to simulate with\r\nhigh fidelity realistic scattering environments with a high\r\ndynamic range.",
