 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose to design, develop and characterize novel flexible, resorbable nanomaterials and devices for wound healing applications. The work is divided into three tasks to support the engineering of a resorbable system for wounding healing: a) the development of flexible, resorbable materials themselves containing resorbable, high-quality conductors (for use as interconnects and electrodes); b) the development of resorbable, biocompatible batteries; c) the use of implanted flexible -- ultimately resorbable? devices to map and control the electric field wound gradient in internal wounds. Additionally, the work leverages efforts at UCSF on internal wound healing in the context of anastomoses and the extensive experience of the Pediatric Device Consortium (www.pediatricdeviceconsortium.org/).\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nWhen implanting therapeutic electronic constructs within the body, a key concern is their removal after the therapeutic effect is complete. This need to remove such constructs has largely limited the deployment of electronic therapeutic systems to applications where they may be easily removed.  Specifically, it is typically unacceptable to leave such a device within the body, since gradual degradation of the device could introduce toxic materials in large quantities and sizes into the body.  The proposed effort lies at the intersection of nanomaterials, flexible electronics, and medical electronics. The effort brings together leading researchers in these fields. By leveraging the world-leading expertise of the individual researchers in each of these fields, the effort aims to achieve several dramatic innovations in medical electronics, including novel approaches to resorbable conductors and implantable, resorbable power sources. If successful, these efforts will create a body of knowledge and technology to enable the realization of sophisticated in-body therapeutic systems that leverage electrical stimulation to improve healing.  This systems approach at translating cutting edge flexible and resorbable electronics directly to the clinic has the potential to transform soft-tissue wound healing therapies. While there are efforts aimed at electronic systems on skin, these efforts are limited by the absence of materials and process development specifically for medical applications, and generally do not aim to develop therapeutic applications; at best therefore, they are diagnostically focused. Similarly, there are numerous efforts focused on flexible electronics, but only relatively simple in-body systems have been demonstrated. This research will provide high resolution, in-body mapping of the wound gradient field in a minimally invasive way and will impact the knowledge and success of cell recovery in many medical procedures. Likewise, the impact of a demonstration of successful stimulation to affect internal wound healing in a controlled or predictable manner would be very high. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe effort will introduce a multi-facetted education and outreach program, targeted at increasing recruitment and retention of high-school students into science and engineering, and extending opportunities to underrepresented minorities at all levels of education from school to university.  Opportunities for high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students, as well as underrepresented minorities at all levels will be provided, and will be matched to research within the effort.  In addition to research opportunities, seminars and tutorials will be organized to develop interest in flexible electronics for medical applications. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in performing this work. Undergraduates will be engaged in experimental design and metrology tutorials to prepare them for future careers in research.  The results of this proposal will also be used in a University-sponsored high-school outreach program.  High-school students will be invited to visit the laboratory and to gain hands-on experience.  Finally, specific programs targeting recruitment of minority students will be developed as part of this project, with the goal of providing opportunities, training, and mentorship at all levels for minority students to drive their retention and success in STEM field.",

Through a vibrant, continuous and extremely productive collaboration between researchers and clinicians at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, San Francisco, a number of successful technologies were developed and transitioned from laboratory into early clinical tests. Several examples of the innovations that resulted from this funded effort are illustrated below.</p>\n<p><strong>A technology for monitoring and predicting pressure ulcers (Figure 1).</strong> When pressure is applied to a localized area of the body for an extended time, the resulting loss of blood flow and subsequent reperfusion to the tissue causes cell death and a pressure ulcer develops. Preventing pressure ulcers is challenging because the combination of pressure and time that results in tissue damage varies widely between patients, and the underlying damage is often severe by the time a surface wound becomes visible. Prior to our work, no method existed to detect early tissue damage and enable intervention. We demonstrated a flexible, electronic device that non-invasively mapped pressure-induced tissue damage, even when such damage cannot be visually observed. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of an automated, non-invasive &lsquo;smart bandage&rsquo; for early detection of pressure ulcers. The technology was translated in a collaboration with Dr. David Young, M.D. at the University of California, San Francisco, who is now leading an effort to commercialize the technology.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible technologies for medical devices (Figure 2).</strong> More broadly, bioelectronic interfaces require electrodes that are mechanically flexible and chemically inert. Flexibility allows pristine electrode contact to skin and tissue, and chemical inertness prevents electrodes from reacting with biological fluids and living tissues. Flexible gold electrodes are ideal for bioimpedance and biopotential measurements such as bioimpedance tomography, electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG), and electromyography (EMG). However, prior to this effort, a manufacturing process to fabricate gold electrode arrays on plastic substrates was elusive. Khan and colleagues demonstrated a fabrication and low-temperature sintering (&asymp;200 &deg;C) technique to fabricate gold electrodes. Overall, the fabrication process of an inkjet-printed gold electrode array that was electrically reproducible, mechanically robust, and promising for bioimpedance and biopotential measurements was demonstrated.</p>\n<p><strong>A Magnetic compression anastomosis (Magnamosis): from bench to trials (Figure 3,4). </strong>Intestinal anastomosis is fundamental to general surgery. Currently, most anastomoses are either hand-sewn or made with stapling devices, but a device that could automatically and consistently produce an optimal anastomosis could reduce morbidity and save significant operative time and resources. The concept of compression anastomosis is first credited to French physician Felix-Nicholas Denans in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century. Magnetic compression anastomosis (&ldquo;magnamosis&rdquo;) is a modern iteration of this classic idea, which uses the force of magnetic attraction to form an intestinal anastomosis without sutures or staples. &nbsp;&nbsp; As part of this work, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco pioneered new technologies which leveraged the magnamosis concept. &nbsp;The Magnamosis&Ocirc; device (Magnamosis, Inc., San Francisco, CA) is a matched pair of self-centering, rare earth magnets encased in polycarbonate. The two rings self-align and self-center, and the mated rings compress the interposed tissue. The device produces a gradient of compressive forces on the bowel wall that causes transmural ischemia and necrosis centrally, but allows for remodeling of the intestine at the periphery, to gradually form a full-thickness anastomosis. In extensive pre-clinical testing, including animal trials in over 90 pigs and 10 monkeys, we have demonstrated the device&rsquo;s ability to consistently create histologically well-formed anastomoses with burst strength comparable to or better than hand-sewn or stapled anastomoses.</p>\n<p><strong>Impedance spectroscopy for monitoring bone healing.</strong> Lastly, new and successful efforts have grown out of the work supported by these funds. One example, is multi-year, multi-investigator project focused on applying the impedance spectroscopy technology used to detect pressure ulcers to the healing of bones; this work is being performed by researchers in the Maharbiz lab at the University of California, Berkeley and researchers and clinicians at the University of California, San Francisco in the Center for Disruptive Musculoskeletal Innovations (CDMI). Accurate evaluation of fracture healing is important for clinical decisions on when to begin weight-bearing and when early intervention is necessary in cases of fracture nonunion. While the stages of healing have been well characterized, physicians typically track fracture healing by using subjective physical examinations and radiographic techniques that are only able to detect mineralized stages of bone healing. This exposes the need for a quantitative, reliable technique to monitor fracture healing. Recently, we showed that impedance spectroscopy not only can distinguish between cadaver tissues involved throughout fracture repair, but also correlates to fracture callus composition over the middle stages of healing. Work towards the development of implantable devices for monitoring bone healing is well underway.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/19/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Maharbiz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1240380/1240380_10198757_1503182782289_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1240380/1240380_10198757_1503182782289_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1240380/1240380_10198757_1503182782289_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Flexible impedance spectroscopy technology for detecting pressure ulcers.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sarah Swisher,  University of California, Berkeley</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Maharbiz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1240380/1240380_10198757_1503182872539_Slide2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1240380/1240380_10198757_1503182872539_Slide2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1240380/1240380_10198757_1503182872539_Slide2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Inkjet-Printed Flexible Gold Electrode Arrays for Bioelectronic Interfaces</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yasser Khan, University of California, Berkeley</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Maharbiz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1240380/1240380_10198757_1503183021241_Slide3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1240380/1240380_10198757_1503183021241_Slide3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1240380/1240380_10198757_1503183021241_Slide3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Magnamosis concept</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anupama Arun, University of California, San Francisco</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Maharbiz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1240380/1240380_10198757_1503183098914_Slide4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1240380/1240380_10198757_1503183098914_Slide4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1240380/1240380_10198757_1503183098914_Slide4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Testing configuration for magnamosis rings.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anupama Arun, University of California, San Francisco</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Maharbiz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
