 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Graduate and Transfer STEM Talent Expansion Program at Montgomery College -- a public, culturally diverse, three-campus community college -- provides a systematic and comprehensive approach to increasing the number of students who attain an associate's degree and/or transfer to four-year institutions as STEM majors. Major foci of the program include 1) revision of gateway STEM courses to incorporate active-learning strategies and supplemental instruction, 2) engagement of students in research, within and beyond the classroom, early in their undergraduate years, and 3) technology-assisted mathematics tutoring for pre-calculus students. These core strategies are supported by enhanced academic advising and support, faculty and peer mentoring, a summer bridge program for entering students, and professional development of faculty and staff across the three campuses.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project builds on well-established best practices for increasing retention in and recruitment of students into STEM degree and transfer programs. Project elements are being developed in parallel at each of the three Montgomery College campuses; project staff members then engage in system-wide dissemination and professional development of faculty and staff. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The project is increasing the number of students who attain an associate's degree and/or transfer to four-year institutions as STEM majors, with particular emphasis on serving the diverse students and returning veterans who attend Montgomery College. In the longer term, the project enhances institutional capacity (e.g., curricular reform, support structures, and professional development) for continued support of increased STEM degree attainment and transfer. In addition, it is serving as a model approach to developing and integrating a systematic program across a multiple-campus community college, which informs institutions considering similar efforts elsewhere in the nation.",

With the exception of the first year, the program's graduation and transfer goals were reached. Contributing factors toward the negative outcome in year one included the grant's late start in mid-fall 2012, and lag-time needed to organize, pilot, and establish grant activities to reach grant goals.</p>\n<p>Efforts throughout the grant period were focused on different recruitment and retention strategies to reach goals. These strategies as mentioned in the intellectual merit and broader impacts of the grant proposal, evolved out of realized need, and came into being after deliberate discussion and testing. All strategies were carried out throughout the duration of the grant and were successful in terms of supporting the goals of the program and included the following:</p>\n<p>Outcome of Recruitment Strategies: The logic of recruitment strategies is that they lead to increased numbers of students declaring STEM majors. The various means used for GT STEP student recruitment were:</p>\n<p>1) sending program and MC STEM-related event information to Montgomery County Public School counselors; 2) sending postcard and e-mail communications to parents of high school seniors coming to MC; 3) supporting and participating in MC STEM Open House events for the public and non-program MC students; 4) launching the GT STEP website; 5) housing three STEM Information Centers within Tutoring Service buildings; 6) advertising using flyers and big screen TVs; and 7) having personal interaction in STEM classrooms.</p>\n<p>Outcome: From our experience, the most effective form of recruitment was through modes of interpersonal connections (3, 5, and 7 above). These modes employed direct face-to-face interactive communication styles. By year three of the grant, the program had become so successful that our reputation, communicated via program students directly to new students, became a powerful driver of recruitment. Overall, we recruited 453 STEM majors into our program, where we had proposed 375 over the grant duration, which is 20% higher than anticipated.</p>\n<p>Outcome of Retention Strategies: The logic of retention strategies is that they help to prevent and keep more students from dropping out of school, withdrawing from a class, or switching to a non-STEM major due to a complex interaction of personal, social, and academic problems.</p>\n<p>The retention activities that addressed the intellectual merit and broader impacts of the GT STEP grant, along with their outcomes, included the following:</p>\n<p>a. Undergraduate Research Experience (URE): Independent Research and Internships. The grant allowed us to create and establish a new course for STEM students to do independent research (SCIR 297-Scientific Research), provide fully-paid internships at local federal, institutional and academic institutions, and provide a &ldquo;research-like&rdquo; experience from newly redesigned inquiry-based laboratory exercises in gateway chemistry and biology courses. URE was a proven driver of academic success and we were proud to extend URE opportunities to 6,708 students!</p>\n<p>b. Assignment of STEM faculty to project students. This outcome was successful as we provided an academic advisor for all 453 GT STEP students. Frequent semesterly academic monitoring and early intervention helped to keep 68% of our students retained as full-time and on track for graduation and / or transfer to 4-year institutions.</p>\n<p>c. Academic Support Services outcome was increasingly effective, affecting 2926 students. The grant allowed us to hold weekly group review/homework sessions for gateway STEM courses (all STEM fields) run by STEM faculty and peer-tutors; online STEM discipline-specific tutoring / advising; and enhanced college-wide tutoring services for the established Math/Science Centers. Group review/homework sessions allowed us to employ 84 peer-tutors. The Learning Assistant Program provided 240 STEM majors a chance to teach and tutor STEM classes in order to see if they would like to consider STEM teaching as a career. This also helped to address the national call for an increase in qualified personnel to teach STEM classes at the K-12 levels.</p>\n<p>d.

The website served as a useful resource for program, STEM curricula, and events information in each discipline, and further served as a STEM communications center for thousands of MC students and faculty.</p>\n<p>e. STEM Curricula changes in redesigned chemistry and biology labs and establishment of Scientific Research course (see \"a\" above) had a great outcome and also helped to build capacity among and establish a cohesive STEM faculty community through curriculum improvement.</p>\n<p>f. The Program for Active Learning in STEM (PALS) built capacity by providing professional development experience to 37 STEM faculty, enabling them to incorporate various modes of active learning into their classes.</p>\n<p>g.
