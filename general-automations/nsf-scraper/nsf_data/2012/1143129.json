 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate the technical and\r\ncommercial feasibility of a novel approach called Power Fingerprinting (PFP) for integrity assessment\r\nand intrusion detection in critical embedded and wireless systems based on side-channel analysis by an\r\nexternal monitor. Such integrity assessment approach is fundamental for protecting critical\r\nsystems from cyber attacks in government agencies, financial institutions, military command,\r\nand industrial control. PFP treats cyber security as a signal detection and classification problem and\r\nintroduces tangible quantitative metrics for security and trust. Phase I objectives include: (1) demonstrate\r\nthe feasibility of characterizing kernel modules and core applications for embedded systems; 2) extract\r\nbehavioral signatures to improve performance; 3) develop techniques to compensate for variations in\r\npower consumption due to manufacturing and environmental variations; and 4) create a general\r\narchitecture for the application of PFP. The research will be performed using Angstrom Linux on a\r\nBeagleboard embedded platform, from which PFP signatures will be extracted and used to detect\r\nmalicious intrusions in blind tests. The expected result is to achieve over 95% accuracy in detecting\r\nexecution anomalies during blind tests and provide a baseline to develop a commercial PFP monitor\r\nprototype in Phase II.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the development of an innovative\r\nmechanism for early detection of cyber attacks to critical infrastructure from well-funded adversaries.\r\nSuch attacks, if not promptly discovered, that can steal state secrets and intellectual property with\r\ndevastating consequences to national security. PFP brings a new perspective to cyber security treating it\r\nas a signal detection and classification problem and introducing tangible quantitative metrics for integrity\r\nand trust. PFP addresses a growing need to secure critical embedded systems. PFP is very difficult to\r\nevade, adds little overhead in the processor being monitored, and is effective against zero-day attacks. In\r\ncomparison, traditional cyber security monitoring approaches are susceptible to evasion and ineffective\r\nagainst new attacks because they depend on known malware signatures. These features make PFP capable\r\nof detecting sophisticated covert attacks and rootkits, such as the recent Stuxnet worm. PFP has dual\r\napplication in the commercial and government markets, particularly for resource-constrained and\r\nembedded platforms, including smart phones, smart grid, critical industrial control, and tactical\r\ncommunication devices. PFP has the potential to become a fundamental player in cyber-security by\r\nprotecting the nation?s infrastructure and promoting further development of the economic base and\r\nemployment.",
