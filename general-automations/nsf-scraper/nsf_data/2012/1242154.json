 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, \"NUE: NanO StUdio: An Immersive Ambience for Nano Educational Experiences\", at Ohio University under the direction of Dr. Savas Kaya, will establish an innovative and immersive educational platform, the nanO stUdio, for undergraduates at Ohio University.  The nanO stUdio is a publicly accessible showroom run by a team of undergraduates and designed to impress audio-visually and provide hands-on educational experiences related to nanomaterials, nanostructures, nanosensors, nanodevices and advanced microscopy techniques. The nanO stUdio is the product of a vision to bring the nano-scale science and engineering out of the sterile clean room environments to the public level where both the students and visitors can explore new developments, and have a realistic and correct understanding of the materials, devices and capabilities endowed by nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe proposed learning studio concept goes well beyond the development of a conventional laboratory component or courseware, which has been the focus of many NUE proposals to date.  In addition to the major objective of undergraduate student recruitment and training, the project also provides a means for the area high school students, parents and other interested parties to learn about principles and tools used in nanoscience and nanoengineering. As a crosscutting program, it will also provide summer research opportunities and stipends for the undergraduate students in the impoverished and underserved southeastern corner of Ohio bordering West Virginia and Kentucky.",
