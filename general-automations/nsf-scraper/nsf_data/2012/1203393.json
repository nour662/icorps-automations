 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs have successfully developed a high-resolution unstructured-grid, finitevolume\r\ncoupled ice-ocean model for the Arctic Ocean (AO-FVCOM). AO-FVCOM has been\r\nvalidated via comparison to observed data under climatological conditions. Now they seek support to work on the following three tasks: \r\n1) Calibrate and validate AO-FVCOM using observational data collected in the Canada Arctic Basin and its marginal Chukchi and Beaufort Sea. This region is chosen for intense study because it has the most pronounced loss of sea ice extent and thickness in recent years and its unprecedented coverage by multiyear national and international field and modeling studies. \r\n2) Apply the new calibrated and validated AV-FVCOM to investigate the following scientific topics: \r\na) improve understanding of the circulation of the Alaskan Coastal Current and Pacific and Atlantic waters in the study region, \r\nb) revisit scientific questions and methodological problems associated with shelf-basin exchange (SBE) processes in the region, and \r\nc) apply AO-FVCOM to investigate transformations and transports of fresh water (both liquid and solid) from freshwater sources (Bering Strait, rivers, central Beaufort Gyre, precipitation) towards the North Atlantic Ocean via Fram and Canadian Archipelago Straits. \r\n3) Train a Ph.D. student in advanced Arctic Ocean modeling.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this project will provide an additional protocol for modeling Arctic Ocean processes.  It will also advance understanding of the circulation and mixing processes in the Arctic Ocean, processes which will grow in socio-economic importance with increasing ice loss and development activities in this part of the globe.",

The summer sea-ice concentration, for instance, has decreased considerably since the 1970s. The observed change in sea ice is undoubtedly due to interactions between the atmosphere and ocean. Among these three components, the ocean remains the least observed and also likely the least understood. More observations, improvements in numerical models and a better theoretic framework/model are all needed in the Arctic physical oceanography. A state-of-art Arctic Ocean model requires: (1) flexible and high resolution horizontal and vertical grids to represent the complex coastline, steep continental slopes and strong upper ocean stratification; (2) mass conservation to accurately simulate mass, heat and salt transformations and transports; (3) proper parameterization of vertical and lateral mixing, (4) advanced data assimilation methods to integrate observations with simulation results; (5) modular design to facilitate selection and/or addition of essential model components needed in both process-oriented and hindcast/forecast applications; and (6) the ability to resolve regional Arctic features. Some examples of these regional features include (i) the sharp Arctic halocline which creates the stratification necessary to insulate perennial sea ice from the Pacific and Atlantic Water layers; (ii) the strong seasonal variability of sea surface height associated with large changes in atmospheric pressure; (iii) ice-tide interactions providing effective heat exchange between ocean and atmosphere; (iv) fast ice formation and break-up with very well pronounced specific atmosphere-ice-ocean interactions at the fast ice &ndash; pack ice edges; and (v) very strong and sometimes extreme river runoff. This model should also be an open-source ocean community model that can be accessed or used by scientists for particular applications and independent model comparison/validation studies.</p>\n<p>We have successfully developed a global-Arctic nested, high-resolution unstructured-grid, finite-volume coupled ice-ocean model for the Arctic Ocean (AO-FVCOM). AO-FVCOM is significantly different from existing Arctic Ocean structured-grid models due to the geometric flexibility inherent in the unstructured-grid approach and the local mass, momentum, heat, and salt conservation and computational efficiency inherent in the finite-volume approach. The geometric flexibility of this model enables detailed examination of multi-scale shelf-basin interactions in the Arctic, particularly over the shelfbreak and in the region connected to the Canadian Archipelago.</p>\n<p>This model has been validated via comparisons with 38-year (1978-2015) observational data collected in the Canada Arctic Basin and its marginal Chukchi and Beaufort Sea.
