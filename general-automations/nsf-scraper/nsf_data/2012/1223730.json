 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is derived from the outstanding results of a previous pilot study. In the pilot study, limited to the Philadelphia area, found that children and families learned and assimilated STEM concepts better when there was an integrated system that combined children's literature and hands-on/inquiry based STEM experiments. The new phase of this effort will explore more deeply some of the practices and add 10 more sites across the country. In adding this new cadre, the \"established\" practices will be challenged, new challenges will be discovered, and new cultures will engender new challenges. The project is a collaborative effort by the Franklin Institute, the University of Washington and the University of Delaware.\r\n\r\nBasic instructional materials will be given to the new sites and workshops will be held during the tenure of this award to establish the goals and objectives. Further, monthly teleconferences will keep everyone informed of issues and challenges that arise. In addition, due to the variation across the Nation in terms of culture and backgrounds, each new site will have the freedom to accommodate its clientele and maintain the standards.",

This project was designed to engage children and families in science and literacy learning through a suite of resources that connected children&rsquo;s literature and hands-on science exploration for underserved children and families in Philadelphia. In 2011, the project expanded to 10 sites nationally. TFI received additional NSF funding in 2012, for <em>Leap into Science Full-Scale Development, </em>which was designed to produce training resources for sites that would enhance their capacity for facilitating science learning. Training resources were disseminated to sites in July 2015 at an in-person conference in Philadelphia, and included a) a training framework, b) three instructional videos, c) a reflection guide, and d) a wikispace for program facilitators.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Summative evaluation results focused on two key issues: 1) use of new training resources and 2) impacts of training resources on facilitator&rsquo;s practices. Although all sites had not implemented the training resources at the time of data collection, there were indications of significant positive impacts for site leaders who did engage with the training resources. Facilitator impacts took three forms. Site leaders reported 1) shifting their overall approach (highlighting more concrete examples and providing more hands-on learning opportunities); 2) increased likelihood of framing the goals of their training session; and 3) changes in their specific training practices (modeling how to ask good questions, encouraging facilitators to ask questions themselves, and encouraging facilitators to reflect). Observations of facilitators implementing Leap into Science afterschool workshops confirmed that facilitators were engaging in various science teaching practices, including encouraging participants to make observations, explore, ask questions, predict, test, retest, reflect on how they were like scientists, and use books for scientific thinking and learning.</p>\n<p>In addition to the project evaluation, two research studies were conducted. A study designed to understand the scalability of Leap into Science, conducted by Jessica Luke at the University of Washington, used Coburn&rsquo;s (2003) framework of scale in education. Findings (Luke and Greenslit, 2015) suggest that Leap into Science successfully scaled according to Coburn&rsquo;s conceptualization of scale-up, with positive change in all four dimensions: <em>depth</em> in educators&rsquo; beliefs, social interactions, and pedagogical practices; <em>sustainability</em> via a supportive community of professionals and alignment with organizational culture; <em>spread</em> via the program and techniques becoming embedded in organizational routines and operations; and <em>shift</em> in ownership through site facilitators gaining authority and program-specific knowledge (Coburn, 2003; Luke &amp; Greenslit, 2015). Dr. Danielle Ford at the University of Delaware explored the ways in which children and adults engage with science content during the Leap into Science workshops. Four cases are used to illustrate the ways in which individual children and adults employ multiple modalities when engaging in science content and the extent to which scientific ideas emerge within and across text, image, talk, gesture, and interactions around materials and phenomena.</p>\n<p><em>Leap into Science Full Scale Development</em> strategically networked a diverse group of organizations including museums, libraries, school districts, universities, and public media to enhance, implement, and study Leap into Science<em> </em>resources in a variety of informal learning settings. It advanced project effectiveness and impact as well as enriched training resources to support high-quality science and literacy learning for youth and families across different populations. The network emerged as a model of cohesive collaborations among diverse partners that shared resources and strategies for engaging underserved children and adults in science and literacy. <em>Leap into Science Full Scale Development</em> increased the understanding of how science centers can partner with other community organizations to improve their engagement with underserved populations and positioned the network for future national dissemination.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/23/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dale&nbsp;Mccreedy</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1223730/1223730_10218955_1513967760457_LeapSItePartners--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1223730/1223730_10218955_1513967760457_LeapSItePartners--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Utah facilitators engaged in science\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1223730/1223730_10218955_1513967760457_LeapSItePartners--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Utah facilitators engaged in science\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Leap into Science facilitators investigate with magnifying glasses at in-person conference, July 2015</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Darry Moran</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dale&nbsp;Mccreedy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Utah facilitators engaged in science</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1223730/1223730_10218955_1513968157511_TFI-KidsScienceatWalnutStLibraryDec11th,2014--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1223730/1223730_10218955_1513968157511_TFI-KidsScienceatWalnutStLibraryDec11th,2014--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mother &amp; child explore balance\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1223730/1223730_10218955_1513968157511_TFI-KidsScienceatWalnutStLibraryDec11th,2014--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mother &amp; child explore balance\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Families explore balance at Leap into Science workshop at their local library</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Darryl Moran</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dale&nbsp;Mccreedy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mother & child explore balance</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1223730/1223730_10218955_1513967555961_SitePartnerTrainingworkshop2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1223730/1223730_10218955_1513967555961_SitePartnerTrainingworkshop2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NJ Facilitators explore measurement\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1223730/1223730_10218955_1513967555961_SitePartnerTrainingworkshop2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NJ Facilitators explore measurement\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Leap into Science facilitators explore activities at in-person conference, July 2015</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Darryl Moran</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dale&nbsp;Mccreedy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">NJ Facilitators explore measurement</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
