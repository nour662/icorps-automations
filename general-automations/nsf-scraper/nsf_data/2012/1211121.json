Attendance at this congress will provide a rich learning experience in the field of Developmental and Comparative Immunology for developing scientists by enabling them to interact directly with international leaders in the field.  The society will benefit from the influx of new talent and new ideas. Broader impacts include the following training benefits for students and postdoctoral fellows:  1) the experience of presenting their data at an international meeting for the first time; 2) the opportunity to meet and talk to other scientists with common interests in comparative immunology and the veterinary sciences; 3) the opportunity to receive feedback on their research from leaders in the field; 4) the opportunity to meet possible future mentors and collaborators; 5) the opportunity to experience an important function of the Society and to participate in this collegial and supportive community of scientists.  While much scientific communication now occurs via electronic media, there is no substitute for one-on-one interactive communication made possible at an international meeting of this kind.  It will foster future collaborations between young scientists based in Asia, Europe, Australia, and other parts of the world.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nFinal Report for IOS 1211121-Conference: International Travel for Students and Postdocs to attendthe 12th Congress of the International Society for Developmental and Comparative Immunology\n\nProject Outcomes\n\nFunding was requested for students in US laboratories to attend the 12th Congress of the International Society of Developmental and Comparative Immunology (ISDCI).  The meeting website was http://isdci12.net/ISDCI_Fukuoka/Home.html. The Society and the Congress focuses on research in immunology that is developmental and/or comparative in nature.  Most of the studies presented at this congress focus on the broad evolution of immune defenses in all animals including shellfish and other species used by humans for research or food production.  Other societies in immunology do not have this focus.  The Congress meets once\nevery three years, and the 12th Congress was held in Fukuoka, Japan from\nJuly 9-13, 2012.\n\nTwelve students or postdoctoral fellows from US laboratories\napplied for funding, and all received some NSF funds. The awards for the US\nstudents were based on availability of support for their travel from other funding sources and whether or not they had received travel awards for prior congresses.  Priority was given to applicants who had not previously received travel funds in order to encourage newer investigators to attend.  All students or postdocs who received travel funding attended the meeting and participated in 7 oral presentations and 11 poster presentations. \nThe gender breakdown was 6 female and 6 male students.  The level of education included 2 undergraduates, 7 Ph.D. students, and 3 postdocs.  The applicants were quite diverse in their country of origin and ethnicity.\n\nEvaluation of the applications was done by a committee that included two senior members of the Society and a Vice president of the Society.  Eligibility was based on membership in the society, an abstract that was evidence that they would present their data, proof of status as a student or postdoc.  Awards were based on the amount of the request and the current prices for travel to Japan, as evaluated by the committee members.  Funds from NSF were distributed to US students during the meeting in the form of a check in US dollars.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/13/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Louise A Rollins-Smith"
