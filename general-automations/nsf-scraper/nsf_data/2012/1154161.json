 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pathways to Careers in Mathematics and Computer Science (PACMACS) Bridge Expansion Program is a comprehensive package of financial, academic, and social support offered to undergraduates pursuing baccalaureate degrees in mathematics, actuarial science and/or computer science. Students are recruited from participants in pre-college programs at the college and incoming students. Once admitted to the university, students obtain financial support through the University Financial Aid Office and S-STEM funding. 18 students in three cohorts of 6 students are being provided annual awards of $10,000 each. Academic support includes faculty mentors, upper level undergraduate student mentors, tutoring services, problem solving workshops, and individualized attention in small classes. Social support includes seminars on college life and cultural diversity and peer support groups. Career support includes seminars on relevant careers, panel discussions with recent alumni, summer internships in local industry and the resources of the University Career Development Center. All support services and scholarships are being continued by the college after the award period to insure that all participants complete their degrees. By participating in this program, students are able to successfully transition from high school to rigorous undergraduate baccalaureate programs in the targeted areas; obtain degrees in these disciplines; pursue careers in science and technology; and hopefully, remain in the Philadelphia metropolitan area and become role models in their communities.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Although there are many pre-college programs designed to strengthen mathematical skills and raise student interest in mathematics and computer science, there is little support to assist students to transition into rigorous academic programs in these disciplines. This transition is especially difficult for students from public urban high schools with large minority populations. Many of the students are first generation college students and lack role models and family support systems. This program builds on the foundation laid by the pre-college programs and continues the academic and social support necessary for successful retention of this cohort of students. The leadership group has extensive experience with a pre-college program in mathematics and computer science, a program that targets women, and summer research programs. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This project allows students from diverse backgrounds with limited educational and financial means to acquire the necessary skills to become a part of the challenging and rapidly evolving fields of mathematical and computer sciences. The students targeted for scholarships may otherwise not receive a college education and their talent may be lost to society and themselves. Successful graduates have the education and training to pursue careers in these disciplines, serve as role models to their peers, and thus increase participation by underrepresented groups in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The program serves as a model for other colleges to strengthen the connection between their pre-college and undergraduate programs.",
