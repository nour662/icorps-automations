Novak and H. Wozniakowski.\u00a0Two volumes of the monograph have been published in 2008 and 2010.\u00a0These two volumes include 91 open questions.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report\n\nHow much faster are quantum computers than classical computers for important problems?  We introduced the concept of strong quantum speedup.  For given problem the strong quantum speedup, S, is defined as follows. S is the classical complexity divided by the quantum complexity.  We are particularly interested in problems where S is an exponential function of a parameter.  A different definition of speedup is often used, especially in the computational science literature.  It is T, which is defined as the cost of the best classical algorithm known divided by the cost of a quantum algorithm.  The advantage of speedup S is as follows.  If a problem enjoys speedup T someone may invent a better classical algorithm and therefore decrease T but speedup S cannot be decreased.  To obtain speedup S one must be able to compute good estimates of classical and quantum complexities.  Information-based complexity gives us the tools to do this.\n\nWe provide a number of problems which enjoy strong exponential quantum speedups.  One of the problems is the approximation of the ground state energy of an instance of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation with d degrees of freedom and relative error E.  The worst case classical complexity is exponential in d; we derived a quantum algorithm which solves the problem with cost polynomial in d and 1/E. \n\nA second example is the Poisson equation.  It plays a fundamental role in numerous areas of science and engineering, such as computational fluid dynamics, quantum mechanical continuum solvation, electrostatics, the theory of Markov chains, and is important in electronic structure calculations.  In the worst case classical setting the problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality.  We have provided a quantum algorithm whose cost is almost linear in d and polylogarithmic in 1/E.\n\nWork has continued on the tractability of multivariate problems.  Erich Novak and Henryk Wozniakowski published a three volume monograph on the subject.  The total number of pages in the three volumes is over 1600 and 149 open problems are listed for future research.  Henryk Wozniakowski won the Banach Prize for this work.  The third volume deals with algorithms that use function values for approximation of linear operators, such as multivariate integration and approximation, and a number of non-linear operators corresponding to the Poisson equation with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, the Fredholm equation of the second kind, the heat equation, and the Helmholtz equation.  These problems were studied in the worst case, randomized, and average case settings over standard unweighted and weighted smooth spaces of d-variate functions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph F Traub"
