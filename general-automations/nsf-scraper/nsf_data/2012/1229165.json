 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Latha Ramakrishnan from St. Cloud State University and colleagues Michael Jeannot, Mohammad Mahroof-Tahir, Lakshmaiah Sreerama and Mark Mechelke will acquire a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer system. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) understanding the evolution and function of GABAergic neurotransmission in planaria; (b) determination of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in the wastewater treatment;(c) verification of a kinetic model for headspace single-drop microextraction; (d) development of bioprocess technologies to produce ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass; and (e) design and synthesis of goniothalamin analogues to explore the natural product mechanism of action.\r\n\r\nA gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer vaporizes and separates a multi component mixture which then passes into the mass spectrometer where the components are ionized.  The mass spectrometer determines the mass/charge ratio of these particles (parent molecular ion and fragment ions). This highly sensitive technique allows determination of the masses of the particles, their chemical composition and enables one to deduce the structure of the substances in a complex mixture. The instrumentation provided by this award will provide faculty and students the opportunity to pursue research projects at St. Cloud University.  It will advance the training of many students in the use of this important and widely used analytical technique.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPer NSF's CASPAR (caspar.nsf.gov) database (2003-2012) for baccalaureate origin of chemistry Ph.D.'s, the chemistry program at St. Cloud State University is among the nation's top 10% of all private and public comprehensive institutions classified as Mater's (Comprehensive) I and II and ranked Number 1 in the state of Minnesota.  Acquisition of modern instrumentation such as the Agilent GC-MS (7890A/5975C) with CTC combi PAL auto sampler has enabled us to continue to provide our hallmark undergraduate research training and senior capstone experience to all of our graduates, thus preparing them for success in graduate school.  During the three years of this project, 35 undergraduate researchers, over 600 undergraduate students in multiple upper-level chemistry lab classes, and over 50 high school students have had the opportunity to gain hands-on training/experience on this instrumentation.  The undergraduate researchers working under the close mentorship of faculty advisors have asked diverse research questions and have made significant progress in the following areas: 1) determination of anti-depressants and other pharmaceuticals in wastewater; 2) design and synthesis of four different classes of potential anti-cancer drugs based on natural products; 3) method development for the determination and quantification of chemical messengers in a flatworm's brain; 4) chemical mixture analysis using a combination of GC-MS and MATLAB software engineering.  The outcomes from these research inquiries have been disseminated through two peer-reviewed publications, 17 student poster/paper presentations at local/regional research colloquium, and 1 faculty presentation at regional analytical chemist\u00c6s conference.  In addition, vertical integration of the theory and operation, and hand-on experience on this instrumentation in multiple chemistry lab classes has helped in preparing our graduates to be workforce ready.  With the recent launch of a professional science Master\u00c6s program in materials science and scientific instrumentation (first such program in the region), the five students in the first cohort and students in the future cohort are bound to gain in-depth knowledge about the operation and application of this fundamental analytical chemistry instrumentation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Latha Ramakrishnan"
