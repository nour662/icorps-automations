 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:\r\n\r\nThe objective of this program is to co-design circuits and algorithms for compressive/low rate wideband receivers that are robust to the non-idealities that arise with the large interferers that will be encountered in sensing and communication applications. The program thus provides two transformative perspectives:  (1) solving the interference problem in wideband applications using compressive sensing approaches, and (2) broadening the theoretical basis for compressive sensing to include systems with weak nonlinearity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is centered around two thrusts that combine circuit and matched compressive sensing approaches: (1) By combining observations on circuits (devices are linear for small amplitudes) and compressive sensing (randomized subsampling is an effective acquisition approach for frequency-sparse signals), the project is designing nonlinearity-aware analog-to-information converters that select samples that preserve linearity in the measurement process; (2) By combining prior knowledge on the communication environment (characterizations of common interferers) with algorithmic tools for interference cancellation, the project is designing demodulator sequences and matched recovery algorithms that account for the nonlinearity of the analog-to-information converter and enable \r\nDSP-based interference cancellation.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include innovations that enable much more efficient use of the very valuable communication spectrum.  Specifically, it affects the critical interference problem for wideband systems and the direction of the emerging field of compressive sensing. It impacts numerous applications, ranging from emerging cognitive radios to environmental sensing systems. Finally, the project includes an integrated program of active educational engagement at levels ranging from K-12 to graduate school.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWireless communications devices have become an indispensable part of people's everyday lives.  Because of the increasing numbers of users and their increasing demands on such devices, new wireless system architectures that allow sharing of the radio spectrum through opportunistic spectrum access are emerging.  Such architectures require receivers that can process a large part of the radio spectrum (i.e. have a large receiver bandwidth)  Likewise, receivers for various sensing tasks, such as environmental sensing, process large swathes of spectrum.\n\nAlthough the radio spectrum processed by a given receiver might be large, the occupancy of that spectrum might be limited to a few regions, termed a \"sparse\" radio spectrum.  In recent years, there has been extensive studies demonstrating that sparse signals can be processed very efficiently through a technique termed \"compressive sensing\", which exploits a small number of samples of the received signal and clever digital processing to recover the sparse signal, thereby greatly reducing the power consumption of the receiver.\n\nUnfortunately, wideband receivers will have to deal with interference from other radio devices in their spectrum.  And because that interference might come from a powerful nearby source such as a broadcast television tower, the power of the interferer might greatly exceed that of the signal of interest to the receiver.  Thus, the design of wideband receivers in the presence of strong interference is one of the most prominent problems in all of transceiver design, and there is interest in adapting clever digital signal processing approaches from compressive sensing to the problem.  But this presents a conundrum:  the excision of the interference in the digital signal processor requires that the signal has not been distorted in the early stage of the receiver so that it is accurately represented on the digital signal processor.  However, the interference \"floods\" the front-end of the receiver, where non-ideal effects of real circuits, in particular nonlinear effects caused by the large size of the interfering signal, greatly distort the signal representation on the digital signal processor and prevent signal recovery.  Hence, the interference must be mitigated in the early stages of the receiver.\n\nTwo main ideas have been developed in this project.\n\nTime-selective sampling:  In this approach, only small samples of the signal are retained, hence avoiding the distortion incurred when a  large signal is input to a nonlinear device.  From this limited collection of  samples, compressive sensing techniques are then used to extract the  signal of interest.  Major results of this project include: (1) Demonstrating the utility of the technique, including demonstrating the  technique is superior to alternatives such as attenuating the entire  received signal before the nonlinear device; (2) Completing the schematic design of a time-selective sampling                              receiver in a 65nm CMOS                              process; (3) Characterizing the number of samples required for performance guarantees  for compressive sensing technques when the samples of the signal of  interest to the receiver are taken in groups.  The group sampling  structure is caused by the structure of the interfering signal, which,  being the (much) larger signal, determines the sampling times.\n \nFast switch toggling:  In this approach, the signal at the front end    is first passed through a fast switch that toggles in a specific    pattern to mitigate the large interferer before it hits the nonlinear    components in the receiver.  This project has developed fast, efficient    methods for finding switch patterns that have desirable properties.\n\nGiven the importance of wideband receiver operation in the presence of interference in wireless communication devices, these technical advances have the potential to impact future commercial devices.  In addition, the project has provided a..."
