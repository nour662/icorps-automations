 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall effectiveness of numerical methods for partial differential equations may be severely limited by solutions that lack smoothness on a relatively small subset of the domain.  Problems may have singularities induced by the geometry of the domain; convection dominated regimes may result in interior or boundary layers; discontinuous material coefficients can cause sharp gradients; or solutions may blow up at interior points when operator coefficients are singular or degenerate.  This project proposes a systematic study of weighted finite element methods where standard norms and inner products are replaced with weighted norms and inner products.  In the least-squares finite element setting, these weight functions serve to redefine the metric under which the error is minimized and, as such, the relative accuracy of the numerical solution can be balanced throughout the domain in an optimal way.  For some problems, the right choice of weights can recover convergence where the analogous nonweighted case does not converge and, in other problems, convergence rates are enhanced by an appropriate set of weights.  This project will develop robust adaptive methods for a wide class of linear and nonlinear problems, where the weights are chosen from coarse scale problems within a mesh refinement strategy.\r\n\r\nThe efficient numerical solution of partial differential equations is of great importance throughout the applied sciences.  Finite element methods constitute a popular and flexible approach to solving a wide range of problems, and the development of robust, accurate, and efficient finite element algorithms is in high demand for applications including mechanics of deformable solids, fluid flow, transport, and electromagnetics.  This project aims to develop a new class of adaptive finite element methods that are motivated by the success of weighted-norm least squares methods and adaptive mesh refinement algorithms.  Robust adaptive algorithms allow for better numerical simulations by focusing computational resources on the most challenging aspects of the problem, increasing overall accuracy and decreasing computational time.  In models of glacier flow, for example, regions of the ice near the surface and the ground require more resolution than the majority of the interior ice, and accurate models must be able to allocate the computational work in an optimal way.  Successful results from this project will enhance the current understanding of how adaptive algorithms can be designed to evolve optimally from coarse scale approximations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "In this project, the investigators developed, analyzed, and implemented a new class of adaptive finite element methods for a wide class of partial differential equations (PDEs).  These equations form the fundamental backbone behind many applications including mechanics of deformable solids, fluid flow, transport, and electromagnetics.  \n This project was motivated by the principle that the solutions to complex real-world systems are generally approximated by sophisticated computational techniques, and, as such, these approximations will always contain some amount of unresolved error.  Reducing that error generally requires more computational cost, making efficient computational methods a major focus of research.  For a motivational example, imagine predicting the dynamics of blood flow through an artery.  Throughout much of the region to be simulated, the fluid will be moving in a predictable way, but near bends or junctions in the vessel the fluid will be moving in a much more complex way.  The method investigated in this project adaptively redefines the way the error is percieved so that further efforts to reduce the error will be done in a more optimal way.  So once it is known where the most challenging parts of the blood flow simulation will be, the algorithm will redefine its notion of error, from the smooth parts that are easy to simulate to the challenging parts that require more effort.  In other words, adaptive methods \"learn as they go\" in order to produce the best approximation at the lowest computational cost.\nThrough the three-year timeframe of the project, the PI worked closely with seven undergraduate student collaborators.  The students gained a view of the process of research in computational mathematics, including literature searching and critical reading, algorithm development and analysis, implementing mathematical models computationally, and working collaboratively.  Students also presented their work in research posters, presentations, and peer-reviewed publications.  At the end of the award period, two of the participants are current undergraduate students at Wabash College planning toward graduate school, two are current Ph.D. students in mathematics, two are working full-time in software development, and one is a Fulbright Fellow in Germany.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/23/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Chad Westphal"
