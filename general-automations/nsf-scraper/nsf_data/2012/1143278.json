 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR) Phase I project will utilize patent pending technology that allows direct dissolution and reconstitution of natural biopolymers to prepare chitin/alginate composite fibers with embedded additives for use in wound care products.  The technology allows for solution blending and spinning of alginate and chitin (both known to speed wound healing, stimulate cell recovery, and be antibacterial) with therapeutic additives to produce composite fibers.  This unique technology embeds the additives into the fibers during spinning, leading to slow release of the additives into the wound as the fiber absorbs water and becomes less rigid, and thus allowing the delivery of physiologically relevant doses of a therapeutic agent to the wound over an extended period of time.  These fibers will a) possess the inherent properties of the biopolymers that increase wound healing and cell recovery, b) localize delivery of beneficial additives, and c) slowly release the additives over an extended period of time.  In Phase I, the goals are to develop an understanding of the relationship between the relative chitin/alginate/additive composition and spinning conditions on mechanical and rheological properties (strength, elasticity, viscosity), water absorption, and additive release rates under simulated conditions as needed for the diabetic skin ulcer markets.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the potential to reduce the duration (by ~40%) and cost (by 20-50%) of wound care treatment by developing a unique composite fiber with additives both on the surface and evenly distributed within the fiber, thereby allowing not only for extended release of the additives, but also less frequent dressing changes and decreased healing time compared to the current spray-coated fibers.  The targeted skin ulcer treatment market is predicted to generate revenue of $7.4 billion by 2013, an increase caused by the rising diabetic population.  A subset of this market where produced fibers are most applicable, the moist dressing treatment, achieved revenue of $315.4 million in 2008 and is expected to grow to $424.8 million by 2013.  There is an urgent need for products that can improve healing rates and novel dressings incorporating innovative fibers that can be applied less frequency, last longer, and contain additives to promote healing, thus reducing patient care cost.  The successful development of these specialty fibers for the diabetic ulcer market will provide scientific insight allowing for the customized production of composite fibers for other wound care and health markets.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Chitin dressings for burns and wounds accelerate healing and reduce pain when compared to standard treatments.  The reasons for the current limitations in utilizing chitin to its full potential, are the difficulty in processing this material (due to its insolubility in aqueous and conventional organic solvents), and the energy intensive process required for its extraction from raw biomass.  Current extraction processes result in the degradation of the chitin structure, changing the properties of the biopolymer.  Therefore, chitin-containing fibers for wound healing dressings have not been previously produced due to the aforementioned limitations.\n\n525 Solutions developed chitin-alginate products for wound care market utilizing ionic liquid technology.  This technology allows for direct dissolution and reconstitution of natural biopolymers, solution blending, and spinning of alginate and chitin (both known to accelerate wound healing, stimulate cell recovery, and be antibacterial) to produce composite fibers with embedded therapeutic additives for use in wound care products.  Vitamin E is embedded into the fibers during spinning, leading to its slow release into the wound as the fiber absorbs water and becomes less rigid.\n\nThe composite fibers possess the inherent properties of the biopolymers and meet or exceed the specifications needed for medical applications.  We have established the relative chitin/alginate/additive composition and spinning conditions, as well as determined their mechanical and rheological properties (strength, elasticity), water absorption, and additive release. \n\nProducts prepared via this technology are overall better and more cost-effective than current products.  Novel dressings incorporating innovative fibers have the potential to reduce the duration and cost of wound care treatment through less frequent dressing changes and decreased healing time compared to the current surface-coated fibers. \n\nThe targeted skin ulcer treatment market is predicted to generate revenues of $7.4 billion by 2013, an increase caused by the rising diabetic population.

The ionic liquid technology could also make advances in the sustainability of the chitin industry through the repurposing of a waste product into a high-value product.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/21/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gabriela Gurau"
