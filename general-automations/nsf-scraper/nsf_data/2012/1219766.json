 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit. The timescales and volumes of magma generation, transport, and emplacement help set the thermal, structural, and geochemical architecture of the lithosphere. Structural and petrologic data, in conjunction with recent advances in high-precision geochronology have led to contrasting models that involve either large volumes of magma transported and emplaced over short timescales or small batches of magma that are emplaced incrementally over many millions of years. Modelling of magma emplacement is hampered by : a) limited exposure of complete plutonic systems, and b) incomplete understanding of timescales timescales for magma emplacement. This proposal outlines a three year project targeting both challenges in the ca. 30 Ma Bergell intrusion, located in the Central Alps in N. Italy. This pluton was chosen for the following reasons: [1] extraordinary exposure and relief in the high Alps, [2] its young age permits very high-precision geochronology (ca. \u00b110-20 ka on single zircon fragments), [3] it exhibits a range in lithologies from gabbroic to granodioritic with archetypal normal zoning, and [4] an ~12-15 vertical km crustal cross section has been exposed through post-emplacement Alpine uplift and tilting.   Based primarily on structural and field data, emplacement of the Bergell pluton is inferred to have been prolonged (ca. 5 Ma) with mid-crustal magma residence followed by diapirism/ballooning into the upper crust. This model is in stark contrast to recent incremental intrusion models for middle and upper crustal plutons and demands corroborating geochronology of samples with well-characterized field relations. The goal of this study is to construct a robust 4D model for pluton construction based on detailed field work and high-precision geochronology of carefully selected samples spanning the feeder zone to the roof. Initial work described in this proposal summarizes field work in the Bergell and presents a novel analytical approach combining zircon geochronology with in situ and bulk mineral trace element analyses on dated zircon fragments. Accessory mineral geochemistry will aid interpretations of high-precision geochronology by identifying xeno- and antecrysts and be used to detail potential magmatic differentiation trends, which place timescales on AFC processes and evaluate the degree to which magmatic intrusions remained closed systems. Integration of whole-rock major/trace element data will be used to decipher the size and frequency of magma pulses. Finally, this information will be used to develop numerical models of magma emplacement and evolution, and its implications for rheological characteristics of middle and upper crust. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts. This work will train one PhD student (Kyle Samperton) and at least two senior Under graduates (Christine Chen ?13 in year 1) in a diverse set of tools including field geology, structural geology, and igneous petrology, and to supplement these skills with experience using cutting edge geochemical and isotopic analytical methods. This work involves training in one other laboratory (Prof. John Cottle?s LA-ICPMS lab at Univ. California Santa Barbara) and also in numerical techniques through collaboration with Dr. Catherine Annen (Univ. Bristol). The project will provide support for newly established analytical facilities at Princeton as well as the PI?s participation in the NSF-supported EARTHTIME initiative. The project links with a multi-university Swiss initiative to study the Adamello batholith, located ~100 km SE of the proposed field locale. The Adamello batholith is a classic locality for studies of magmatic processes but, significantly, lacks the vertical resolution through the crust provided by the Bergell intrusion. The PI has served as an external expert for that project and will organize a joint field symposia involving swiss PhD students and collaborators in summer 2013 in order to share the results of both projects.",

This involves camping and field mapping in rugged alpine terrain and taking structural data and rock samples; it was done by 2-5 people including the PI Schoene, and his graduate and undergraduate students.

So the early work, carried out by Princeton graduate student Kyle Samperton, was targeted at understanding the growth of those minerals by using various tools for measuring geochemical variation within single minerals and connecting that information with dates; this gives an estimate of how the composition and temperature of the magma was changing through time.  That information can be used to say where magma was present within the system and also the temperature through the system as a function of time.  Such data can be used in conjunction with the geochemistry of the entire rock to model the crystallization history of the samples, and therefore how crystalline the nascent pluton was through time.  These data are consistent with the pluton having been built incrementally by the addition of small batches of magma generated in the lower crust, but also track how those batches amalgamated and grew into larger bodies.

One paper on this part of the project is published (Samperton et al., 2015), and one is currently in review at Geology.\n\n            An important question related to the evolution of magmas and mountain belts concerns the relationship between deformation of the crust and the transport of magma.  The Bergell pluton has featured prominently in this debate in that it was a locus of study in the 1980s and 1990s, whereby models linking magmatism and deformation were established.  We aimed to test and refine these models by carrying out geochronology in connection with old and new observations about the structural geology and deformation history of the pluton. By using estimates from the first part of the project outlined above that constrain the distribution of liquid through time in the pluton, and combining this with detailed field observation, we have placed time constraints on deformation within the magmatic system through time.  The conclusion is that contraction, or squeezing, in the molten portions at the bottom of the magmatic system forced liquid upwards in the system, causing stress in the upper crust and \"ballooning\" in the roof of the pluton.  This model is consistent with previous structural work and also bridges models for incremental assembly of plutonic bodies and models that involve transfer en masse of magma through the middle crust.  This project also has implications for the mechanics of magma transfer and the availability of magma for volcanic and hydrothermal systems.  These latter findings are currently being written into two papers that should be submitted in early 2017.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Blair Schoene"
