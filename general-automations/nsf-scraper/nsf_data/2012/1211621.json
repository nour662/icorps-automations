The collaborative component of the project will bring together photometry and spectroscopy expertise so that the investigators can address the mystery of anomalous Li abundances, which may indicate that additional, as yet unknown, physical mechanisms act in stars. Both PI?s have institutional access to appropriate observatories (WIYN and Mt. Laguna). The work will have broader impacts to Galactic evolution and cosmology, and the PI?s will train undergraduate and graduate students in research at two universities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEvery star-forming galaxy resembles an ecosystem in which the individual \"organisms\" (stars) form and evolve, producing heavier elements in their interiors and &ndash; maybe &ndash; sharing the products of their interior nucleosynthesis with the larger environment of the Galaxy.  Thus, while larger forces may shape the Universe?s most basic characteristics and its future, a galaxy?s chemical evolution is driven by the lives of its stars.  We understand the basic thread of those life stories:  a star?s structure and stable lifetime are largely dictated by the amount of gas it starts with.  The privilege that we?ve shared with other astronomers is to add incremental detail to that story line by seeking answers to questions like:  How much difference does it make if the star formed along with planets?  How do stars spin down, and what are the effects on their interior structures?  To what extent is it possible for a star?s surface to reflect the chemical composition of its deepest layers? \n\nTo make headway on some of these questions, we?ve chosen to specialize in the interpretation of a particular type of observation, stars? surface Lithium abundances.  Learning that piece of information about a star involves spreading out the light of a faint stars as a function of wavelength: stellar spectroscopy.  Interpretation of those spectra requires us to know a fair amount about each star: its surface temperature and surface gravity, as well as its probable overall chemical composition.  Knowing these basic characteristics is a lot easier if we observe large ensembles of stars with common origin, age and chemical characteristics &ndash; stars in open or globular clusters. \n\nObservations of Lithium in star clusters have challenged the status quo of our theories about stellar structure and evolution.   We know that Lithium is destroyed by nuclear reactions at temperatures of a few million degrees Kelvin, a temperature reached in the sun about 2/3 of the way out from the center.  Stars appear to slowly erode Li by mixing surface layer gas to greater and hotter depths, to a larger extent than predicted by our standard picture.  Stars hotter and more massive than the sun, which apparently lack even the basic surface mixing mechanism that we see in the sun?s outer convective layers, show a stunning and unexplained depletion of Lithium over a narrow range of Temperature, a feature that develops in stars older than 100 million years and persists.  Our investigations have added details to our knowledge of this interesting phenomenon by exploring the Lithium dip feature in several star clusters covering a range in age and chemical composition.   We are beginning to see a strong connection between a star?s ability to preserve Li in its outer layers and its rotational evolution and spin-down over time. We?ve also found several examples in star clusters of stars that somehow produce Lithium rather than deplete or deteriorate it, as is the common path for most stars. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barbara J Anthony-Twarog"
