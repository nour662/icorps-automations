 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators plan to significantly improve measurements of stellar temperatures and radii using optical interferometry of 425 giant stars, whose distances are accurately determined from a recent reanalysis of the Hipparcos dataset. Through direct measurements of effective temperature, linear radius and limb darkening, models that indirectly predict such values will be calibrated. They will use angular size data from the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) and Navy Optical Interferometer (NOI) in conjunction with spectrophotometry to directly determine temperature, radius, and stellar structure for the giant stars at unprecedented levels of accuracy.  Optical and nearinfrared data will be used to constrain the bolometric fluxes, which in combination with PTI angular diameters will provide direct measures of temperature. \r\n\r\nThis work will have broader impacts to many fields of stellar astrophysics, including structure, modeling, evolution, galactic spectral synthesis, exoplanetary science and planet/star formation theory.  They will also participate in a public outreach program with Lowell Observatory.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe intent of this project was to utilize the large body of measured stellar apparent sizes that had been collected in the archive of the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI).  PTI was a NASA telescope that operated on Palomar Mountain between 1996 and 2008, observing star sizes at milliarcsecond scales - roughly 1000 times finer than what conventional telescopes can resolve.  \nThe stars that were observed for this study are 'giant' stars - objects that are similar in mass to our sun, but older and more evolved.  Stars at these advanced ages puff up in size by 10 to 100 times.  Investigating these objects in detail inform us about the eventual end-of-life for our own star, the sun, and also tell us about the nature of the brightest objects in the sky.  Direct measures of apparent stellar size from PTI allow for empirical establishment of the fundamental parameters of these stars.\nThese sizes, combined with measurements of stellar brightness, were used to refine our knowledge of the temperatures of stars.  The stellar brightness measurements were made at a variety of specific colors for these stars, and a subsequent analysis allowed us to infer the missing brightness measures between the measured colors.  An extra complication on these brightness measures that required the use of substantial amounts of computer time was adding into the analysis an estimate of the dimming by interstellar dust between a given star and the Earth.  Correcting for this dimming allowed us to robustly estimate the overall stellar brightness.  When combined with the apparent size of the star as measured by PTI, a direct measurement of the stellar temperature could be made.\nStellar temperatures are often indirectly measured by astronomers, through the use of techniques that involve stellar models.  However, calibration of those models through direct measurements is a necessary prior to these techniques.  The results of this study refine the constraints upon those models by a factor of 4 relative to previous work.  \nIn addition to temperatures, stellar apparent sizes can be used in conjunction with distance estimates to establish the linear sizes of these stars.  Distances have historically been notoriously hard to estimate, but in the next year a new release of diameters from the European Gaia satellite will allow these results to improve the knowledge of stellar linear sizes by a similar factor.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gerard Van Belle"
