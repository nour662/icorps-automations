 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I\r\nproject will develop a long lasting organic formulation to effectively manage and\r\nsuppress populations of mosquito vectors of disease. The banning of DDT and\r\nother persistent mosquito larvicides several decades ago has created a major gap\r\nin vector management that has yet to be effectively filled by generations of\r\nenvironmentally friendly chemicals and formulations that followed. The\r\nconsequences are tangible to the human population worldwide. We are currently\r\nexperiencing more pain, suffering, and deaths from mosquito transmitted\r\ndiseases than when DDT was available. Biological larvicidal formulations have\r\nbeen proven safe and effective in controlling mosquito larvae, with the caveat\r\nthat they have a very short field life which requires frequent reapplications to\r\nsustain control, in turn making them too expensive for adoption by most areawide\r\nvector control programs. Because of this, biological larvicidal formulations\r\nare seldom used preventatively. This SBIR project will bridge this gap and\r\nincrease the longevity, and usability, of biological larvicides. Success will result in\r\ndirect mitigation of soil and waterways pollution commonly associated with\r\nconventional pesticides for mosquito control.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are, if\r\nthis SBIR project is successful, the development of a biological, long lasting\r\nlarvicidal formulation that will significantly change the way parasitic mosquitoes\r\nare managed worldwide, making it much more effective, reducing disease and\r\nsuffering, and saving lives while significantly reducing non-target effects and\r\nenvironmental pollution. This is a worldwide market opportunity of over\r\n$2B/year.",
