 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth of the microprocessor industry has led to progress in diversified computing applications, such as health care, education, security, and communications.   However, energy consumption has emerged as a barrier to the continued success of the American semiconductor industry.  The inability to scale chip voltages at the historic rate has created a difficult design dilemma referred to as dark silicon: more transistors can fit on a chip, but a growing fraction will not be able to be used due to power dissipation limits.  To scale performance in this landscape, fundamental increases in the computational efficiency of processors is required to get much more performance for much less energy. To scale computational efficiency, this work develops an architectural approach referred to as Composite Cores. The proposed architecture brings the notion of heterogeneity from between different cores in a processor to within a core.  \r\n\r\nEach composite core will consist of several energy efficient engines that have been customized to particular execution scenarios found in general-purpose applications.  A dynamic management system will perform fine-grain mapping of application segments to the most efficient engine.  Hardware mechanisms to ensure delay-free migration of program state provide smooth transitions from engine to engine.  By dynamically partitioning an application across a set of customized engines, a large portion of the efficiency gains afforded by hardware accelerators on regular codes can be realized on general-purpose applications. The broader impact of this work is that green computing is recognized as one of the most important challenges in the semiconductor industry and more broadly in Computer Science.  Composite cores enable general-purpose processors to reach new levels of energy efficiency while not sacrificing the ability to execute arbitrary code.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on developing new microprocessor designs that enable scaling performance without requiring more energy consumption.  High energy consumption has emerged as a barrier to the continued success of the American semiconductor industry resulting in a difficult design dilemma: more transistors can fit on a chip, but a growing fraction will not be able to be used due to cooling limitations.  To scale performance in this landscape, fundamental increases in the computational efficiency of microprocessors are required to get much more performance for much less energy.  This design paradox has traditionally pushed engineers to employ specialized accelerators.   But, when specialized accelerators are used for general purpose applications (e.g., operating systems, word processors, Web browsers, utilities, etc.), they generally fail because such applications cannot be effectively mapped onto accelerators.\n\nOne of the key outcomes of this project is overcoming the limitations of hardwired accelerators through the development of a new processor architecture referred to as Composite Cores.   A composite core enables engineers to extract the efficiency gains of specialization, but in the context of a general-purpose microprocessor, and hence applicable to any application.  The key insight is that general-purpose programs, while irregular at the macro level, contain short periods of highly regular behavior that can be executed more efficiently on specialized engines.  By dynamically partitioning an application across a set of customized engines contained within a microprocessor, a large portion of the computational efficiency gains afforded by hardware accelerators on regular codes can be realized on general-purpose applications.  This project initially developed a method to switch between specialized engines at the granularity of 1000 instructions, which represents a four order of magnitude improvement over traditional designs that switched at 10 million instructions.  Subsequent designs created composite cores that could switch at hundreds of instructions and finally 50 instructions.  Another key outcome of this project is the development of a processor organization referred to as Dynamos.  Dynamos enables simple in-order cores that are used in mobile environments to execute code schedules generated by energy-rich cores that are used in desktop and server systems.  As a result, Dynamos cores can achieve the high performance of a desktop system but on the energy budget of a mobile system.\n\nThe outcomes of this project that have broader impact include several notable items.  First, the project supported two students obtaining their PhD degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan, including one female student.  The project partially supported several other students including another female student who got her MS degree.  Second, the composite core technology was transferred to industry, specifically ARM Limited.  ARM designs microprocessors for a variety of energy-constrained settings including mobile phones and tablets, thus they are well positioned to productize the technology.   Finally, the research was disseminated to the broader community through numerous conference/journal publications, seminars presented at universities and industrial research labs, and the creation of a Composite Cores website to facilitate further research by the broader community.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott Mahlke"
