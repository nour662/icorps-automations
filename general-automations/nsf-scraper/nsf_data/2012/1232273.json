 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to investigate the soliton dynamics in mid-infrared quantum-cascade lasers. The soliton effect originates in the cancellation between the group velocity dispersion and self-phase modulation.  Such effect may play a key role in the generation of ultra-short pulses by mid-infrared quantum-cascade lasers, which are important to major applications such as biomedical sensing and environmental control. The elucidation of the underlying physics may therefore enable a new class of compact ultrafast lasers in the mid-infrared region since group velocity dispersion and self-phase modulation are simultaneously present in the same structure and are both associated with the intersubband transitions in quantum-cascade lasers.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is that the proposed research will make significant contributions to the understanding of ultrafast dynamics in quantum cascade lasers. Such devices are of intense interest for mid-infrared and far-infrared continuous-wave as well as for short-pulsed sources. The transformative of this research is that results from the investigation could be applied to design a new type of quantum cascade laser medium yielding shortened mid-infrared pulses through bandgap engineering.  The design will be pursued through the collaboration with an experimental group.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are in providing excellent multidisciplinary training in the area of nanophotonics within a research environment. Two Master?s students are expected to participate in this research. This program will also provide training opportunities for local K-12 teachers and high-school students through workshops. The results from the proposed research will be published in the scientific and engineering literature and presented at conferences.",
