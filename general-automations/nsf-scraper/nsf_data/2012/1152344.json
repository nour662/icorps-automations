This project uses coarse graining as the starting point to develop multi-resolution protein models, which are combined with a theoretically robust framework involving a supersymmetric generalization of the Fokker-Planck diffusion equation, and a mathematically rigorous definition of collective variables. These methods are applied to rapidly locate rare event regions in molecular dynamics landscapes, and give a robust foundation for benchmarking and creating new models of complex systems. The developed methodology is used to characterize the functional aspects of protein dynamics on timescales out of reach to conventional approaches.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are in the biological sciences.    Prof. Clementi is involved with the development of courses in computational molecular biology and an outreach program involving presentations to local schools.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Molecular Biophysics program in Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology.",

All-atom simulations provide fine-detail information (ca. 1 nm) up to a few 100 microseconds timescale. Our work allows to define multiscale models to bridge the gap between these techniques to target an intermediate resolution (ca. 0.5-20 nm) over a broad range of timescales (ns to s), providing crucial components in the understanding of biological processes. We have created a suite of programs that allows us to simulate proteins at different resolutions, spanning from models representing a residue by a single &ldquo;bead&rdquo; centered on the Carbon-   &alpha;   atom, to higher resolution models that include all atomic coordinates. Different forms for the effective interaction potentials can be used for each resolution. Previous models proposed by our group and others have been included in our repertoire (e.g., the DMC model, see PNAS 29, 10141 (2005), and the AWSEM-MD model, see J. Phys. Chem. B 116, 8494 (2012)).
