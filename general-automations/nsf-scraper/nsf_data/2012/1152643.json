The \"4CESM\" meeting will be held over 5 days in the summer of 2012 and will enable the interdisciplinary exchange of information and ideas concerning recent advances in measurement, theory, and numerical modeling in the solar and space physics communities. \r\n\r\nThe \"4CESM\" meeting will provide a forum for interdisciplinary scientists to discuss their research about the current state of our understanding of the Sun's extreme minimum activity between solar cycles 23 and 24, as well as the potential effects of this minmum activity on the Earth. This unusual solar minimum provides a unique opportunity to assess the nature and structure of a very quiet Sun and a terrestrial upper atmosphere relatively devoid of solar influences. The overarching challenge for solar physics is to explain why this minimum happened, to determine how unusual it actually was, and to discover what the ramifications might be for future solar activity and the strength of the solar cycle on longer time scales.  \r\n\r\nThe funding provided by the National Science Foundation will allow 10 to 12 outstanding graduate students and young scientists to attend the \"4CESM\" meeting. Additonal community impact will be assured through AGU publication of the Chapman Conference proceedings, publication of selected conference papers in the AGU's \"Journal of Geophysical Research (Space Physics),\" and a summary report in the AGU publication \"Eos.\"",
