The OSDI  '12 program included 26 technical papers, carefully selected by refereed  committee from over 295 submissions, in addition to a keynote, and a  poster session.  The papers represent some of the outstanding work in  the area, with topics including big data, distributed systems and  networking, security, virtualization and mobility.  The conference was  held in Hollywood, CA on October 8-10, 2012.  USENIX believes in open  access to research, and all the OSDI '12 technical session content  (print and video) is open and viewable by the public on the web site.\n\n \nMajor Activities: The USENIX Association offers stipends to most conferences we host.   Any student enrolled full-time at an accredited university or college  is welcome to apply for a stipend.  Stipends have two components:  registration costs and expenses.  For those students selected, USENIX  covers the registration costs by providing students with a complimentary  registration code.  For the expense portion, USENIX provides a check to  assist the student with costs related to airfare and hotel.  Variations  in the amount of offers depends on how far a student will need to  travel and the amount they request (i.e., some students may stay with a  friend in the town of the conference, and therefore, do not need the  hotel expense).  We confirm that the students register and attend the  event.  We do not require that students provide us with a detailed  accounting of how the funds were spent.\n \n\nStudents who are participating in the conference, e.g., presenting a poster\nStudents whose areas of study significantly overlap with the  conference topics and who write a concise essay (supporting statement)  outlining their research\nFirst-time applicants and those who have not received a stipend in the past 12 months\nStudents who are willing to volunteer at the conference (this  generally consists of writing a summary of technical session(s) for  ;login:, the USENIX journal)\nStudents from institutions not traditionally represented at USENIX events\nStudent members of the Association (not required)\nClass level and financial need\n\n\nSpecific Objectives: USENIX received 162 stipend applications from students, and 131 were  awarded grants.  Some of the funds were covered by the $20,000 from the  NSF.  All students attend US based schools.  USENIX appreciates the  financial support of the NSF, which allowed us to grant awards to many  more qualified applicants than we would have been able to otherwise.   There were 520 total attendees at OSDI '12, with 497 attending the OSDI  Technical Sessions and 23 on site for the workshops only.  Non-US  attendees came from: Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France,  Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands,  Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.\n\n Significant Results: Participation in OSDI '12 and similar conferences is a valuable and  important part of the graduate school experience.  It provides students  with the opportunity to interact with senior researchers in their field  from both academia and industry, and exposes them to leading edge  research. USENIX encourages mentoring opportunities, and asks students  to volunteer as a means to increase their involvement and meaningful  interactions.  Students are encourages to present posters of their  research, and to act as scribes for the sessions.  The support requested  in this grant enabled the participation of students who would otherwise  have been unable to attend.\nJournal Publication:  OSDI 2012 (2013). 10th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI \u00c612).  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t;login:. 38 (1).\nWebsite:  https://www.usenix..."
