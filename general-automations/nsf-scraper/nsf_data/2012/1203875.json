The conference has never before been hosted at WWU, a location relatively accessible for Athabaskan communities in British Columbia, Alberta, Yukon, Alaska, and northern California. The ALC serves as the principal gathering of linguists, educators, language planners, and community members working with Athabaskan languages.  It is a key event in fostering long-term collaboration between Athabaskanists working on theoretical linguistics and language documentation, on the one hand, and linguists and community activists involved in developing or fostering language revitalization programs, on the other.",

The conference was co-organized by Edward Vajda (Western Washington University Dept. of Modern and Classical Languages) and Sharon Hargus (University of Washington Dept. of Linguistics).  Major funding for the conference was provided by a grant from the National Science Foundation (Arctic Social Sciences Program). \n\n         Meeting nearly annually since 1980, the conference has had the goal of advancing the study and preservation of the languages of the Athabaskan or Dene family.  The 2012 conference included presentations on structural aspects of the languages by linguists, as well as presentations on language pedagogy by language teachers from some of the communities where the languages of the family are spoken, including Cold Lake AB (Denes??in&eacute; language), Moricetown BC (Witsuwit\u00c6en language), and Rae NWT (Tl?ch? language).

Athapasca was first bestowed on the family by Gallatin 1836.  Variant spellings are Athabaskan, Athabascan (preferred in Alaska), and Athapaskan (preferred in Canada).  The term Dene is a generalized form of the word for \"person, man\", which occurs in a similar form in most of the languages of the family; e.g. Dakelh (Carrier) dune, Navajo din&eacute;, Gwich\u00c6in dinjii.  This term also made its first appearance in the 19th century (e.g. Petitot 1876).  The conference has historically been called the Athabaskan Languages Conference, using the generally accepted term among linguists, but for some years at this conference, many community members, particularly those from Canadian communities, have expressed a preference that the language family be referred to as Dene rather than Athabaskan.  The issue came to a head at the 2012 conference, and at the business meeting on Aug. 16, participants voted unanimously to change the name of future meetings to the Dene Languages Conference.\n\n       The proceedings of the 2012 conference were published by the Alaska Native Language Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks, in May 2013, and made available at the June 2013 meeting of the Dene Languages Conference, hosted by the Tsuut'ina First Nation (near Calgary, Alberta, Canada).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/13/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward J Vajda"
