The topic is significant for human health (covering, for example, aspects of bone and tooth diseases) as well as for engineering science by providing models for bioinspired engineering.  The conference has been designed to maximize interactions that can serve to enlighten participants from diverse backgrounds and foster new, interdisciplinary collaborations.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  The conference brings together a broad spectrum of scientists with interests in biomineralization, who work at the interfaces of biology, geochemistry, materials science, osteochondral physiology, and regenerative medicine.  The conjoined Gordon Research Seminar will enable 50 students and young career researchers to present their work and hold fruitful discussions immediately prior to the GRC.  Support for participant attendance will be provided with appropriate attention to the NSF priority of broadening participation.",
