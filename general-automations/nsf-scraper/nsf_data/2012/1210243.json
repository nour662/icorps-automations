 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Matthew Campbell of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks to conduct a research project during the summer of 2012.  The research address the question: \"Did flatfish evolve more than once?\"  The host scientist is Dr. Wei-Jen Chen of the Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit lies in the investigation of the apparent contradiction of information from anatomical and molecular studies. In classification schemes, the flatfish (Pleuronectiformes) are all considered to have evolved from a common ancestor.  That is, all living species of flatfish are descendants from a single lineage that evolved a compressed body design.  This idea of flatfish monophyly is supported by the physical form of flatfish, however molecular studies indicate that flatfish likely evolved more than once.  Some flatfish appear to be more closely related to non-flatfish than to other flatfish. The research is identifying evolutionary origins and relationships of flatfish.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship includes a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
