The XVIIth ICMP will be held 6-11 August 2012 in Aalborg, Denmark. This project will fund ICMP participation for approximately 15 young mathematical physics researchers from institutions in the US working in various areas of mathematical physics, from quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, to string theory. In addition, the supported participants will attend the Young Researchers Symposium 3-4 August 2011 in Aalborg before the ICMP.\r\nThe ICMP is the main meeting of mathematical physicists from around the world. The primary speakers present work on the cutting-edge of the various fields of mathematical physics. This is an outstanding opportunity for young research at US institutions to meet these renowned mathematicians and to learn about recent advances. The topical programs allow the participants to focus on the subfield of their interests and learn about recent work. In addition to the ICMP, the Young Researcher Symposium will allow the recipients to present their own work and to interact more closely with leaders in the field.\r\nThe selection committee will choose the grant recipients based on their research achievements and promise. The committee will strive to ensure that participation in the ICMP will greatly contribute to the professional development of the applicant. The availability of these travel grants will be posted on the AMS, AWM, and ICMP web sites, and it will be electronically distributed to mathematical physicists, both mathematicians and physicists, throughout the US.",
