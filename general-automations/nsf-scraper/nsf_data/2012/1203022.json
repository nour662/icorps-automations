 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program focuses on trapping and cooling atomic hydrogen in a simple room-temperature apparatus.   Molecular hydrogen is mixed with an inert carrier gas and expanded in the flow of a pulsed supersonic beam.  The molecules will be dissociated near the output of the valve.  Atomic hydrogen will be stopped with a timed series of pulsed electromagnetic coils, relying on the magnetic moment of hydrogen.  This atomic coilgun will be optimized for the case of hydrogen, and an adiabatic coilgun will be constructed in order to enable mode matching to the source.  The stopped atoms will be confined in a magnetic trap in a room temperature apparatus, and will be detected using the two-photon 1S-2S transition near 243 nm.  Hydrogen will be cooled to near the recoil temperature by single-photon cooling, in a dressed RF magnetic trap.    \r\n\r\nAtomic hydrogen is the simplest element in the periodic table, yet it has proven extremely challenging to control its translational motion.  The standard method of laser cooling has not been possible, due to the lack of an accessible cycling transition.  This research program will demonstrate trapping and cooling of hydrogen in a simple room temperature apparatus, using new methods that were successfully applied to other atoms.  The broader significance of this work is that it will enable in the future the trapping and cooling of atomic tritium.  This is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, and its study can provide important data for nuclear physics.  The same techniques can also be applied to anti-hydrogen, and such studies can test basic symmetries between matter and anti-matter.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAtomic hydrogen has served as a fundamental testing ground in physics for the past century.  Future advances with hydrogen and its isotopes will require cooling toward the absolute zero.  To date, it has been extremely challenging to trap and cool hydrogen, as it is not amenable to direct laser cooling.  The intellectual merits of the project are that we have developed new methods for cooling atoms that will include hydrogen isotopes.  These methods provide an alternative to laser cooling, with much better predicted performance in terms of generality, flux of ultra-cold atoms per second, and atomic density.  During the past grant cycle we continued our development of these general methods, starting from efficient entrainment of atoms in the flow of a supersonic beam of a carrier gas.  Atoms are stopped using a series of pulsed magnetic coils, an arrangement that we call an atomic coilgun. Our efforts have been focused on atomic lithium, which will be co-trapped with hydrogen, allowing further cooling by evaporation of the lithium which cools the hydrogen by collisions.  Our results to date, still unpublished, are a factor of 1000x better than laser cooling in terms of flux of atoms.  These results are now being optimized further.  In parallel, a supersonic beam of atomic hydrogen in a helium carrier gas is created in a gas discharge, so that a mixture of hydrogen and lithium will be trapped.\n\nThe broader impacts of the project are that room temperature trapping and cooling of hydrogen will create a new testing ground for fundamental physics.  The measurement of three-body association is a key parameter for understanding early star formation in the universe, so it will have an important impact on astrophysics.  This apparatus will serve as a mirror machine for precision measurements of anti-hydrogen.  A calculation is in progress to show whether lithium could also be used to cool anti-hydrogen.  The current work will serve as the foundation for trapping and cooling of atomic tritium which will enable precision measurement of the triton charge radius, important for nuclear physics.  This work will also enable development of new sources of tritium for the study of beta decay, toward a determination of the neutrino rest mass.  This research program provides excellent training for students, and offers opportunities for underrepresented minorities.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/06/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark G Raizen"
