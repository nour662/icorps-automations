 "awd_abstract_narration": "Squid are often referred to as keystone species because of their central role in ocean ecosystems. They play vital roles in marine food webs both as prey for many of top predators such as seabirds, dolphins, sharks, and tunas, and as voracious predators of smaller, often deep-water (mesopelagic) fishes and invertebrates.  Squid comprise a substantial fisheries resource, both directly as commercial and recreational fisheries, and indirectly as an important food source for many of the fishes consumed by a growing human population. Changes in squid abundances can dramatically impact the ecology of the ocean and fisheries yields.   \r\nDespite the importance of squid to both ecosystems and economies, there has been little investigation of the effects of ocean acidification (OA) on these taxa. Impacts upon juvenile squid are a primary concern because: (i) early developmental stage animals are highly sensitive to environmental conditions and (ii) their successful early life history growth, behavior and survival are critical to founding future cohorts that support ecosystem food webs and global fisheries. The goal of this work is to quantify how OA conditions impact squid embryo and juvenile development, behavior, and survival. The studies will provide a mechanistic foundation for understanding potential impacts of OA on squid populations. Squid are dynamic organisms, which may now encounter high carbon dioxide and lower pH in areas of ocean upwelling, and measures of these environmental variables will be collected in this study. This research takes an extensive whole-organism approach to understanding OA impacts on squid by examining anatomy, physiology, and behavior of these animals at levels of environmental carbon dioxide and pH encompassing present-day and predicted, future values. \r\nThese are the first tests to comprehensively examine OA impacts on squid. The experiments are timely in the context of changing ocean conditions, increased pressure on squid fisheries, and preliminary data showing potential OA impacts on squid.  Understanding these effects will aid fisheries managers in estimating ecosystem and economic impacts in this and other cephalopod species. Information from this research will be used to engage and educate the general public, who are fascinated by squid biology, about ocean acidification through a summer seminar series at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The research team and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Communications Department will communicate findings from this study to journalists; interact with teachers about this work through existing fellowship programs; construct and convey education materials for grade-school children at a local science school; and develop a squid dissection module for high school teachers entitled \"Squid have ears too!\"",

Acidification, being a combined process of increasing CO&shy;<sub>2</sub> and decreasing pH has the potential to affect organismal function through multiple eco-physiological mechanisms. Early life stages are a crucial starting point to investigate the impacts of ocean acidification as young animals are the foundation of future populations, and they are often particularly susceptible to environmental changes. Squid play a major role in many marine ecosystems. They are both predators and prey for a variety of animals (dolphins, whales, seabirds, tunas) across the food web. Many squid species constitute or support productive fisheries and are thought to make up one-fifth of all global fisheries landings and values. While ocean acidification is poised to substantially impact a diverse array of marine organisms, there is little understanding of if or how decreasing pH and higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub> may impact squid, much less their eggs and young.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The goal of this work was to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying how ocean acidification conditions impacted squid embryonic and larval development, behavior, metabolism and survival, as well as address the mechanisms that potentially induce these changes.

These developmental and physiological effects could alter squid paralarvae behavior and survival in the wild, directly and indirectly impacting marine food webs and commercial fisheries.</p>\n<p>Despite these changes, we found some indication that these squid may be resilient to environmental changes. For example, we measured the changes in oxygen and pH adjacent to and within normally-developing squid (<em>Doryteuthis pealeii</em>) egg capsules, structures that house hundreds of respiring embryos. The capsules contained extremely low internal pH and near-anoxic (oxygen-deprived) oxygen concentrations. While early-stage egg capsules had pH and oxygen levels significantly lower than the surrounding seawater, late-stage capsules dropped dramatically to levels considered metabolically stressful even for adults. This suggests squid may be adapted to these &lsquo;harsh&rsquo; conditions, although they may already be near their energetic limit. Yet, natural water flow-enhanced gas and chemical exchange across the physical boundary layer surrounding the egg capsules may function to alleviate these stressful intracapsular conditions. While squid may be adapted to these stressful, natural conditions, further climate change could place young, keystone squid outside of their physiological limits. Our current analyses aim to explore this potential natural resistance to environmental stressors in the early life stages of this species and their physiological limits.</p>\n<p>As part of this effort two graduate students and eight undergraduates or recent-college-graduates were involved and trained (including 3 underrepresented minorities). One student received his Masters of Science with this research and is continuing on with his PhD. Two high-school students were involved as part of their science fair project. Two videos were created to highlight the research addressed; one aired on Canadian public television, one online. We communicated these results in more than a dozen presentations, four scientific publications, with another submitted and several more in preparation.
