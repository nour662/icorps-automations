 "awd_abstract_narration": "The neural crest is a population of migratory stem cells that contributes extensively to development of many of the structures that define vertebrates, including the jaw.  Because the neural crest is important both in vertebrate development and in vertebrate evolutionary origins it has been the subject of intense study for decades.  It is now well accepted that a cascading network of regulatory molecules collectively known as the neural-crest gene regulatory network commits progenitor cells to the neural-crest fate, and that disruption of this network grossly perturbs development of the animal. It is known that multiple transcription factors and chromatin-modifying proteins, which are two categories of genetic regulatory molecule, contribute to the network.  However, the specific interactions among these regulatory molecules remain poorly understood.\r\n\r\nThis question will be tackled using genetic approaches in zebrafish embryos.  Embryonic development in zebrafish, as all vertebrates, depends on the neural crest.  Zebrafish embryos develop externally of the mother and are transparent.  These features make them particularly well suited to investigations of mechanisms of embryonic development shared by all vertebrates.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this work, an understanding of how each of these regulatory molecules fits within the neural crest gene regulatory network will be gained, as well as knowledge of the order of function of each protein and of the nature of the regulatory interactions, i.e. activating or inhibiting, to which they contribute.  An understanding of how a transcription factor that is required in multiple cell types is directed to neural-crest specific targets by a chromatin-modifying protein should also be advanced. The potential impact of this work is a profoundly improved understanding of the genetic mechanisms governing neural crest development and vertebrate evolutionary origins. This work will provide training in cutting-edge molecular genetic methods for students from under represented minorities, and includes outreach at local public schools.",

Previously it had been shown that several transcription factors &ndash; proteins that act directly on genes to contol their expression &ndash; together with various other regulatory molecules, are necessary for normal emergence of neural crest at the neural plate border (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">overall objective</span> of the funded study was to identify all of the proteins and genetic components of the transcriptional gene regulatory network (GRN) governing formation of neural crest cells. We <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">hypothesize</span> that this GRN is composed of both transcription factors (proteins) and control regions (known as enhancer and promoter elements) of the genes with which they interact. In an earlier study, we had shown that reducing the expression of two members of the &ldquo;AP-2&rdquo; family of transcription factors, Tfap2a and Tfap2c, led to complete elimination of the neural crest. For our current project, we acquired <em>tfap2a/c</em> double mutants which exhibit precisely the same defects, as expected (Figure 2). We took advantage of this unusually clear defect (few other genetic manipulations so thoroughly remove neural crest) to address several questions relevant to understanding this GRN.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our experiments in the NSF grant focused on identifying elements of the above-described GRN &ndash; both those that act before genes of the AP-2 family, and those that act afterward (i.e., upstream and downstream of Tfap2 genes). Toward the first goal, we have identified two chromatin elements adjacent to the <em>tfap2a</em> gene that drive expression of a reporter gene in the neural crest, signifying they are likely to be enhancers that drive expression of <em>tfap2a</em> in neural crest (Figure 3). In the coming year (under separate funding) we will identify key sites within these enhancers to which transcription factors bind, and test whether these enhancers are required for the developoment of neural crest (by damaging the elements and testing the effects on zebrafish development). To study components of the neural crest GRN acting downstream of AP-2, we have created gene expression profiles of normal embryos and in embryos defective for <em>tfap2a and tfap2c</em>, at the stage shortly after neural crest should have been produced. This analysis revealed about 90 genes that require AP-2 for their expression and that encode transcription factors or other proteins that contribute to the regulation of cell types. 23 such genes are also on a list of genes expressed in neural crest, including sox10. An expression profile of sox10 mutants at the same stage revealed a much shorter list of Sox10-dependent genes expressed in neural crest.&nbsp; Under separate funding, we will use a technology that enables us to monitor all 90 genes simultaneously (nNanoString) in embryos that mutant for additional genes encoding AP-2 dependent transcription factors, thereby revealing the hierarchy of the GRN (Figure 4). Also related to the GRN downstream of AP-2, we have identified DNA stretches that are primed for binding by transcription factors (so-called open-chromatin elements), and have compared these in normal embryos and embryos mutant for both <em>tfap2a and tfac2c</em>; nearly 500 such elements were found to be open in the normal embryos but closed in the mutants. These &ldquo;AP-2 dependent&rdquo; open chromatin elements are likely to be regulated by AP-2, and those adjacent to genes expressed in neural crest may be AP-2 dependent, neural crest enhancers. Thus far we have tested one such element in transgenic zebrafish and discovered that this prediction was correct.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">intellectual merit</span> of this project is that it has advanced the field&rsquo;s understanding of vertebrate developmental genetics by revealing some of the gene regulatory network that governs the specification of neural crest cells, which serve as a model for other precursor cell types in the embryo.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">broader impact</span> of this project is multifold.

Secondly, during each year of this project the laboratory hosted groups of students from local elementary and middle schools, showing them wild-type and mutant zebrafish under a microscope and talking about genetics and inheritance. Thirdly, during each year the PI made at least one visit to an external institution (Cal State Los Angeles, San Francisco State, University of Puerto Rico at Humacao) or a national conference (ABRCMS, SACNAS) to recruit under-represented minority students for summer research opportunities or graduate education at the University of Iowa.
