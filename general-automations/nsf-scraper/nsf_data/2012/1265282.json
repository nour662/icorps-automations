 "awd_abstract_narration": "Populations of the Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) inhabiting urban estuaries have rapidly and repeatedly evolved tolerance to extreme pollution stress, yet the genetic changes that enabled this adaptive tolerance are unknown.  This grant will facilitate sequencing the full killifish genome, and re-sequencing of genomes from many sensitive and tolerant populations, to enable discovery of the genetic changes that facilitated tolerance to human pollutants, and address whether there are a few or many genetic variants that confer tolerance or sensitivity to pollution among the many different populations inhabiting polluted sites.\r\n\r\nA major ambition of both evolutionary biology and medical genetics is to identify the genetic variants within and among populations that contribute to an individual's tolerance to stress or disease.  For example, human individuals vary in their sensitivity to disease and environmental pollutants, and a portion of this variation has a genetic basis.  Studies of the genomic changes in killifish exposed to pollutants provide an excellent opportunity to discover the genetic basis of individual sensitivity to common environmental pollutants in a vertebrate animal that shares many traits with humans.  This research could identify genetic variants that contribute to human sensitivity to environmental pollutant exposures and also offer detailed insight into fundamental mechanisms of the evolutionary process.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBiologists are on a mission to explain why genetic diversity varies so much among species, and to discover the evolutionary importance of different types of genetic variation.  This research has traditionally been constrained by small numbers of species and genetic markers available for study, where knowledge grows with the number of species included in these investigations.  We produced a reference genome sequence plus 48 additional whole genome sequences from a population of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) thereby contributing a new model system for evolutionary genetics research.  F. heteroclitus is a superb study system because its populations are very large, such that natural selection can be very efficient, and they are locally adapted to a wide variety of environments.  By comparing genetic variation within and between species, we discovered genes that may be important for killifish\u00c6s remarkable physiological flexibility that enables their ability to thrive in dynamic and often stressful estuarine environments.  We found a surprisingly high level of genetic diversity among individuals &ndash; higher than for almost any other vertebrate species.  We found that high-diversity and low-diversity genes differ in their functions, and also differ in the number of functional connections they have with other genes.  These findings offer insight into how protein functions and gene networks are related to the evolutionary forces that constrain or enable their evolution.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew Whitehead"
