 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is doing a research study of three models of professional development (PD) to test the efficacy of a practicum for grade 3-5 in-service teachers organized in three cohorts of 25.  Model 1 is a one-week institute based on classroom discourse practices and a 2-week practicum (cohort 1).  Model 2 is the one-week institute (cohort 2). Model 3 is a \"business as usual\" model (cohort 3) based on normal professional development provided by the school district. Cohorts 1 and 2 experience the interventions in year 1 with four follow-up sessions in each of years 2 and 3.  In year 4 they receive no PD, but are being observed to see if they sustain the practices learned. Cohort 3 receives no treatment in years 1 and 2, but participates in a revised version of the institute plus practicum in year 3 with four follow up sessions in year 4. The Lawrence Hall of Science provides the professional development, and Stanford University personnel are conducting the research. The teachers come from the Oakland Unified School District. Science content is the GEMS Ocean Sciences Sequence.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 research questions:\r\n\r\n1. In what ways do practicum-based professional development models influence science instructional practice?\r\n2. What differences in student outcomes are associated with teachers' participation in the different PD programs?\r\n3. Is the impact of the revised PD model different from the impact of the original model? \r\n\r\nThis is a designed-based research model. Teacher data is based on interviews on beliefs about teaching and the analysis of video tapes of their practicum and classroom performance using the Discourse in Inquiry Science Classrooms instrument. Student data is based on the GEMS unit pre- and post-tests and the California Science Test for 5th graders. Multiple analyses are being conducted using different combinations of the data from 8 scales across 4 years. \r\n\r\nThere will be 75 teachers and their students directly impacted by the project. Additional impacts of the project are research results and professional development materials, including a PD implementation guide and instructional videos. These will be presented in publications and conference presentations and be posted on linked websites at the Lawrence Hall of Science and the Center to Support Excellence in Teaching at Stanford University.",

This research study compared the practice of grade 3-5 teachers in an urban school district before, during, and after participating in one of the three professional learning models. Thirty-five teachers in the first two models (Cohorts 1 and 2) participated in a five-day Summer Institute focused on facilitating scientific argumentation. Eighteen of these teachers (Cohort 1) followed the Institute with a two-week practicum in a summer school setting that provided opportunities for team teaching, video reflection, collaborative planning time, just-in-time pedagogical input, and coaching. The other 17 teachers (Cohort 2) rejoined Cohort 1 for eight follow-up sessions over the following two year period during the academic year. Each of the follow-up sessions provided Cohorts 1 and 2 teachers with structured planning time, additional experiences focused on argumentation pedagogy, and small group video reflection. Twenty teachers (Cohort 3) participated in a revised version of the Institute + Practicum + Follow-up Session model, but only received one year of follow-up sessions. The Cohort 3 model also differed from the Cohort 1 model in that teachers received more introduction to strategies for engaging students in argumentation during the Summer Institute than teachers in Cohort 1 had experienced.</p>\n<p>To examine the efficacy of the three programs, videos of the teachers&rsquo; science lessons were collected in each of the four years of the project. Cohorts 1 and 2 teachers were videotaped the year prior to participating in the professional learning (PL) program, at the end of each year of the PL program, and one year after the conclusion of the PL program. Cohort 3 teachers were videotaped the year prior to participation and at the end of the year of PL. The videos were then rated for teacher and student discourses practices. Quantitative analyses of the ratings indicated that professional learning consisting of the one-week summer institute and 4 days of follow up, with or without the practicum, was effective at significantly improving teacher and student discourse practices for all cohorts. Further, Cohorts 1 and 2 teachers continued to improve after the second year of PL, and these improvements were maintained in the year after the PL program concluded. Contrary to our hypotheses, neither the practicum nor the revised version of the PL program had an additional effect. The project thus provides support for the effectiveness of the professional learning programs developed for the project but not the practicum.</p>\n<p>Student performance on the science knowledge test improved from pretest to posttest. There was not a significant difference in science attainment related to teachers&rsquo; participation in the versions of the PL program with and without the practicum. An analysis of the relationship between teacher and student discourse practices and student achievement, as measured by the difference between pretest and posttest scores, suggests that improving the quality of student discourse practices may have a greater effect on student attainment than improving the quality of teacher discourse practices.</p>\n<p>Teachers from all three cohorts showed improved <em>Attitudes toward Argumentation</em> and <em>Confidence in Classroom Practices </em>on surveys after participating in PRACTISE. Gains were largest after the Summer Institute, and scores remained high over time. There were no notable differences by cohort. Teacher feedback on all program components was overwhelmingly positive, describing the experience as &ldquo;more effective&rdquo; or &ldquo;much more effective&rdquo; than other professional learning experiences in which they had participated.</p>\n<p>We also conducted in-depth case studies of four teachers. Analyses indicated that these teachers used more interactive classroom structures after participating in the PL than before. They dedicated more time to interactive talk formats, such as whole group discussion, small group discussion, and pair work. Their classrooms also shifted from more teacher-centered with a substantial presence of I-R-E (Initiate-Response-Evaluate) interaction patterns to more student-centered, with students engaging in discussions that privileged their ideas. The teachers&rsquo; talk moves also increased in level of cognitive demand. For example, prior to participating in the PL, teachers used a high proportion of moves that were at the level of stating facts and making observations. After a year in the PL they implemented a higher proportion of moves that privileged making claims, giving evidence/reasoning, and comparing/critiquing claims; that is, the types of moves that support student reasoning and arguing with evidence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/31/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jonathan&nbsp;Osborne</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1220666/1220666_10199603_1509496853913_PastedGraphic-2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1220666/1220666_10199603_1509496853913_PastedGraphic-2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Professional learning session.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1220666/1220666_10199603_1509496853913_PastedGraphic-2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Professional learning session.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants in professional learning session.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">The Lawrence Hall of Science</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonathan&nbsp;Osborne</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Professional learning session.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1220666/1220666_10199603_1509496907528_PastedGraphic-3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1220666/1220666_10199603_1509496907528_PastedGraphic-3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Professional learning session.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1220666/1220666_10199603_1509496907528_PastedGraphic-3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Professional learning session.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants in professional learning session.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">The Lawrence Hall of Science</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonathan&nbsp;Osborne</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Professional learning session.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1220666/1220666_10199603_1509496977426_PastedGraphic-4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1220666/1220666_10199603_1509496977426_PastedGraphic-4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Professional learning session.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1220666/1220666_10199603_1509496977426_PastedGraphic-4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Professional learning session.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants in professional learning session.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">The Lawrence Hall of Science</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonathan&nbsp;Osborne</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Professional learning session.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
