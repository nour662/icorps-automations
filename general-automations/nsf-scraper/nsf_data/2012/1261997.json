The combination of engineering and biology with a strong focus in medicine will be a hallmark of the planned event. \r\n\r\nThis proposal focuses on the aim of enabling the participation of invited keynote speakers in Track 2: Nano-/Microfluidics in Biology and Medicine: Analysis, Diagnostics and Therapeutic by defraying their registration and travel costs. Technical contributions in Track 2 will consist of oral and poster presentations, including plenary and invited keynote talks. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, Track 2 in NEMB 2013 will highlight research elucidating fundamental physicochemical mechanisms associated with microfluidic and nanofluidic phenomena as well as novel microfluidic and nanofluidic techniques for diagnostic, medical, biological, pharmaceutical, environmental, and chemical applications. Track 2 coverage spans a broad range of disciplines and topics, including protein chip, DNA chip, cell chip, lab-on-a-chip, bio-MEMS, biosensor, micro/nano mechanics, microfluidics, high-throughput screening technology, medical science, genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring and micro/nanotechnology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conference will bring together a diverse group of researchers and provide a cross-disciplinary forum enabling new research collaborations and synergistic interactions. \r\n\r\nAbstracts presented at the conference will be published on a CD and made available to the participants.\r\n\r\nMany of the track chairs and plenary speakers are women.  And accommodations for woman with small children and persons with disabilities have been ensured.",
