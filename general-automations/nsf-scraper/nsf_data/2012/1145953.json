 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how animals and plants interact with microorganisms is critically important to basic biology, agriculture, and medicine. Obligate beneficial symbioses refer to interactions where a microorganism can only live in a particular animal or plant, and reciprocally the animal or plant can only survive if the microorganism is present. Most known beneficial symbionts of insects are bacteria. However, another large and important symbiotic association occurs between a family of viruses named the Polydnaviridae and parasitoid wasps, which parasitize and consume other types of insects. This biology makes parasitoid wasps very important control agents of insects, including many species that are economically harmful to humans. Polydnavirus-carrying wasps can survive in wasps only if they introduce the virus into parasitized hosts. Recent results from the PI's laboratory indicate that polydnaviruses function in parasitized hosts by rapidly integrating their DNA genomes into the genome of the host. However, the mechanism by which this integration event occurs is unknown. The goal of this project is to understand how polydnavirus-mediated integration occurs. This project will characterize the location in the host genome where the viral genome inserts itself. Functional experiments will also be conducted to identify the molecules that control the integration process. In addition to enhancing understanding of polydnaviruses, wasps and hosts, the proposed research will provide insights into a new mechanism of moving genes from one organism to another. The work will promote scientific training and education by providing independent research opportunities for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students. Results from the study will also be used to enhance classroom instruction at the high school and university level.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding how animals and plants interact with microorganisms is critically important to basic biology, agriculture, and medicine.  Obligate beneficial symbioses refer to interactions where a microorganism can only live in a particular animal or plant, and reciprocally the animal or plant can only survive if the microorganism is present.  Most known beneficial symbionts are bacteria.  However, another large and important symbiotic association occurs between a family of viruses named the Polydnaviridae and parasitoid wasps, which parasitize and consume other types of insects.  This biology makes parasitoid wasps very important control agents of insect pests including many species that are economically harmful to humans.  The only way that polydnavirus-carrying wasps survive is if they introduce the virus into parasitized hosts. Polydnaviruses function by replicating in wasps to produce virus particles and in parasitized hosts of wasps by inserting their DNA genomes into thost cells.  How polydnaviruses replicate in wasps and integrate their genomes into hosts of wasps is not understood.  The goal of this project was to address these questions.\n\n \n\nKey outcomes were the successful characterization of a polydnavirus genome in a wasp, identification of many of the genes required for replication, and identification of some of the genes required for integration into the hosts of wasps.  Comparative studies further showed that many of these factors are produced by other polydnaviruses, which suggests key features of replication and integration are similar.\n\n \n\nThese results are of value scientifically because they can be used for improving control of insect pests and applied in biotechnology.  Many species of insects are economically very important to the United States, because they cause significant damage to crops in agriculture and forestry, or cause disease in humans and other animals.  There is also great interest in developing new methods for controlling pest species.  One such approach is using biological control agents like bacteria, viruses and parasites that are able to selectively kill pest species without harming the environment.  Many polydnavirus-carrying wasps are used as biological control agents because polydnaviruses produce factors that kill pests.  During the course of this project we greatly improved understanding of how polydnaviruses function in wasps and in killing pest insects wasps parasitize.  Some of the genes we identified also have potential for direct use in biological control, because they produce molecules that regulate the growth of pest species.  Others have potential for use in manipulating the genetic composition of insects and other organisms.  Thus, some of the polydnavirus genes we identified are useful in biotechnology, medicine, and agriculture as tools for moving genes from one organism to another.\n\n \n\nThe study has benefitted education in four ways.  First, several undergraduate students who worked on the project were able to gain new training that could be used to further their education.  Undergraduate students who worked on the project also came from different states including Georgia, Florida, and Virginia.  Second, the study has been very important in providing advanced training to graduate students and postdoctoral scientists.  Such advanced training was essential to securing permanent university and private sector positions as research scientists.  Third, information generated from the study benefitted teaching at the university level by providing new information to students in graduate and undergraduate courses that focus on genetics, virology and entomology.  Fourth the study benefitted elementary and high school students through outreach educational activities coordinated by the Department of Entomology at the State of Georgia botanical garden, and the public school systems in Clarke and adjoining counties around the University of Georgia.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael R Strand"
