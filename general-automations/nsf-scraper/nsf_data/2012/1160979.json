The proposed center will be established based upon the previous successes at each of the three sites including: a) the Center for Intelligent Spatial Computing (CISC) at GMU for spatiotemporal computing/software development; b) the Center for Spatial Studies (CSS) at UCSB for spatial thinking and analyses; and c) the Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) at Harvard for spatiotemporal applications. \r\n\r\nThe Planning Meeting will solicit input from potential Center members and develop projects and priorities for research. There are existing programs at the three campuses with potential overlap, but the mission of the new Center would be to integrate these technologies into a comprehensive spatiotemporal theory and applications. Research results and success stories will be disseminated through publications in relevant spatiotemporal venues as well as among the center member sites for adoption and outreach. The PIs plan to include leading relevant professional organizations to help broadcast the research results and recruit new members through their organizational channels. The PIs also intend to collaborate with complementary I/UCRCs to broaden the impact of the proposed center's research results.",
