 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is development of integrated photonic platform based on single-crystal diamond and its application for realization of on-chip optical networks that operate over wide wavelength range from visible to mid-infrared. This will be achieved by fabricating optical devices (waveguides, resonators, etc) and systems directly into sub-micron thick single crystal diamond films. Several approaches to realize such thin diamond films will be explored. The research program will introduce diamond into the family of materials suitable for integrated, on-chip, photonics. In particular, diamond's strong third order nonlinearity and its excellent thermal properties will be leveraged to demonstrate low-threshold, high-output power, integrated diamond Raman lasers, as well as wide wavelength range frequency combs based on integrated diamond ring resonators. \r\n\r\nThis work will lay down foundations for the development of diamond photonics and its applications in diverse fields including quantum information processing, sensitive magnetometry, optoelectronics, life-sciences, bio-chemical sensing, gas spectroscopy, precision measurements, and high-frequency mechanical oscillators and switches. The research has strong educational components and will provide a unique opportunity to train students at all levels in interdisciplinary field that combines material science, fundamental physics, devices and system-level integration. Public fascination and familiarity with diamond gem-stones will enable engagement of wider audience. To achieve this, public lectures and presentation will be given at the Museum of Science in Boston as well as at local K-12 schools. The research has strong ties with industry and both diamond manufacturing and applications (e.g. oil industry). The international travel will enable key exchanges with UK firm which will provide high quality synthetic diamond substrates. The PI will also meet with researchers in Belgium and attend a diamond workshop.",
