 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, the idea of simultaneous activation (or transparent coexistence) of secondary and primary nodes is being explored.  Under this new paradigm, secondary nodes are solely responsible for canceling their interference with the primary nodes so that the primary nodes do not feel the presence of the secondary nodes.  Although this new paradigm has the potential of offering much greater spectrum efficiency and network capacity than those under the existing interference avoidance paradigm, it is still in its infancy and current results are only limited to very simple network settings.  The goal of this project is to make a fundamental advance in the transparent coexistence paradigm for multi-hop secondary networks.  Specifically, this project aims to study the following important problems in the context of multi-hop networks: (1) developing new analytical models for the transparent coexistence paradigm; (2) exploring performance bounds and theoretical limits for multi-hop secondary networks; and (3) developing distributed algorithms for multi-hop secondary networks that can offer performance approaching that of a global optimal solution.\r\n\r\nThe findings from this project are expected to make a timely contribution to the research community by removing some fundamental barriers associated with the transparent coexistence paradigm. An important educational activity of this project is to develop new cross-disciplinary course materials for wireless networking, particularly efficient sharing of the radio spectrum.  This project also has plans to involve undergraduates and under-represented students in wireless networking research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs wireless technologies and applications proliferate over time, how to efficiently utilize the limited radio spectrum has become a central theme in the wireless communications community.  The current prevailing spectrum-sharing paradigm for different wireless technologies and applications is the so-called interweave paradigm.  Under this paradigm, the secondary users are allowed to use a spectrum that is allocated to the primary users only when the latter are not using the same spectrum.  This interweave approach is conceptually simple.  But it is conservative in terms of spectrum utilization.  Recent advances in interference cancellation (IC) technologies allow us to explore more aggressive spectrum sharing paradigm.  In this project, we investigated transparent coexistence paradigm, also called underlay by some researchers.  Under this paradigm, the secondary users are allowed to transmit at the same time, in the same frequency, and in the same area, as the primary users, as long as the secondary users can use appropriate IC techniques to cancel their interference to the primary users.  In other words, the secondary users can share the spectrum with the primary users in temporal, spectrum, and spatial domains simultaneously, as long as they can guarantee that their interference to the primary users is cancelled properly.  By allowing the secondary users to access the spectrum at the same time with the primary users, the overall network capacity can increase substantially. \n\nThis project investigated some key technical challenges in the transparent coexistence paradigm.  Since IC is the central technology to achieve transparent coexistence, we focused our investigation on the following questions: How should the secondary users perform IC for interference to/from primary users?  How should the secondary users perform IC for interference within its own network?  How should the secondary users collect channel state information (CSI) between secondary and primary users without imposing additional requirements on the primary users?  We have successfully developed solutions to these questions during the course of this project.  Among the many publications out of this project, the following are two milestone publications:  (1) \"Toward Transparent Coexistence for Multi-hop Secondary Cognitive Radio Networks,\" (IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, vol. 33, no. 5, pp. 958&ndash;971, May 2015) and (2) \"A Distributed Algorithm to Achieve Transparent Coexistence for a Secondary Multi-hop MIMO Network,\" (IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, under review).  In these papers, we showed how to exploit multiple antenna (MIMO)\u00c6s IC capabilities at the secondary nodes to cancel interference and achieve transparent coexistence.  We developed mathematical models to characterize the complex interference relationship among the primary and secondary nodes when secondary nodes are active simultaneously with the primary users.  Based on these models, we conducted investigation on new achievable network throughput envelops for the secondary network.   These new achievable throughput envelops point out new frontier for the performance limit for the secondary networks.  Based on these performance limits, we further developed both distributed and online algorithms for the secondary users to handle real-world operation and dynamic traffic conditions. \n\nThe contributions of our research outcome to the wireless communications community are significant.  Our research outcome filled in a critical gap in theoretical foundation and algorithm design, and has made a major step to bring the transparent coexistence paradigm from idea to practice.  The findings from our project have been widely disseminated to the research community through conference and journal publications, seminars and lectures, and technical exchanges with researchers and engineers at various conferences, workshops, and NSF principal investigator meetings. \n\nThis project ha..."
