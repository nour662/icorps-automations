The proposed research thrusts reflect the expertise of the PIs and include: system-level power/thermal/sustainability modeling, analysis and optimization; system-level reliability, robustness, and system lifetime modeling and optimization, as well as test and diagnosis; on-chip communication fabrics; manufacturing process or system parameter variability impact and mitigation at architecture and system level; 3D integration; advanced memory design, including phase-change and magnetoresitive RAM. In addition, the proposed program will include several cross-cutting research themes targeting different application platforms: embedded, high-performance, cyber-physical, reconfigurable computing and FPGAs. \r\n\r\nThe proposed framework will provide a direct flow of ideas among participating academic and industrial institutions, as well as student/researcher exchanges, while also building a diverse body of participants, with deep implications in undergraduate/graduate education or beyond. The proposed center plans to enable fast transfer of technology from the academic side to industrial partners, and a steady pipeline of graduate students working on industrial-relevant project with direct feedback from industry. All three institutions are committed to a strong educational and advising program, but diversity will be addressed explicitly in their efforts.",
