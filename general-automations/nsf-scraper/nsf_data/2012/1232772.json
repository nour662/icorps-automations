 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project seeks to investigate the alignment between the popular Maker movement and engineering careers.  The researchers plan to develop models of how those involved in the hobbyist community, as represented by the Maker movement, find their ways into engineering degree programs.  The proposed approach uses qualitative data collection and theories grounded in how adult learners navigate career pathways.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project arises from the current emphasis on creating more STEM graduates.  The project specifically investigates alternative pathways into engineering degree programs which may be taken by those currently under-represented in engineering.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.",
