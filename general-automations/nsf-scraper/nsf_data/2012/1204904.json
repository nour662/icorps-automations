 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a set of information security and assurance (IA) courses, using an interactive, hands-on approach, to prepare high school and undergraduate students for workforce opportunities. The curriculum is being structured in modular formats, using project-based learning (PBL) scenarios, which are being adapted to different target groups, including high school and college students, as well as high school teachers and college faculty teaching science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) curricula.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project aims to provide opportunities for high school and undergraduate students to get first hand exposure, practical knowledge and understanding of the concepts of information security and assurance by creating a creating a practical, effective, and engaging curriculum for teaching cybersecurity and information assurance to high school and undergraduate students. The implementation plan involves multiple course offerings, cyber camps, and research projects designed to increase the knowledge, skills, and awareness of high school and undergraduate students in the emerging field of information security and assurance. It builds on activities such as the Cyber Patriot program of the US Air Force and the Digital Forensics Challenge 2011, managed by the US Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3).\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are to: \r\n(a) develop and implement modular course materials and educational resources on cybersecurity, \r\n(b) offer high school and undergraduate students cybersecurity camps and cyber career planning activities, \r\n(c) provide research opportunities for undergraduate students and a Certificate of Completion for students who complete a series of online courses related to information security, and \r\n(d) establish a career pathway for students who wish to become entrepreneurs with expertise in information security. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The need for a curriculum on information security and assurance is critical to the success of business leaders of tomorrow because information security practices, policies and technologies are prevalent in every industry and organization. The threat to corporate data, equipment, and resources is increasing with the proliferation of global cyber criminals and malicious software. This understanding and expertise can help launch new careers in cybersecurity and information assurance. In addition, the program is being developed with specific groups in mind who are traditionally ignored by cybersecurity training programs, including women, minorities, and small-business owners.  Training modules are being disseminated online to the community for general education and learning at www.soihub.org. Formal assessments of the course modules and all aspects of the work provide a foundation for global adoption.",
