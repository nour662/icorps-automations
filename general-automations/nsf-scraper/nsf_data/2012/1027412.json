 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project expands the ongoing CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO), building on its existing capabilities to address the national cyber security personnel crisis. In 2001, the University of Nebraska established the Nebraska Center for Information Assurance (NUCIA) at UNO and, in 2003, it was approved as a the Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAEIAE) and received its first NSF award for SFS scholarships. Since 2003 UNO has produced numerous IA graduates, including 34 Scholarship for Service scholars.\r\n\r\nThe program is designed to present the students with a technical background including network security, reverse engineering, critical infrastructure protection, security theory, the foundations of Information Assurance, and other topics in cybersecurity. SFS students have demonstrated their technical proficiency by participating -- and scoring highly -- in international cyber competitions. Broader impacts of the student support include the students presenting briefings on critical infrastructure protection before Federal and other government officials. The SFS students also work with DoD to deliver cybersecurity training through worldwide workshops, and assist local industry in security auditing and training.\r\n\r\nUpon graduation the UNO scholars have moved on to positions within NSF, Departments of Commerce and Treasury, and the United States Strategic Command, among others. Past SFS students regularly return to the institution and participate in the mentoring and competitions along with current SFS students, thus perpetuating the support as well as linking new UNO graduates with practitioners in the field. NUCIA continues to strengthen its partnerships with local community colleges and high schools to recruit talented students for the SFS program as well as promote awareness of information assurance as a career choice.",
