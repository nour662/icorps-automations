 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the diving physiology of turtles in order to assess the ability of these reptiles to adapt to increased threats of climate change and pollution, and to understand the high mortality from by-catch of  marine turtles during fisheries activities.  Turtles differ from other divers such as marine mammals in that they primarily store oxygen in their lungs and, in addition, have a three-chambered heart, in which a single ventricle selectively shunts blood primarily to either the lungs or the body.  Turtles also survive long dormant periods, during which the blood is devoid of oxygen and filled with high concentrations of lactic acid.  With this tolerance for lack of oxygen, it is unclear why there is such high mortality of marine turtles during short periods of net entanglement.\r\nSelf-contained physiological data loggers will be applied to one species of freshwater turtle and two species of marine turtles in order to document heart rate, blood oxygen depletion, and blood lactate concentrations during a variety of conditions including undisturbed spontaneous dives and net entanglement.  Because of the dependency on lung oxygen, it is hypothesized that a) heart rate will not decrease during dives, b) the rate of blood oxygen depletion will correlate with heart rate during dives, c) that the magnitude and degree of cardiac shunting will vary under different diving conditions, and d), in contrast to most dives, high lactate levels will occur during net entanglement due to struggling. \r\nThis project features collaboration of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the University of California Irvine and the University of Tokyo (marine turtle studies).  Broader impacts of the project include training of the post-doctoral fellow, graduate students, and undergraduates, outreach programs to high school students in the United States, teaching of a class in diving physiology at the University of Tokyo, and the development of a blood lactate sensor/recorder that can be applied to other diving and exercise physiology studies in the future.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA dual fiber optic system was developed to measure blood oxygen levels in vertebrates.  This system has a longer life, smaller and more flexible probes, and a faster response time than current oxygen electrode-based systems.  The system was successfully used on red-eared sliders.  The feasibility of using this system to simultaneously measure blood oxygen levels in aquatic animals and ambient oxygen levels in the water was also demonstrated.   Although the final lactate sensor instrument was not developed under this project due to the unexpected death of the young lead expert, advances toward this goal were made.  The project participants collaborated with bioengineers and made significant advances in the development of the lactate sensor.  These advances are applicable to lactate sensor technology for both humans (with both medicine and sports/exercise applications) and animals. \n\nSmaller and lighter physiological data loggers to measure heart rate, oxygen (using the electrode-based system) and temperature for use on small aquatic animals were developed under this project and successfully deployed on red-eared slider turtles (1-2 kg).

Prior to the workshop, the participants had very little exposure to diving physiology and the techniques used to investigate animal physiology.  A postdoctoral fellow and seven undergraduates were trained under the project.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James W Hicks"
