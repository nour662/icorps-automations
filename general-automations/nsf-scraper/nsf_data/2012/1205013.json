Activities are guided by input from biotechnology industry representatives. Improvements in skills, knowledge and attitudes are evaluated. The project's methodology and outcomes are disseminated through local and national conferences, articles, an on-line e-community, and a capstone conference.",

From 2012-2016, 51 high school teachers participated in two summer workshops workshops, entitled Gene Transfer and Genomics and Gene Cloning and Proteomics, facilitated by KCC Biology faculty who teach in the biotechnology program.  Upon completion of the summer experience, high school teachers were given supplies to conduct biotechnology experiments with their students.  Based on the results of a post-survey, teachers reported the greatest obstacles to incorporating biotechnology experiments into their courses were lack of equipment, lab space, and time.  In response, this project gave teachers access to a lending lab of equipment as well as a trained KCC Biotechnology student who worked with the high school class and assisted the teacher in carrying out engaging laboratory experiments.  The KCC Biotechnology students also participated in virtual enterprise (VE) experience in which they applied their scientific knowledge to develop a product that could be sold by a biotechnology company.   In a survey, KCC students reported they believed the VE experience contributed to their understanding of the course content as well as the interdisciplinary nature of science.\n\n \n\nOCDS responded to numerous high profile reports, such as Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education:  A Call to Action and Engage to Excel, pointing out gaps in achievement for U.S. students and calling for improved preparation of teachers through professional development.
