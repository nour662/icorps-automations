 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit:\r\nAt the local scale, it is well known that wind shear influences convection by modulating convective mode and strength.  However, how wind shear affects convection at the scales required for climate simulations is unknown.  As a result, Global Climate Model (GCM) convective parameterizations do not consider wind shear.  This simplification results in errors of unknown size and increased uncertainties for the GCM's estimate of the Earth's hydrologic and radiation budgets, harming future predictions of climate.  To help answer this problem, this research will test the following hypothesis: In an equivalent thermodynamic environment, convection will be enhanced in the presence of wind shear at the resolution of a GCM.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis will be investigated by using a large number of convection resolving model runs.  These Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations will be provided by collaborators at three institutions: National Center for Atmospheric Research, National Severe Storms Laboratory, and National Centers for Environmental Prediction.  Convective statistics will be derived from these simulations at the resolution of GCMs to understand how convective properties vary with wind shear in similar thermodynamic environments.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:\r\nThis research will help fill the knowledge gaps that exist between the severe convection and climate modeling communities, and will improve the understanding of the Earth climate system and knowledge of current uncertainties within GCMs.  The research results will aid future parameterization development for GCMs by determining whether wind shear and its effects on convection need to be included into future convective parameterizations or may be safely neglected.  If this work supports the proposed hypothesis, the statistics derived from this study will serve as a starting place for parameterization developers.  Regardless of whether the hypothesis is supported or rejected, policymakers and society will benefit from the increased understanding of the Earth's climate system.\r\n\r\nResults from this work will be disseminated to both the climate and severe storm communities.  This will be accomplished by making results available on a public webpage, presenting results at relevant professional conferences, and publishing the results in refereed journals. There will be additional opportunities to present results at the collaborating institutions, which have provided model simulations for this work.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFor many years, scientists have recognized how winds changing with height in the atmosphere can impact the severity of thunderstorms.  Termed wind shear, this property can cause individual storms to persist for longer periods of time and become stronger than would otherwise be expected.  What has been unknown, however, is how wind shear influences thunderstorms over large regions typical of what climate models simulate.  Observations simply don\u00c6t exist to link wind shear to properties of thunderstorms for climate models, and for that reason, these models largely omit this impact.  \n\nRather than using observations to investigate the impact wind shear has on thunderstorms, another solution exists.  For years, weather models capable of simulating individual thunderstorms have been run in support of forecasting severe weather.  By investigating these simulations over areas the size of what climate models simulate, relationships between the two can be investigated.\n\nUtilizing two separate weather models, it was found that convective strength and area was related to the amount of wind shear in the atmosphere. Complicating matters, these properties varied depending on how much energy exists for thunderstorms. Generally, as wind shear increased so did the area and strength of storms.   If too little energy was present, then strong wind shear had a harmful impact on these properties.  This work also shed light on major differences in thunderstorms between the two separate weather models;  this has important ramifications for forecasting.   Results from this study will guide future development of climate models and how forecasters use these weather models.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/21/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron D Kennedy"
