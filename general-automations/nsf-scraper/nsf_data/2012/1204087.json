 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regional response of the high Arctic to past climate events is little known beyond the time period covered by the Greenland ice cores. However, in Spring 2009, a 3.6 million year long sediment record was successfully recovered from Lake El'gygytgyn, a 12km diameter meteor crater lake located 100km north of the Arctic Circle in Chukotka, NE Russia. This grant will continue studies of the paleoclimate record from the lake cores. \r\n\r\nAnalysis of the sedimentary record will greatly extend the known climate history. The team will integrate data analysis with climate modeling to test four hypotheses regarding the relationship between high Arctic climate and climate of other regions. First, no terrestrial Arctic record yet covers the mid-Brunhes transition in sufficient detail to determine whether the cooler interglacial periods observed in the first several 100ky cycles in the Antarctic are also found in the Arctic. Second, the amplitude of 40ky -duration glacial/interglacial cycles in the terrestrial Arctic during early Pleistocene is not known. Third, terrestrial Arctic temperatures during the Late Pliocene, a period of elevated atmospheric pCO2, are also unknown. Fourth, the team will investigate Arctic temperature response to cooling during Marine Isotope Stage 2. These results will help determine the sensitivity of the Arctic to atmospheric CO2 levels. \r\n\r\nThis grant will provide the scientific community with information about the magnitude of climate changes in the Arctic during the 100ky glacial cycles, the 40ky glacial cycles, and from prior to the initiation of Northern hemisphere glaciations. These data will allow direct comparison to the EPICA ice cores, long Asian loess, speleothem, and lake records, and comparable marine records and Global Climate [computer] Models. \r\n\r\nBoth the public and policy makers remain confused about issues relating to climate change. This work should help clarify the background of natural variations in Arctic climate, so that the modern changes can be seen in context.\r\n\r\nFour PhD students and one post-doctoral fellow will receive science and mentoring support. In addition, the team will train STEM teachers by bringing five western Massachusetts teachers per summer to UMass for two weeks to gain hands-on laboratory and field experience and jointly develop curricula that address core elements of the Massachusetts Department of Education science standards. Because lakes and ponds are common across parts of the US, a portion of the teacher training will focus on lake/pond sediments with regard to the environmental and climate change they can document in their communities. This will be accomplished in collaboration with the middle school Earth science teacher who was at Lake El'gygytgyn in 2009 as the PolarTREC teacher.",

Located at 67 degrees north latitude about 100 km north of the Arctic Circle, Lake El'gygytgyn was created by a large meteorite impact about 3.6 million years ago that created a basin 20 kilometers in diameter. This unique basin is the largest and deepest unglaciated freshwater basin in the entire Arctic. Scientific drilling in spring 2009 into a frozen lake without any road infrastructure was logistically challenging and unprecedented, but successful involving an international collaboration between scientists in Russia, USA, Germany, and Austria (Figure 2). Until this project was completed, little was known about the climate change history that took place in the Arctic over the past few million years. The research was risky because of its remoteness, but the science successful providing the first information on the natural evolution of the Arctic borderlands over the past 3.6 million years. Today Lake El'gygytgyn measures about 171 meters (560 feet) deep and contains about 318 meters (1040 feet) of sediment and organic matter deposited since the time of the impact. This sediment and organic matter contains both physical fossils and molecular organic fossils (biomarkers) that allowed us to reconstruct past changes in seasonality, temperatures and precipitation.

Nearly all of these warm cycles were the result of natural causes between 2.8 Ma and 1.0 Ma when the worlds climate changed between warm and cold cycles every 41,000 years; only 2-3 super-warm periods occurred during the past 1 million years when warm and cold climate cycles were dominated by 100,000 year cycles caused by changing dimensions of Earths orbit around the Sun. Some warmer periods can be linked to times when the Greenland Ice Sheet and possibly the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were smaller causing a serious rise in global sea level.
