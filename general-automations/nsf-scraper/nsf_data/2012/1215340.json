 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at developing an automated mortar dispensing system, a major component of a semi-automated masonry (SAM) robotic system.  The current technology challenge is the development of a mortar dispensing system that can accurately replicate the art of manual mortar preparation and application. This means a system that can account for the variability of mortar batch production as well as maintaining the chemical and material requirements to relevant standards.  This technical effort will focus on key variables involved, such as reaction heat, pH, viscosity, moisture retention, time variables and temperature/humidity conditions.  One of the major challenges of an automated mortar dispensing system is the variability created by onsite weather conditions.  This Phase I project will allow us to investigate the feasibility of developing a measurement and control system that can accurately determine the quality of the mortar and adjust as necessary to produce consistent mortar that meets the requirements of the SAM system.  Masonry jobs are dynamic work environments that need to be adjusted and corrected in real time, presenting numerous challenges for automation, but if successful, the potential benefits are enormous. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project, the SAM robotic system, is intended to revolutionize the masonry construction industry.  The system will significantly increase the throughput of brick masonry production.  Our core technology incorporates proprietary sensing and control systems, with the dispensing of mortar to achieve information-driven automated bricklaying.  Brick-based construction represents a significant portion of the global and US economies with over $20 billion spent on all masonry work in the US, and over $5 billion spent on commercial brick masonry.  This segment of the construction industry has seen little innovation over the recent decades. The SAM system will provide a per-job cost savings of over 30% based on increased productivity of the masonry crew.  This significant increase in the efficiency of masons will make brick masonry more affordable. By using more technology in the masonry industry, it will be easier to recruit younger talent to an industry with an aging work force.  The increase in the use of bricks in construction, especially in regions that are susceptible to extreme weather conditions, will provide many environmental and customer benefits such as increased durability, insulation, fire resistance, and lower maintenance.  These in turn will lead to energy and resource conservation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Innovation\n\n Construction Robotics (CR) is a Central New York company developing a system that will revolutionize the masonry industry by bringing automation to the construction site.  This system will work alongside the mason, assisting him with the repetitive and strenuous task of lifting and placing each brick.\n\n \n\nResearch Activity Overview \n\n Automated mortar application equipment or systems do not exist today and present many technical challenges that need to be understood and resolved.  The major challenge and focus of the work funded by this grant was to develop an automated mortar application process for bricks, which can be integrated into the Semi-Automated Masonry (SAM) Robotic system. \n\n \n\nIncluded below is a summary of the work performed for each objective.\n1.      Quantify and characterize the key process characteristics and material critical parameters of an ideal mortar mix for automated application.\n\nThe SAM brick laying system uses a robot to pick and place bricks. Our preferred method of mortar application is to have the robot move the brick to the mortar dispensing system prior to placement. This requires that the mortar: 1) sticks to the brick while being conveyed and placed 2) is able to be pumped.  Our testing and development have determined the critical factors that support adhesion and mortar pumping.  These results have allowed CR to gain the necessary level of understanding to integrate the automated mortar application process with the system.   \n2.      Identify and develop capabilities to measure and control all critical parameters.\nIt is well known that working with mortar requires finesse.  A mason constantly observes the mortars workability and tempers (mixes) it with or without water as necessary.  The feel of the mortar is the mason\u00c6s measure to ensure the right mix.  The measurements we have developed replace the mason\u00c6s qualitative observation of the mortar; these measurements will help us convert an art into a science.  We investigated many technologies from traditional to academic and developed a proprietary inline measurement of mortar workability.  Using this measurement technique we have completed preliminary correlations with the critical process parameters needed for automated application.\n3.      Design and build a prototype mortar measurement and application system.\nThere are many commercially available mortar and concrete mixers and pumping systems. However, after extensive investigation we determined that our unique needs required us to develop and build a custom working conceptual model for evaluation and testing.  This prototype system has provided us enormous benefits in better understanding the process and equipment aspects of our system, and will continue to do so as we evolve. \n4.      Develop process monitoring control plans.\n\nThis objective is closely coupled with the one above.  The prototype hardware we developed has allowed us to understand our process and develop the necessary control plans.  \n\n \n\nConclusions  \n\n Completion of our major objectives places Construction Robotics in a good position for commercializing the SAM System.  The ability to manage mortar consistency and apply mortar to a brick is fundamental to robotic masonry. \n\nOur major findings are summarized here:     \n\nMajor Finding 1: Monitoring and controlling workability is critical\n\nWorkability is the primary critical parameter that needs to be monitored and controlled tightly in order to achieve a consistent and reliable material when using pre-blended standard off the shelf mortar mix.\n\nMajor Finding 2: We can measure workability inline\n\nA mason discerns workability of the mortar through a variety of sensory queues.  We were able to develop an inline measurement concept that is simple and effective.\n\nMajor Finding 3: We have a functional prototype system that supports adhesion\n\nWe have developed a mortar system concept that can bring in wet mortar, measure it, adjust it, and apply it to the brick..."
