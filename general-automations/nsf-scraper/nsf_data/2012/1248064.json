The symposium aims to provide a communication and exhibition platform for experts, scholars, and entrepreneur in the energy and environment field.  The CHEMCON 2012 conference will include not only renowned experts, scholars, and government officials, but also company executives and professionals of investment institutions in Asia, Europe, and the United States. At this event they will discuss and exchange their ideas on ?hot spots??novel technologies?and commercial development so as to encourage cooperative research on energy technologies between India and other countries, and promote the integration of the Indian energy industry with international enterprises and investment institutions. This conference will also provide new development opportunities for international energy institutions and enterprises. There is an urgent need to develop sustainable technologies for energy and environment in process industries. Four sessions are planned in this joint symposium, and are focused on various aspects of sustainable technologies for energy and environment in the process industry. This symposium will fill a critical need and also bring focus to joint efforts between USA and India. It is expected that this symposium will result in a significant increase in the level of cooperation between researchers in India and the US through joint projects, student and faculty exchange and collaborative funding.",
