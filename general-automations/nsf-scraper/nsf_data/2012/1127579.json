The work and conversations of mathematics educators across the world will contribute to understanding of curricular frameworks, research on teaching and learning, the use of technology, strategies for reaching all students, educating immigrant children, and teacher education and professional development. The award will help inform and enlighten mathematics education in this country through international conversations with others confronting the same issues. \r\n\r\nAs a special feature of the ICME program, the United States has been invited to host a U.S. National Presentation, which will include two featured sessions and a special exhibit to be open throughout the Congress for sharing artifacts of mathematics education in the United States with the international community. The award includes support for featured speakers and organizing the US National Presentation. It also includes support for the preparation and update of the State of Mathematics Education in the United States, under the leadership of John Dossey, which will be disseminated at the Congress and through NCTM. \r\n",

Attending the Congress enabled awardees to acquire knowledge of what is happening across the world; learn who the important contributors are (teachers, scholars, researchers) and establish contact and networks with them; bring the problems we have in mathematics education in the U.S. into a better focus; and develop and share insight into new solutions to these problems that emerged from the practice of others or were linked to the results of research. The Steering Committee for the grant consisted of David Bressoud (Mathematics Association of America), Richard Askey (American Mathematical Society), James Roznowski (American Mathematics Association of Two Year Colleges), Janine Remillard (United States National Commission on Mathematics Instruction), Mark Ellis (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics), and two members at large, Natalie Jakucyn and John Staley. &nbsp;A major product of the grant is the booklet on the status of mathematics education in the United States.&nbsp; <em>Mathematics Education in the United States, 2012</em>: <em>A Capsule Summary Fact Book Written for ICME 12</em> (Dossey, Halvorsen &amp; McCrone, 2012) (&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nctm.org/about/affiliates/content.aspx?id=31761\">www.nctm.org/about/affiliates/content.aspx?id=31761</a>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<em>Intellectual merit. </em>The experience at ICME-12 served to advance and spread knowledge and understanding of international educational practice and research findings among practitioners and researchers in the United States, beyond the 50 selected awardees.

The understanding of international issues and practices among educators and researchers in the United States enhanced their capacity to take an informed, global perspective in their work as testified to by many awardees, which in turn benefited their local communities and others with whom they work.
