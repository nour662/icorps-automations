 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a workshop to be held in Ecuador which will focus on investigating and developing capacity to mitigate impacts of mining on water quality in Ecuador. Metallic mining (predominantly for gold) is a major emerging development opportunity for Ecuador, and while there are significant mining activities and impacts ongoing, the proposed mining concessions dwarf those that presently operate. \r\n\tThe workshop will address the following overarching science question: what scientific approach is needed to determine the fate and transport mechanisms that dominate for mercury, lead, and arsenic in mining-impacted Ecuadorian rivers, groundwater, agricultural systems, ecosystems, and human populations? Under this overarching question are many smaller questions, such as: What approach is needed to understand the processes that prevent methylation of mercury in the main sections of mining-impacted rivers? What approach is needed to understand how far mining-derived trace elements propagate from rivers into groundwater, agriculture, the ecosystem, and human populations? What approach should be taken to develop a graphical interface-based relational database to serve scientists and officials in the region? \r\n\tThe workshop will also address the question: What combination of research, coordination, and training is optimal for a robust institution to address the above science needs? Under this overarching capacity-building question lie many related questions such as: What is the correct balance of government and academic responsibilities? What is the proper balance of providing scientific information to the population (including operators, regulators and the general public) versus education and social intervention to protect the environment? \r\n\tThe workshop will bring together US scientists and government experts with scientists and government officials from Ecuador as well as Peru and Colombia, which will add expertise from the entire affected region. The broader impacts of this work will be in a new understanding of priority research questions including a range of disciplines, coordination of international scientific efforts, and input for the Ecuadorian government in terms of how to best coordinate the environmental research and monitoring. A number of US graduate and undergraduate students will attend the meeting and be involved in future collaborations.",
