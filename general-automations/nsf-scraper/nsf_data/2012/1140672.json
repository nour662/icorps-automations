 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this collaborative project Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the University of Massachusetts at Boston are joining forces to provide undergraduate students with experience in computational modeling, simulation, and systems approaches to biology.  Using StarLogoTNG software, developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, students can represent various levels of biological organization from molecules to cells or even organisms.  They can define the rules anticipated to govern the behavior of the designated agents and compare the simulated behavior to that observed experimentally.  The closeness of fit estimates the accuracy of the definition of the rules.  Through hypothesis testing and successive refinement of the simulation, the important rules are revealed.  This hands-on, team-project-oriented approach not only immerses students in engaging learning but also provides an appreciation for the value of mathematics and computational modeling in understanding biology.  Ongoing evaluation measures how successful these strategies are at influencing student learning in both a small, private, technological institution and a large public university.  Widespread dissemination is anticipated.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: In this digital age, many scienctific organizations, including the NSF and AAAS,  have stressed the need to integrate computational thinking and tools into undergraduate biology education.  However, this need is difficult to address.  Computer science courses can be intimidating for biology students, who  often have little background in this area, and  typically such courses are not taught in a way that seems relevant to biology students.  In this project, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a course, 'Simulation in Biology', which is a first step toward addressing this need.  Students in this class learn to use a simple, freely-available language, Starlogo, to create their own computer simulation of a biological system of interest to them. Starlogo uses 'agent-based modeling', in which 'agents' (which could be cells, molecules, or organisms) follow 'rules' of behavior, which students must provide from their knowledge of biology.  In the process of translating a biological system into a simulation framework, students not only learn how to represent a biological system in computer code, but also develop a deeper understanding of the biological system itself.  \n\nRleated Outcomes: \n\n1) Students in the course 'Simulation in Biology' reported gaining computer science knowledge and experience, as well as a better understanding of biology, through building simulations of biological systems.\n\n2) Using the agent-based approach, students developed systems thinking skills.  They were able to see how many different individuals following relatively simple rules can interact to form very complex and interdependent biological systems.  Students were able to test biological hypotheses using their simulations.\n\nBroader impact:   Because we feel the course is best taught by biologists rather than computer scientists, we created many tutorials and other teaching materials for the course; a post-doctoral ecology fellow with little computer science background was able to teach 'Simulation in Biology' with these materials. Thus, the approach is accessible to both faculty and students with little programming background, and could be a first step to bringing computational thinking and tools into the biology curriculum across the country.\n\nRelated Outcomes::\n\n3)  The course was successfully taught both at a small, private, technological univeristy (Worcester Polytechnic Institute), and a large, public university (University of Massachusetts Boston).  It is now a permanent  part of the biology curriculum at both institutions.    \n\n4) We have presented our work at numerous scientific conferences.  We are currently writing up our work for publication, and will make our tutorials and other course materials freely available.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth F Ryder"
