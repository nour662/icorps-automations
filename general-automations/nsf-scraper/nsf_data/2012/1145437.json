 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to understand the taxonomy and evolutionary history of amphibians, reptiles and their endoparasites in one of the most poorly known regions in the world: the lowlands of Central Africa.  Forests in the Congo Basin are renowned for their immense biodiversity, but are increasingly threatened by deforestation, climate change and chytrid fungus infections in multiple genera of frogs. Chytrid infections are linked to global amphibian declines. DNA analyses of samples collected during surveys will be used to identify and describe new species, and to reconstruct their evolutionary history.  The investigators estimate the project may double the approximately 380 species of amphibians and reptiles currently known from the region.\r\n\r\nUndergraduate students will work in teams to participate in cybertaxonomy and rapid-identification projects by analyzing photographs of specimens with associated georeference data via dedicated websites, and in real time as expeditions are occurring.  Project leaders will use solar-powered chargers and computers to blog from the field as expeditions are in progress as a way to engage students, colleagues and the general public in the research. It is anticipated that this project will significantly elevate the global understanding of the importance of the Congo Basin?s biodiversity, and support ongoing, in-country efforts to expand national parks.",
