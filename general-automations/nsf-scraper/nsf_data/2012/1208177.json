 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Justin Droba of Michigan State University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Improving an already-novel modeling approach to laser frequency doubling via impingement upon metal surfaces,\" during the summer of 2012 at Osaka University in Osaka, Osaka-ken, Japan.  The host scientist is Hiroshi Ajiki.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to improve an existing mathematical technique for modeling frequency doubling (second harmonic generation) of laser light by removing restrictive assumptions by taking a multi-physics approach.  This represents an exciting step forward from a noveel existing model, which attempts to characterize the frequency doubling through the electron density of the metal surface that generates the phenomenon.  This technique uses the orbital-free variant of density functional theory (DFT), a subfield of physics that is growing rapidly in influence and importance, in a truly interdisciplinary collaboration.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
