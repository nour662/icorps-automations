 "awd_abstract_narration": "Name:Sethu\r\nProposal#:1149059\r\n\r\nResearch targeted at developing miniaturized, portable cell sorting technologies for isolation of white blood cells (WBCs) containing analytic, diagnostic or therapeutic value with minimal isolation process induced changes (activation) is proposed. Commonly used sorting techniques for isolation of WBCs, rely on the use of antibody and centrifugation -based methods which are associated with cell activation. This project introduces two new techniques that exploit physical and charge based attributes of cells in conjunction with fluid flow phenomenon that develop in microfluidic channels to sort and separate cells. The first technique exploits differences in cell mass density in conjunction with inertial forces using density mismatched fluids in high-aspect ratio microfluidic channels. This technique is suitable for sorting sub-populations of WBCs (i.e.) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from polymorphonuclear cells (PNMs) in an automated format. The second technique relies on differences in cell surface energy to cause initial sorting via phase partitioning and then amplifies this separation using inertial forces in microchannels. This technique will be used to sort specific cellular populations like activated WBCs and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in circulation. Exclusive reliance on flow phenomenon and physical/charge attributes for discrimination into subpopulations ensures minimal cell loss or artifactual activation. Both of these techniques are fast, reliable, require minimal user intervention and are suitable for use in medical or resource limited settings. \r\n\r\nIntegral to the success of this project are education and outreach activities seeking to stimulate the interest and increase the participation of minorities and underrepresented groups in STEM fields. This will be achieved through the expansion and enrichment of a partnership previously established with Central HS, a historically minority institution with 87% minority enrollment and 60% female enrollment. Outreach goals will be accomplished through long-term efforts focused on engaging underrepresented students early, during their HS and undergraduate training. Students within the medical magnet program at Central HS will be introduced to bioengineering and career opportunities through seminars; intellectually engaged via research demonstrations and hands-on activities; motivated through interactions with successful professionals in academia and industry (role models); introduced to scholarship and financial aid programs and offered opportunities to participate in paid research activities. During their research experience, students will receive individual mentorship from undergraduate students from the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) to establish a supportive peer community. Undergraduate research positions will be offered to incoming freshman from underrepresented groups, with priority given to students from Central HS enrolling at the University of Louisville. Complimentary to these activities, the PI will work with two local HS science teachers to create STEM modules on microfluidics as learning tools to enhance understanding of fundamental concepts in science. These learning modules already validated at Walden School will be implemented at Central HS and other schools within the Jefferson County Public School System (JCPS). Research-based learning will also be integrated into all courses taught at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Finally, a laboratory website will be maintained to expose activities in the lab to the local community and others, serve as a recruitment tool and disseminate research and outreach outcomes",
