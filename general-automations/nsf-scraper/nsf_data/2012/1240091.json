 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Noyce Teacher Scholar Program at Benedictine University is providing 2-year scholarships to 27 pre-service undergraduates and 33 STEM professional career changers. In addition, 23 undergraduates potentially interested in STEM teaching careers are enjoying summer internships where they become exposed to the basics of problem-based learning and then assist with the Summer Sleuths program. The project expects to produce at least 49 new mathematics/science teachers highly qualified to teach mathematics or science in grades 6-12. Building on existing campus strengths, the project is focusing on chemistry, physics, biology, and mathematics. The project is partnering with nearby school districts including Naperville Community Unit School District 203 and Chicago Academy High School, as well as the Golden Apple Foundation. The project is utilizing \"Inquiry Weekend Workshops\" to allow Noyce Scholars to learn the basics of inquiry pedagogy from master teachers. A required seminar course \"Careers in Science\" is helping to recruit students to the STEM teaching profession. Master teachers mentor the Noyce Scholars throughout their teaching internship and into their first year of teaching, in addition to allowing the Scholars observation opportunities in their high needs classrooms. Faculty from multiple disciplines are ensuring teachers are prepared with strong content knowledge, a commitment to inquiry-based science instruction, and a thorough preparation in pedagogy. The project is creating a model that includes inspirational educational experiences for future teachers, early exposure to field experiences, and interdisciplinary interactions that help students develop innovative pedagogical techniques. The project is advancing, applying, and disseminating knowledge about strategies for the recruitment, preparation, induction and retention of highly-qualified STEM teachers for high-needs schools in an urban area. Preparing scholars to be the nation's leading educational change agents who integrate inquiry, problem-based learning, and research into their mathematics and science courses will have a significant impact on increasing learning opportunities and achievement for students in high-needs schools. The project also is expected to increase their interest in and enthusiasm for science, which will result in higher numbers of these students pursuing STEM careers. Implementation of the proposed model is being documented so that it can be replicated in other urban settings.",
