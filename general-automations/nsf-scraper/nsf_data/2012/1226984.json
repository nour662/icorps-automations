Texas Austin\r\nXiaoming Wang, EAR-1227212, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nThe proposed work will investigate the causes and effects of environmental change in the southern Tibetan Plateau.  The Tibetan Plateau figures prominently in models of Cenozoic tectonic, faunal, environmental, and paleoclimate evolution.  However, despite extensive research into these topics on the margins of the Tibetan Plateau, little research has focused on the record of environmental change on the plateau itself, and existing data from the plateau is complex and appears contradictory.  The extensive lacustrine deposits of high elevation paleolake Zhada in the Zhada Basin of southwestern Tibet contain abundant vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant fossils and preserves a valuable record of environmental change and vertebrate evolution spanning the last 9 Ma.  The proposed work seeks to use a combination of carbonate stable isotopes (e.g., d18O, d13C, delta47), molecular geochemical and stable isotopic (e.g., MBT/CBT index, d13Cwax) approaches to reconstruct the history of past climate and environmental changes on the plateau from the Zhada Basin sediments and to link these to the changes in the fossil record.  Together, these data will provide the most complete record of environmental and faunal change over this crucial period of time available for this region.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the late Miocene-Pliocene, the Asian and Indian monsoons intensified, atmospheric CO2 declined, and a dramatic expansion of drought-tolerant C4 summer grasses occurred.  These changes have been widely attributed in tectonic, ecological and paleoclimate data and modeling studies to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau in association with the collision Indian and Eurasian plates.  However, recent evidence for a long-lived high-elevation plateau contradicts the hypothesis that the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau was the driver of these changes and suggests a more complex and perhaps spatially asynchronous tectonic and climatic evolution of the region.\n\nThe objective of this research project was to reconstruct changes in the hydroclimate of the southwestern Tibetan Plateau during the latest Miocene-Pliocene, in order to understand changes in uplift, the strength of the Indian Summer Monsoon and the relationships between these changes, global climate and the regional tectonic and paleoclimate evolution of the Tibetan Plateau system.  To do so, we focused on an exceptional paleolacustrine section preserved in the Zhada Basin, which previous studies had shown to have a distinctive, cyclic pattern of sedimentary packages potentially associated with Milankovitch insolation forcing.

The primary techniques used to reconstruct changes in aridity were changes in the oxygen and carbon isotope composition of lacustrine carbonates and changes in sediment grain size.  A transition from a fluvial dominated system to a permanent closed-basin lake will result in an increase in lake residence time and more evaporatively enriched deep lake carbonates.

Although the isotopic changes may be complicated by changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation (associated with changes in source, temperature or monsoon strength), this can be constrained by simultaneously reconstructing oxygen isotope variations from marginal sites that have remained fluvial throughout the reconstructed interval and by using the hydrogen isotope composition of sedimentary leaf waxes, which have been shown to reliably record the composition of precipitation.  Changes in temperature were reconstructed using two approaches: the \"clumped isotope\" paleothermometer, an approach based on the temperature dependent \"clumping\" of isotopes in carbonates, and the brGDGT paleothermometer, which is based on temperature-dependent variations in the structures of acidobacteria membrane lipids preserved in the sediment record.\n\n            The two most significant transitions in our reconstruction occur at 6.0&plusmn;0.1 and 3.5&plusmn;0.1 Ma.
