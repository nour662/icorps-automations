 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to perform a fundamental study on the underlying science of terahertz (THz) wave generation and detection in gases. The approach is to use ambient air and/or selected gases as THz wave emitters and sensors with femtosecond laser excitation. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The principal design concept is based on recent experimental and theoretical research on pulsed THz-wave emission and measurements in air or selected gases. A focused optical pulse with >100 ?\u00ddJ pulse energy and <100 femtosecond pulse duration in gas creates an atmospheric plasma, which produces very intense (>200 kV/cm) and ultra-broadband THz waves (0.1 to 10 THz) in the far field. Using the air-breakdown-coherent-detection (ABCD) method, or the radiation-enhanced-emission-of-fluorescence (REEF) method, air or air-plasma can also sense pulsed THz waves both in local or remote distance.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The fundamental research of THz waves will have an impact in many scientific areas, beyond its historical uses in the astronomy and the laser fusion communities. The resulting technology should find use in many advanced photonic laboratories. The research has the potential to impact a wide range of applications including nondestructive testing, homeland security, and biomedical applications. Research projects with undergraduate students with an HBCU, Morehouse University, will be started.",
