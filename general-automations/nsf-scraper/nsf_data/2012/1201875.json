 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will study mappings in and between sub-Riemannian spaces and more general metric spaces. A recurring theme is the study of generic dimension distortion properties of mappings. Several problems are posed concerning precise, quantitative statements of the frequency with which given Hausdorff dimension bounds hold relative to a specified parameter space: such frequency is measured with respect to measures on the parameter space (in many cases, these parameterizing measures are themselves Hausdorff measures). The preceding themes will be developed in two contexts: (i) metric space-valued Sobolev mappings, and (ii) linear and nonlinear projection-type mappings defined on the Heisenberg group and other Carnot groups. Another theme covered by the proposed research program concerns new aspects of the analytic theory of quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings on the Heisenberg group. This includes both novel constructions of such mappings as well as emerging connections to partial differential equations and sub-Riemannian exterior differential calculus as formulated by Rumin. Additional topics included in the proposal include density of Lipschitz mappings in spaces of Heisenberg group-valued Sobolev mappings, and Hausdorff measure negligibility of highly characteristic points on submanifolds in sub-Riemannian Carnot groups. \r\n\r\nThis research program lies at the intersection of geometry and analysis. Geometry is the study of the structure of space, both the familiar Euclidean spaces of classical antiquity as well as more recent, exotic spaces. Analysis is the study of change and motion: its origins lie in the theory of differential and integral calculus developed by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century, clarified and rigorously formulated by Cauchy, Weierstrass, Riemann and others in the second half of the 19th century, and finally extended to its modern form in the 20th century in work of Lebesgue, Hilbert, Hardy and (later) Sobolev. The two subjects interact extensively: geometric structure both influences and is influenced by the dynamic, analytic behavior of mappings between spaces. Sobolev spaces provide a framework for quantifying the analytic properties of `non-smooth' functions and mappings. They are a foundational tool in modern approaches to partial differential equations. Understanding analysis on such spaces is important for several reasons. First, such understanding provides new perspectives on the classical theory, highlighting relevant and necessary features of the underlying geometry. At the same time, this abstract approach has a greater range of applicability. Techniques and results from analysis on metric spaces have found application in the study of metric graphs and networks, fractals and other geometric environments such as sub-Riemannian spaces. Sub-Riemannian geometries arise in `external' applications to mathematical models of control theory, robotic path planning and neurobiology, as well as `internal' applications to other branches of pure mathematics such as several complex variables, symplectic and contact geometry and geometric group theory. One aspect of the proposed research involving sub-Riemannian mapping theory relates to mathematical models in impedance tomography and image reconstruction.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch supported by this grant and conducted by the PI and his research associates addressed fundamental questions at the intersection of two key areas of pure mathematics: geometry and analysis.  Here geometry can be understood as the study of the static structure of spatial objects, while analysis refers to the dynamical effect on such objects of various transformations or deformations.  The interplay between static structure and dynamical behavior has been a longstanding and central theme in the parallel development of geometry and analysis.  \n\nA primary goal of this particular research project has been to obtain a deeper understanding of the behavior of spatial transformations by analyzing their effect on typical subsets within certain prescribed classes. By relaxing the requirement that such behavior be understood for all subsets and allowing for a small number of exceptions, it becomes possible to reach more precise conclusions which accurately quantify the dependence of such behavior on the degree of smoothness of a transformation. The PI investigated such questions in a variety of geometric settings, some of which arise as mathematical models for restricted or controlled mechanical systems as well as for neurobiological structures which contribute to the processing of visual data.  The PI?s research conclusions contribute to a rich body of literature in the area of nonsmooth analysis and geometry, which in turn informs ongoing applied work in these and other areas.  A number of proposed research goals were accomplished; we highlight here two of the major contributions.  One line of research addressed the effect of degrees of smoothness of transformations on the complexity of the images of typical subsets, measured via notions of dimension.  A second line of research provided new answers to the question of when a general (nonsmooth) transformation can effectively be approximated by transformations with greater regularity.  The conclusions which have been obtained in this latter direction indicate a new set of connections between this topic and other, quite different, branches of mathematics such as algebraic topology.  The implications of these connections continue to be explored in greater detail by several of the PI?s collaborators and other researchers. \n\nAmong the broader impacts of the completed research program are the training and professional development of a new generation of mathematical researchers and educators, and dissemination of the subject through talks, expository articles, and a research monograph aimed at beginning researchers in the area.  Eight graduate students and two postdocs worked with the PI during the lifetime of the grant.  Four students completed their PhDs, and all of them were successful in obtaining academic jobs suited to their interests and experience.  The PI gave numerous talks at other universities and at conferences and workshops across the U.S. and internationally.  In addition, the PI coauthored and published a research textbook on the foundations of the theory of nonsmooth spatial transformations, summarizing the state of the field and describing several major research advances of the past twenty years.  This textbook is intended to serve as a reference and guide for the next generation of mathematical researchers beginning work in the field.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeremy T Tyson"
