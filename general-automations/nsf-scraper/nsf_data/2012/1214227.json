 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a novel type of Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory based on synthetic multiferroics. Magnetic memory commercially used today exploits an electric current for magnetization switching. The bulk of the consumed energy is wasted due to the relatively low switching efficiency. This project investigates the feasibility of using synthetic multiferroics comprising piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials for magnetization switching. The key advantage of using multiferroics is the ability to control magnetization state by an electric field. The utilization of electric field instead of electric current makes it possible to significantly reduce the energy per switch. There is an urgent need in low-power consuming memory devices, which would be of great benefit for a variety of practical applications including wireless devices such as cellular phones as well as other devices biased by the portative energy sources. It is the goal of this Phase I project to provide the feasibility study of the electric-field driven magnetic memory.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes fundamental advances in portative electronic devices and systems enabling lower power consumption and providing longer operation before battery recharging. The development of fast and low power consuming multiferroic memory has the potential to eventually replace the existing memory elements in a market. If successful, this project will lead to a revolutionary change in the data storage technology by providing fast, scalable and non-volatile memory devices. It is fair to say that the development of low-power consuming memory is of great benefit for society offering better performance for a variety of electronic devices and the overall reduction of electricity consumption.",
