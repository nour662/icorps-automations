The host scientist is Professor Kuo-Liang Wen.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to further enhance the basis and understanding of geophysical techniques and their application to seismic hazard analysis and soil mechanics. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
