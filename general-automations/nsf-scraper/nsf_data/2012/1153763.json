 "awd_abstract_narration": "The S-STEM Scholarship Program at EDP College of Puerto Rico supports 27 eligible, under-represented, low-income, and talented students at the undergraduate level on its two campuses and 7 graduate students on its main campus.  Scholarships for Information System students amount to $5,000   per year.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives are:   1) Increase the number of recipients who complete their academic degree providing STEM scholarships and support services by at least 5% per year; 2) Increase retention rate to degree achievement throughout the project duration by at least 5% annually 3) Increase job placement rate of recipients by at least 10% every year.\r\n\r\nThe project is modeled after the successful institutional retention approach known as VIDA, which has focused on first year students since 2009.  The VIDA student support services component is continued and strengthened throughout the S-STEM Project. It also provides an opportunity for talented students to enroll in programmatic bridges that allow moving from baccalaureate to the masters level through a fixed curriculum for this purpose. \r\n\r\nThe Project enhances student support services at EDP College by broadening the participation of Hispanics in STEM fields.  These student support services and retention strategies can serve as a model to other Hispanic Serving Institutions. Disseminating the project outcomes advances the understanding of successful recruiting and retaining strategies, ensuring academic success for under-represented groups in technology careers, thus contributing to the economy and the professional resources within our society.",

Improved educational opportunities for students: Increase by at least 5% per year the number of recipients who complete their academic degree, by providing 31 students (6 Associate, 18 Baccalaurate, and 7 Master degree students) with STEM scholarships and support services.</p>\n<p>2. Increased retention rate&nbsp;of students to degree achievement by at least 5% annually throughout the project duration by offering coordinated, structured and sustained academic and administrative support services.</p>\n<p>3. Increase the numbers of well-educated and skilled employees in technical areas of national need: Increase the job placement rate of STEM scholarship recipients by at least 10% every year by providing coordinated, structured and sustained job placement services.</p>\n<p>4. Improved student support programas at institutions of higher education: Disseminate project practices, outcomes and success on retention practices via the Internet, printed media and at local and national professional conferences.</p>\n<p>In relation to goal 1, the project achieved a completion rate of 28.1% af the end of the first year, 22.2% after the second year, 30.7% after the third year, and 53.8% after the fourth year. In summary, the degree completion rate decreased initally by&nbsp;5.9%&nbsp;but by the end of the project it increased by 23.2%, resulting in a net increase of 17.27%,more than&nbsp;three times&nbsp;the expected rate of 5%.</p>\n<p>In reference to goal 2, there was a retention rate of 90.6% during the first year, 90.3% after the second year, 86.7% after the third year, and 92.3%&nbsp; by the end of the fourth year. Although there was an initial decrease in the&nbsp;retention rate of 3.6%, it&nbsp;increased by 5.6%&nbsp;by the end of the fourth year,&nbsp;resulting in a net increase of 2%. It is important to point out that the retention rate remained high, an average of 90% during the duration of the project.</p>\n<p>Wtih respect to goal 3,&nbsp;a 44.4% &nbsp;of project participants were employed in an information systems or computer technology related field after the first year, 75%&nbsp;after the second year, 65.2% after the third year, and 61.9% by the end of the fouth year. In&nbsp;conclusion, there was a great&nbsp;increase of 30.6% in the employmetn rate during the second year, a&nbsp;decrease of 9.8% in the third year, and another decrease of&nbsp;3.3% by the end of the last term, which results in a net increase of 17.46% for the four year period.</p>\n<p>In relation to goal 4,&nbsp;disemination of project practices, outcomes and success on retention practices were accomplished through the publication of a fifteen pages informational booklet, containing a summary of project activities,&nbsp;graphic images, statistical analysis of project data, and disclosure of project outcomes and results. A total of 3,700 copies of the booklet are being distributed among all of the campuses of EDP University in the cities of San Juan, San Sebastian, Manati, and Humacao. Distribution is also taking place at professional meetings and conferences.
