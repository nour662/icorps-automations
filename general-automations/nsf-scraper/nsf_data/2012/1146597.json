 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate whether carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of CO2 and HCO3-, facilitates CO2 fixation in plants that perform C3 photosynthesis. Moroney et al. (2001) Plant, Cell Environ. 24: 141 reported that Arabidopsis possesses at least 14 CA genes.  Preliminary results showed that a double mutant missing two cytosolic CAs, &#946;CA2 and &#946;CA3, exhibited reduced growth and a reduced affinity for CO2 indicating these CAs play an integral role in CO2 fixation. The overall goal of this project is to determine the roles and importance of different CA enzymes for photosynthesis in C3 plants. The work will involve a molecular characterization of leaf CAs in Arabidopsis and a reverse genetics approach to obtain knockout Arabidopsis plants missing one or more CA isoforms. Using the knock-out plants, the physiological roles of the specific CA isoforms will be determined by measuring gas exchange, mesophyll conductance, and isotopic discrimination in whole plants. \r\n\r\nRecently, Zhu et al. (2010) Ann Rev. Plant Biol. 61: 235 pointed out that a significant limitation to CO2 fixation in C3 plants is the resistances to the diffusion of CO2 from outside mesophyll cells to chloroplasts. This research project will increase our understanding of the factors that affect CO2 fixation allowing scientists to better formulate strategies to improve CO2 delivery and crop yield particularly in the face of increasing atmospheric CO2. \r\n\r\nThis project will be an important component in the education of graduate and undergraduate students.  At LSU, there are many programs to foster participation of a diverse group of students in hands-on research, providing a framework for these students to go on to successful careers in industry, medicine and academics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The world?s population is now over seven billion people and increasing.  An important challenge facing plant scientists is how to raise enough food to feed this many people.  Crop yield is directly linked to the plant?s ability to efficiently perform photosynthesis.  In many crop plants, such as rice or soy bean, photosynthesis can be limited by the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) that reaches the site of photosynthesis in the leaf. Leaf cells contain chloroplasts and that is where the enzyme Rubisco, short for ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, is located.  Rubisco catalyzes the reaction of CO2 with the sugar ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate.  This is the first step in photosynthesis, the process that converts CO2 and water into sugar using light energy.  Research from the University of Illinois showed that plants are very efficient in their use of light energy but very inefficient in converting CO2 to sugar.  In fact one slow step in photosynthesis is the movement of CO2 from outside the plant to the chloroplast where Rubisco is located.  The aim of this study was to study the role of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) in the delivery of CO2 in plants. The long-term goal of this work is to identify which CA proteins are important to photosynthesis and to determine how the delivery of CO2 for photosynthesis might be improved in the future.\n \nFor this study we used the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).  During this study we found that nine different carbonic anhydrase genes are expressed in Arabidopsis leaves.   We also discovered that two carbonic anhydrases designated as &beta;CA2 and &beta;CA4 are the two most abundant cytoplasmic CAs in Arabidopsis leaves. Previously, &beta;CA4 was reported to be localized to the plasma membrane, but we showed that two forms of &beta;CA4 are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and that the two proteins encoded by &beta;CA4 localize to two different regions of the cell. The longer form encodes a &beta;CA4 that goes to the plasma membrane.  The shorter form encodes a cytoplasmic &beta;CA4.  We extended these studies to other CA genes and found that &beta;CA1 and &beta;CA2 also encode for multiple forms of their proteins.  In the case of &beta;CA1 and &beta;CA2, the proteins are found in the chloroplast and the cytoplasm, respectively.  We then further studied these genes by characterizing knockout plants which are plants missing one or more of the genes.  We compared the growth of knockout plants with wild-type plants specifically focusing on the genes &beta;CA2 and &beta;CA4.  There was no reduction in the growth rates of the single mutants, &beta;ca2 and &beta;ca4. However, the growth rate of the double mutant, &beta;ca2&beta;ca4, was reduced significantly when grown at 200 &mu;L&middot;L&minus;1 CO2, which is about one half of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Surprisingly, the reduction in growth of the double mutant was not linked to a reduction in photosynthetic rate. The amino acid content of leaves from the double mutant showed marked reduction in aspartate when compared with the wild type and the single mutants. This suggests the cytoplasmic CAs play an important but not previously appreciated role in amino acid biosynthesis.  In our published work, we hypothesize that cytoplasmic &beta;CAs are required to modulate inorganic carbon forms needed in leaf cells for carbon-requiring reactions such as photosynthesis and amino acid biosynthesis.\n \nWe also studied three additional CAs known as &alpha;CA1, &alpha;CA2 and &alpha;CA3. We have made knockout lines for these genes and have investigated the growth of plants missing one or more of these alpha CAs.  We characterized these CAs, which have not been previously studied at all. We determined where these CAs are made in the leaf and where the proteins are located within the leaf cell.  This award contributed to the PhD dissertation of one graduate student and to the master?s degree for another graduate student.  It also contributed towards five undergraduate research projects, with two of those students going on to graduate school. \n \nThe findings of this project not only increase our knowledge of photosynthesis and plant metabolism, but also identify potential target proteins that might be modified with the aim of improving photosynthesis in crop plants in the future.  We have made this knowledge freely available to the scientific community through scientific publications and scientific presentations, and our work is the basis for a number of projects designed to increase photosynthesis in plants. \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James V Moroney"
