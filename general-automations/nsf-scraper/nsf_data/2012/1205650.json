 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing increasingly permeates daily lives, yet few appreciate the growing presence of Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) in common computing activities; e.g., modern laptops' processors contain multiple cores and special-purpose devices such as graphics processors (GPUs).  With increasing availability of powerful PDC technology, familiarity with single-processor computers and sequential computing no longer constitutes computer literacy.  Technological developments point to the need for a broad-based skill set in PDC at all levels of higher education in disciplines such as Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and the related computational disciplines.  The rapid changes in technology challenge educators to decide what to teach and how to teach it.  Students and employers face similar challenges in characterizing \"basic\" expertise in computing.  The PIs are addressing these challenges via a project devoted to creating and sustaining curricular and educational infrastructure to facilitate the teaching of PDC topics in undergraduate computer-related curricula.  The goal is for every graduating student to become skilled in PDC technology, hence be prepared to enter tomorrow's workforce.\r\n\r\nThe project embodies multiple synergistic activities that develop:  flexible PDC curricula for a spectrum of academic programs and institutions; mechanisms that help individuals maintain currency; instructional materials for PDC-related topics; experience-based guidelines for injecting PDC into curricula.  A signature activity is competitions for early adopters of PDC curricula (winners receive seed funds, equipment donations from industry) and workshops and training sessions to foster awareness and adoption of PDC curricula.  Feedback from early adopters and coordination with the ACM/IEEE 2013 CS Curriculum Taskforce steers future development of both the PDC curricular guidelines and of strategies for deploying PDC material within computing curricula at a larger scale.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by CISE, OCI, and EHR/DUE.",

A series of weekly/biweekly tele-meetings was begun in May 2010; the series continued through December 2010. The goal of the series of meetings was to propose a PDC core curriculum for CS/CE undergraduates, with the premise that <em>every </em>CS/CE undergraduate should achieve a specified skill level regarding PDC-related topics as a result of <em>required</em> coursework. A preliminary version of the proposed core curriculum was released in December 2010. We sought <em>early adopters</em> of the curriculum for spring and fall terms of 2011 and 2012 in order to get a preliminary evaluation of our proposal.&nbsp; The version I document was released in Dec 2012 (<a href=\"http://www.cs.gsu.edu/~tcpp/curriculum/index.php\"><strong>http://www.cs.gsu.edu/~tcpp/curriculum/index.php</strong></a><strong><span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">)</span></strong>, a revised version of the preliminary report based on interactions with the early adopters and varied stakeholders.

Toward these ends, the <strong>NSF-supported Center for Curriculum Development and Educational Resources (CDER)</strong> was founded through this grant. Adoption and reviews have since been carried out continually by selected stakeholders. Funded primarily by NSF and supported by Intel for international adoption, a total of 141 early adopter institutions worldwide, selected via competitions held in Spring-11 through Fall-15 have been employing and evaluating the proposed curriculum. NVIDIA has donated GPU cards to some early adopters. EduPar series has continued with EduPar19 just held in Rio, Brazil. Another workshop was initiated at SC-13 (EduHDC-13) in Denver, the first such workshop at SC.&nbsp; It was followed up by the EduHPC-14 through EduHPC-18 in Dallas.&nbsp; A Euro-EduPar workshop series was initiated at EuroPar-15, and has been held thrice, the latest in Turin at EuroPar-18.
