 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ATE Regional Center of Excellence is based on a solid foundation of past work and successful multi-institution collaboration. The Center builds on proven programs, curriculum, and partnerships, and takes them to the next level. The Center's guiding vision is a 21st Century education system that prepares individuals to participate fully in rewarding careers in manufacturing and which completely meets the needs of the region's manufacturing employers. A single goal is proposed: to increase the quantity, quality, and diversity of technicians in the field of manufacturing. To accomplish the goal, 360\u00b0 proposes three objectives: 1) to enhance the pipeline that prepares students for rigorous manufacturing technician-level programs and entices them to pursue manufacturing careers while implementing strategies to target under-represented student groups; 2)  to refine industry-driven curriculum that is relevant to today's and tomorrow's manufacturing industry; and 3) to assess student learning with both an internal and external focus: an internal focus to drive ongoing program improvement, and an external focus to provide accountability for all stakeholders and evidence of student achievement. \r\n\r\nThe proposed activities include two creative and potentially transformative concepts, one designed to engage girls in STEM learning and one exploring the potential of smart devices to deliver modularized curriculum.  The comprehensive approach proposed by 360\u00b0 addresses several areas that will result in improved student learning in technician education programs, including professional development for faculty, integrating 21st Century technology, and strategically engaging employers to drive curriculum refinement.  The Center advances discovery and understanding through assessment of student learning outcomes and a careful evaluation of what makes each program effective in preparing students for manufacturing careers. Dissemination of findings will have immediate impact for Minnesota, be expanded to North Dakota in years 3 and 4, and ultimately benefit manufacturing education on a national scale.  Four activities focus on engaging underrepresented groups (American Indians, girls, veterans, and rural students) in order to increase diversity in the workforce. The infrastructure for networks and partnerships is enhanced through development of the 360\u00b0 Community of Practice, building on existing relationships and expanding to include additional public and private partners. Center goals and activities are a response to real and immediate needs in Minnesota's workforce.",

Perceptions of manufacturing amongst youth and adult participants have improved through the work of the 360-Center (Wilder Research, p. 12). For youth not highly interested in manufacturing careers prior to event(s) the 360-Center supported, there was a 64% increase in the perception of manufacturing careers, a 57% increase in awareness of manufacturing careers, and their&nbsp;confidence in STEM improved following the events.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Multiple initiatives expanded the use of 360 eTECH curriculum (CMAE), originally developed with NSF funding in 2009.&nbsp;The&nbsp;360-Center piloted online delivery of the 16-credit Production Technologies Certificate and the 30-credit Welding Technology Certificate to rural high schools, ultimately expanding career and technical dual-enrollment options for high school students. Spring 2016 saw the first three high school graduates in the state of Minnesota who earned their 30-credit Welding Technology certificates through Lake Superior College and the 360 eTECH Online and Hands-on Manufacturing Education program. Employers also adopted CMAE curriculum as a way to develop workforce skills on location. Two U.S. Department of Labor TAACCCT grants (AME - Central Lakes College and MnAMP - South Central College) adopted the core curriculum for educating workers. This lead to transferrable college credit and the opportunity for participants to gain an industry-recognized credential through the Manufacturing Skill Standards Council (MSSC - CPT). The curriculum was and continues to be delivered to employer work sites through remote desktop technology (referred to as mediated telepresence), allowing for simultaneous multi-site delivery.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The 360-Center also developed 26 Career Success Skills learning modules, focused on professional and soft skills that employers indicated a desire for.

Most notably, graduates of color increased by 105%. The number of women graduates increased by 36%, older graduates increased by 21%, and the number of first generation graduates increased by 56% (Wilder Research, pp. 5-6).&nbsp;Graduation and enrollment increases are the most appropriate method of predicting the potential of future manufacturing technicians. Since 2012, affiliated college partners saw a 40% increase in the number of diploma/degree graduates, as compared to non-affiliated colleges (11%). In 2014, related programs increased the number of enrollees by 40%.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The work of the 360-Center has focused on changing the perception of manufacturing, providing educational pathways for students, and partnering with manufacturers throughout the state and region. Students, employers, and educators continue to be impacted by the work of the 360-Center and partnering organizations, which is helping to address the shortage of skilled technicians for the manufacturing workforce.&nbsp;Although the 360-Center has met its original goals of increasing the quality, quantity, and diversity of manufacturing technicians, there is still significant work to complete in the coming years. By continuing to successfully lead a complex collaborative of workforce, industry, and education partners, the 360-Center will positively affect the advanced manufacturing pipeline well into the future.</span></span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Resources and References:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><br /></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>360 Manufacturing and Applied Engineering ATE Regional Center (<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">http://www.360mn.org</span>)&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>360 </span></span><span><span>eTECH</span></span><span><span> (<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">http://</span></span></span><a href=\"http://www.360etech.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>www.360etech.org</span></span></a><span>)</span></p>\n<p><span>Career Success Skills modules (<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">http://www.360mn.org/action/skill-development/</span>)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Dream It.
