These students are selected from those attending the annual meeting of Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), which will be held in Jeju, Korea, July 8-14, 2012. The selected students will work on a research project with researchers in the hosting group they are visiting.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide opportunities for students to be exposed to different culture and new research paradigm in other countries, broaden their horizon and help generate new research ideas, and help make them more competitive in the global market and develop into the scientists that are needed globally in the future. The extended visit also helps build bridges between the Asian hosts and the student's home research group in the U.S.  This will facilitate long term collaboration between U.S. and other countries, and advance science and technology in the whole world.",
