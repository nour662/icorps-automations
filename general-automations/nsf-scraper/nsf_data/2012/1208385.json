 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, developing a systematic methodology for the design of multi-fingered robotic hands and grasping devices for a desired kinematic task, represents a novel formalization of the kinematic synthesis of articulated systems as a tree structure. The kinematic task is to be defined as positions and higher motion derivatives of the fingers, with accelerations related to the contact geometry at the fingertips for grasping actions. This research team aims to develop multi-fingered grasping devices for human-robot and anthropomorphic tasks, however the method will be a general tool for the design of any kind of multiple-finger grasping device.\r\n\r\nThis research has a number of broader impacts affecting both the academic community and society at large. First, the project will directly result in a design tool for multi-fingered robotic hands to enable the automatic transformation from task specifications to design alternatives ? an important development in its own right. This design tool will increase the ability of industry to design high performance, cost-effective multi-fingered robotic hands and other end effectors. This directly impacts manufacturing by speeding the development of end-of-arm tooling, with secondary benefits to the cost and quality of the final product. This will assist the U.S. to maintain its leadership and encourage the creation of high-quality jobs. The proposed curriculum additions resulting from this project will produce competent engineers for industry with a greater ability of approaching and solving design problems.",
