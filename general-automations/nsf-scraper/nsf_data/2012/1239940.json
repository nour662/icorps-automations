This project will bring together institutional transformation experts, as well as various constituencies from community colleges and national laboratories for the purposes of disseminating cutting research findings, fostering networking and informing new research directions and paradigms in the social science and organizational change disciplines.  The goals of this organization are well aligned with the mission of the ADVANCE Program.  As such, it is ideally suited to serve as a catalyst in increasing the representation of women in the academic STEM disciplines.",
