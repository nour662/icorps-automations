 "awd_abstract_narration": "Free and open source software (FOSS) is created by individuals and organizations that make the resulting software freely available for anyone to use, study, modify, or re-distribute.  FOSS has become a major part of the software industry and is producing many world-class products.  Among these products are Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software products (HFOSS) that create social benefit in areas such as disaster relief, economic development, and health care.\r\n\r\nExperience with undergraduate participation in HFOSS demonstrates a potential to motivate students, create excellent learning opportunities, and attract and retain female students in computing disciplines.  However, many instructors need professional development and a supporting community to bring HFOSS into their classes.  The Open Source Faculty Expertise (OpenFE) project is expanding the community of faculty with expertise in HFOSS and is also creating, organizing, and evaluating learning materials needed to integrate HFOSS into computing curricula in diverse settings including community colleges.  \r\n\r\nOpenFE is building on prior NSF-funded work to reach a larger and more diverse student population.  Group informatics is being tested as an approach for creating and supporting instructor learning groups.  OpenFE is also incorporating FOSS community learning strategies such as Legitimate Peripheral Participation to create an innovative application of professional learning strategies to undergraduate computing education.\r\n\r\nOpenFE is a collaborative project involving Drexel University, Western New England University and Nassau Community College.",

Even with professional development and shared course materials, faculty benefit from a community to discuss issues and provide additional mutual support for teaching HFOSS.&nbsp; OpenFE supported a series of additional workshops where faculty developed and shared course materials and discussed pedagogy for teaching HFOSS.&nbsp; Members of the OpenFE team also assumed leadership of a second web site and email list that helps instructors interested in teaching students to participate in open source.&nbsp; The email list has about 400 members including a mix of faculty and open source practitioners.&nbsp;
