 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort provides support for student attendance, student networking and student mentoring activities for the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS). Adaptive structures and materials systems by definition are intelligent, flexible systems that have sentience and responsiveness to ever changing environments. The field has rapidly matured due to synergistic interdisciplinary efforts across sectors of universities, government and industry. The purpose of the SMASIS conference is to assemble world experts across engineering and scientific disciplines (mechanical, aerospace, electrical, materials, and civil engineering, biology, physics chemistry, etc) to actively discuss the latest breakthroughs in smart materials, the cutting edge in adaptive structure applications and the recent advances in both new device technologies and basic engineering research exploration. Support from the NSF will promote student participation at the conference to activities that foster technical and intellectual exchange include a student hardware design competition and a student paper competition as well as activities to develop a network of peers and mentors for students that include a student mentoring luncheon and a student outing.\r\n\r\nThe outreach program is designed to engage students who might not otherwise be familiar with smart materials or adaptive structures from local high schools, HBCU's and/or community colleges. The specific goals are to 1) foster technical and intellectual exchange among students who are excited about prospects for research on smart materials and adaptive systems, 2) instill in its participants the sense of a technical community of student peers with a common enthusiasm for research and this technical field and of possible mentors for contact as they develop their own career paths in this field, 3) increase participation of underrepresented students in this professional development activity, and 4) increase participant awareness of the broad range of ideas and topics being studied within this field.",
