 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Adrian S. Johnson of University of South Florida to conduct a research project, entitled \"Learning anatomy in Chinese society via a natural spatial augmented game environment (SAGE) projected onto the self,\" during the summer of 2012 at the Institute of HCI and Media Integration at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.  The host scientist is Dr. Linmi Tao.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is related to using computer vision and augmented reality to create a more natural learning modality and user experience. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

This resulted in new research addressing efficient communication for disabled persons requiring input limited to one bit of information. I was able to conduct and achieve both of these research goals while learning about the culture and conduct of research in a society wonderfully diverse from my own.   \n1) Augmented Anatomy \n\nTraditional computing environments require users to mentally translate I/O through various unnatural and dimensionally cumbersome interfaces such as monitors, joysticks, keyboards, and mice.  Tangible interface research has studied many benefits of bringing human-computer interaction out into the familiar physical world. Recent input devices such as the Microsoft Kinect provide a natural user interface (NUI) that allow natural input yet lack output visualization within the naturally tangible world.\n\nWe have developed a Spatial Augmented Game Environment (SAGE) platform for education and entertainment which augments such NUIs so that the user\u00c6s physical body movements are positioned in 3D within projected output visualizations.  Body-based input and projected output merge spatially to form a natural visual interface (NVI). Users intuitively learn directly with virtual objects in the physical world, rather than through translations on-screen.\n\nThis type of research could lead to improved interaction methods as well as introduce new effective paradigms to education. SAGE may also increase user engagement in education.  It is widely believed that increased engagement and spatial interaction may provide benefit to learning.\n\nTo explore these notions, we user tested an experimental Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) educational game entitled \u00e6Augmented Anatomy\u00c6 designed for our proposed platform on a Chinese student population within China.  We engaged several schools and museums within Beijing to arrange placement of our system within their institutions for user testing.\n\nWe were informed that introductions in China are vital and entering the school system would be difficult.  However, the relationship development process was unexpectedly lengthy. For example, the Alexander school of English Language required the entire summer to ultimately accomplish a session of user testing on students. The school was collocated on the Tsinghua campus directly across from the computer science building. We were referred to the school by my host advisor.

Missing, injured or trembling limbs may not have the accuracy required to manipulate such devices. My host advisor had developed a method for input of Chinese language by using only one bit.  This is useful because disabled people may only be able to strike a large button or other limited input ba..."
