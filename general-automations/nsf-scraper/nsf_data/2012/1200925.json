This site will provide a total of 48 (16 per year for 3 years),  in-service, grades 6-12 science teachers and community college faculty within commuting distance of the NNIN university site, an opportunity to engage in high-quality, nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) hands-on research in state-of-the-art nanotechnology facilities at NNIN sites for 7 weeks during the summer with 1 week of follow-up activities throughout the year, and present their research experience at an annual NNIN Professional Development Workshop. The objectives of the program are to actively engage underrepresented science teachers and community college faculty, or those who serve underrepresented students, in NSE research, build a library of NSE classroom activities and broadly disseminate these activities, and develop a long-term support community of professors, graduate students, NNIN staff, science teachers and community college faculty who will advocate STEM and NSE education and career pathways.",
