 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Yair Korenblit of Georgia Institute of Technology to conduct a research project, entitled \"Nanometer-sized manganese oxide: applications in high energy density batteries,\" during the summer of 2012 at Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST) in Ulsan Metropolitan City. The host scientist is Dr. Jaephil Cho.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in continued development of low-cost catalysts for metal-sir batteries to compare with such expensive and unsustainable catalysts as  platinum-carbon composites.  These substitutes are made by adding a pseudo two-dimensional catalyst on a conductive substrate.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
