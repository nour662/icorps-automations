The conference will take place 10-12 October 2012, at Georgia Tech, in Atlanta, Georgia. The SES conference facilitates the free exchange of information on all aspects of engineering science and provides a forum for discussion, education, and recognition of the talents of the engineering science community. The SES conference promotes the development and strengthening of the interfaces between various disciplines in engineering, sciences, and mathematics. \r\n\r\nConsistent with the SES mission, the 2012 SES Technical Meeting will host a student paper/presentation contest and actively seek the participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering for participation.  The funds provided will support both undergraduate and graduate students.",
