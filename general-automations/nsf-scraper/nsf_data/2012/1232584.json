The conference focuses on the design principles of large-scale networks and distributed systems and, in particular, challenges that are shared across systems as diverse as internet routing, peer-to-peer file sharing, sensor nets, scalable web services, and distributed network measurement. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community?including computer networking, distributed systems, and operating systems?to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes it well-suited as a target for student participation. The support requested in this proposal will enable the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend NSDI.
