 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematics And Earth Science Teachers' Resource Organization (MAESTRO) is a Track 1: Proof-of-Concept partnership project between James Madison University and Harrisonburg City and Page County Public Schools in Virginia.   MAESTRO focuses on improving public Earth System Science literacy, through a regional collaboration of in-service and preservice teachers with STEM faculty, as well as the strategic goals of developing the future geoscience workforce and supporting regional networks that strengthen geoscience education. The partnership is combining mathematics and Earth science instruction in middle and high schools by developing an integrated mathematics and Earth systems science approach to instruction in Grades 6 and 9, where Earth science concepts are typically taught, along with pre-algebra and algebra. This curricular integration is intended to enhance the mathematical skills and confidence of students through concrete, Earth systems-based examples, while increasing the relevance and rigor of Earth science instruction via quantification and mathematical modeling of Earth system phenomena.  MAESTRO emphasizes the development of mental networks and inquiry as means to support student metacognition in multidisciplinary aspects of quantitative Earth systems science.  The project involves two summer professional development workshops and academic year Lesson Study (structured teacher collaboration).  Site-based case studies, developed in collaboration between teachers and JMU faculty members, provide a tangible, relevant setting in which students can apply and understand mathematical applications and scientific processes related to evolving Earth systems. The research component of MAESTRO is focused on the impact of local field-based case studies on student performance in, and perception of, mathematics and Earth science, as well as the impact of Lesson Study on the teachers' ability and willingness to integrate STEM concepts in the classroom.  It is anticipated that the proposed integration across grade bands will first strengthen students' interests in mathematics and science (a problem in middle school) and subsequently reinforce the relevance of other sciences (a problem in high school), both in support of Earth systems literacy. Quasi-experimental evaluation of the impact of this program on participating educators is being used to document project outcomes and indicate the potential of this integrated approach as a model.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe MAESTRO (Mathematics And Earth Science Teachers Resource Organization) was a two-year pilot project, funded through the GeoEd program.  In MAESTRO, four pairs of mathematics and Earth science teachers planned and delivered integrated mathematics and Earth science instruction in four unique situations.  Integration was organized around two central content themes &ndash; evolution of Earth systems and mathematical modeling &ndash; but the actual instructional plans were guided by needs areas as indicated on state-mandated tests. \n\n \n\nIn the two-year professional development cycle, eight teachers participated in two summer planning workshops, experimented with Lesson Study to support their integrated instruction, and developed site-based case studies for local use beyond the project lifetime.  Teachers in two high schools in rural and suburban school divisions developed instruction around the following Earth science topics:  Bio/Geo/Atmo/Hydrospheric interactions, density of Earth materials, plate motion, and geologic time.  Mathematics instruction was organized around direct variation, graphing functions, lines of best fit, and systems of linear inequalities.  At the middle school level in the same school divisions, instruction was organized around formula manipulation, number sense, representations of scale, watershed parameters, and Earth &amp; space science measurements.  Pre-post instruction data were collected on students\u00c6 attitudes on mathematics and science integration and on mathematics and Earth science integration.  Students also completed knowledge surveys to indicate their confidence in answering questions related to the topics of integration.\n\n \n\nComparing the pre-post test data, the pilot project appeared to have had a positive impact on students\u00c6 attitudes towards mathematics and Earth science integration, although there were school-based differences such that the students in suburban schools began with more positive attitudes towards such integration than the rural students.  All students gained more positive attitudes towards the practice of integration in general.  Students\u00c6 confidence in their content knowledge, students showed positive gains in all unit areas.  Of particular note was their increased confidence in mathematics content through their science classes and vice-versa.\n\n \n\nImplementation of the project was not uniform across sites, resulting in varying degrees of impact.  This range, however, established boundary parameters for a planned scale-up project most likely involving many of the original teachers in organizational roles.  Administrative support, particularly at the building level, was critical in facilitating teachers\u00c6 interactions during the academic year.  Where teachers were separated by classroom location and schedules, their capacity for interactions during the day were limited and thus the full potential not realized.  Where such integration came natural to teachers, either by custom or proximity, the value of complementary integrated instruction was realized by the teachers, their administrators, and by their students.  \n\n \n\nAs a scale-up project is envisioned, the following outcomes from the pilot will be used in the design of a larger proposal:\n\n1.  The basic design of mathematics and Earth science integration, supported by summer workshops and follow-on activities over a two-year period was appropriate and provided the teachers with a sense of community around shared instructional needs;\n\n2.  The experimental use of Lesson Planning during the project was important, but other circumstances could hinder the full utility of the design in improving instruction.  Nevertheless, positive changes in teacher approaches to planning and instruction were noted;\n\n3.  Students of participating teachers exhibited statistically significant changes in their attitudes towards mathematics and science integration as well as their confidence with respect to relevant mathematics and Earth science c..."
