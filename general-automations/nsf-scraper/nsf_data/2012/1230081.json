 "awd_abstract_narration": "Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is a type of link-tracing network sampling used to study hard-to-reach human populations.  Beginning with a convenience sample, respondents are given uniquely identified coupons to distribute to other population members, making them eligible for enrollment.  This is effective at collecting large diverse samples from many hard-to-reach populations.  Despite often highly-effective sampling, statistical inference from RDS data is under-developed.  Estimates are based on strong assumptions allowing the data to be treated as a probability sample.  This project develops methodology for RDS in three ways:  (1)  Identifying sources of bias and elevated variance in real populations; (2) Extending the network model-assisted inferential framework to address additional sources of bias; and (3) Expanding the network model-assisted framework to arbitrarily large populations.  In (1), the research will use simulated RDS samples from fully-observed network data to both explore features of real-world network structures that induce bias or elevated variance in estimates, and also to calibrate diagnostics of such features based on sampled data.  Parts (2) and (3) involve advances of the network model-assisted estimator for RDS data.  This is the most flexible estimator currently available for RDS data, but is quite computationally burdensome.  In (2), the project will extend the existing network model-assisted estimator to adjust for additional features of the network and sampling process.  In (3), the project will develop a new variant of this estimator that is more computationally practical in large populations.\r\n\r\nHard-to-reach populations are often at the low end of disparities in wealth, opportunity, and acceptance and at higher risk for negative social and health outcomes.  These populations couple reduced social and health opportunities with a difficulty in collecting traditional probability samples.  Thus, RDS is widely used and is of special interest to social and behavioral scientists as well as public health officials.  This project will allow practitioners to confidently use RDS data in a wider variety of contexts.  Specifically, researchers will (a) better understand which network and sampling conditions might induce bias into their estimators and have better tools to find evidence of these features in their samples, (b) have more options for adjusting their estimators to account for non-ideal network and sampling conditions, and (c) be able to compute the resulting estimators with greater efficiency, making the methods practical even in cases of very large target populations.  The project is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant has supported the development of methods addressing several methodological needs related to respondent-driven sampling.   Respondent-driven sampling is a widely-used network sampling technique used to sample hard-to-reach human populations, often among high-risk groups.  While the practicalities of the sampling method give it broad use and appeal, there is still much work to be done on methodological development.  We have contributed to this process in several ways.\nFirst, we have written two papers introducing methods for inference for population proportions from respondent-driven sampling in the presence of an inopportune initial sample, a common occurrence with the typical initial convenience sampling, with potentially very large implications.  The first, a model-assisted method, relies on direct modeling of the full social network.  The second relies on estimating network edge sampling probabilities and re-weighting the sample of edges.  Building on the previous estimator by Salganik and Heckathorn (2004), this second method is also insensitive to differential recruitment effectiveness.  In the development of this second method, we wrote an additional paper explicating the unequal edge sampling probabilities arising from without-replacement link-tracing sampling on a network.  Previous work in RDS had treated the edge sample as with-replacement, and therefore treated edge sampling probabilities as uniform.\nWe also developed methods for estimation of population proportions in the presence of mis-classificaion error on the binary category of interest.  This paper is the first to consider this issue for RDS, and brings to bear methods from the measurement error literature.\nData quality and uncertainty are also important challenges for RDS.  Estimation of uncertainty for RDS estimators of proportion is an under-studied problem.  To this end, we completed a paper systematically comparing several available estimators of uncertainty.   Related to evaluation, we also completed a paper presenting a battery of diagnostic methods for RDS data.  \nFinally, although the primary use of RDS data is to estimate population proportions, a common and related goal is to estimate the size of the target population.  In a series of two papers, we introduce a novel method to do so using RDS data alone, based on a successive sampling approximation to the sampling process. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Krista J Gile"
