 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bolivia adopted a new constitution in 2009; the new constitution provides an opportunity to analyze \r\nhow people understand a constitution, and how a national constitution intersects with international \r\nlegal frameworks.  The workshop is guided by the questions of whether or not and how Bolivians, \r\nas they go through constitutional change will propose alternatives to globally prevalent intellectual \r\nand cultural property frameworks. These global regimes too often discussed only at international and \r\nnational levels--have fallen short as regards recognition of collective creativity, access in unequal \r\nsocial terrains, and resolution of state-indigenous contradictions about heritage.\r\n\r\nWorking from the ground up, the workshop will initiate a dialogue\r\nabout indigenous rights and cultural property that does not dismiss economic motivations,\r\nconsiders a multiplicity of proprietary systems, addresses already identified social values of\r\ncreativity and acknowledgement, and locates cultural property claims in relation to other local\r\nindigenous struggles. As the poorest and most indigenous country of South America, Bolivia poses \r\npressing local and globally germane challenges for intellectual property, which in Bolivia is viewed by some as an\r\nexternal legal mechanism designed to deny majority access to knowledge, and by others as a\r\nroute out of the nation&#700;s economic woes. \r\n\r\nThis project will facilitate discussion among Bolivians through (a) an intensive four-day participatory\r\nworkshop on cultural and intellectual property involving twenty participants who do creative\r\nperformance work, represent indigenous organizations, or work in local media, and (b) a mediabased\r\ndissemination program. Principal investigators from the U.S. and the U.K. and two\r\nBolivian research assistants will draw on collaborative ethnographic methods to coordinate the\r\nworkshop and media-based dialogues.\r\n\r\nWorkshop proceedings will be summarized for international circulation through a Spanish-English\r\nbilingual website. Before and after the workshop, television and radio discussions (sometimes in\r\nindigenous languages) will further disseminate these conversations among Bolivia&#700;s poorer urban\r\nand rural populations where Internet access is limited. Through the workshop&#700;s activities, local\r\nvoices rarely heard in the international context will be brought into broader global debates, and\r\nBolivians will be provided with greater access to diverse perspectives on cultural property.\r\nThrough the website and subsequent reports, connections will be sought with other international\r\nand national entities engaged in these issues.",
