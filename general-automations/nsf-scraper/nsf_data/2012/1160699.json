This workshop will immediately precede the Korean Physical Society (KPS) Spring meeting. This workshop would bring together over 40 leading researchers, postdocs and graduate students in particle physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics from across the U.S. and Korea. It would provide an opportunity for these communities to initiate long-term collaborations regarding the Korean plan to construct a heavy ion accelerator, KoRIA (Korea Rare Isotope Accelerator) and a Basic Science Institute (BSI) as part of the International Science & Business Belt (ISBB).\r\n\r\nThis workshop will serve as a timely event to bring together U.S. and Korean researchers from academia, laboratories, and industries for discussion of future collaborations in Particle, Nuclear and Astrophysics research. It can help develop a near and long-term plan for KoRIA to serve as a world-class facility that would benefit scientists world-wide. Participating graduate students and post-docs will benefit from exposure to internationally recognized leaders in the field, which will help their career development. The resulting collaborations would involve students in both countries and promote their active exchanges. Other areas such as medical imaging and radiation detection technology will undoubtedly benefit from advancement in the accelerator and detector development. Under-represented groups such as women in science will be actively involved in this workshop.",
