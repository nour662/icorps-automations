 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans), a popular aquarium fish, was introduced to the Atlantic Ocean in the vicinity of Florida in the late 20th century. Voraciously consuming small native coral-reef fishes, including the juveniles of fisheries and ecologically important species, the invader has undergone a population explosion that now ranges from the U.S. southeastern seaboard to the Gulf of Mexico and across the greater Caribbean region. The PI's past research determined that invasive lionfish (1) have escaped their natural enemies in the Pacific (lionfish are much less abundant in their native range); (2) are not yet controlled by Atlantic predators, competitors, or parasites; (3) have strong negative effects on populations of native Atlantic fishes; and (4) locally reduce the diversity (number of species) of native fishes. The lionfish invasion has been recognized as one of the major conservation threats worldwide.  \r\n\r\nThe Bahamas support the highest abundances of invasive lionfish globally. This system thus provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand the direct and indirect effects of a major invader on a diverse community, as well as the underlying causative mechanisms. The PI will focus on five related questions: (1) How does long-term predation by lionfish alter the structure of native reef-fish communities?  (2) How does lionfish predation destabilize native prey population dynamics, possibly causing local extinctions?  (3) Is there a lionfish-herbivore-seaweed trophic cascade on invaded reefs? (4) How do lionfish modify cleaning mutualisms on invaded reefs? (5) Are lionfish reaching densities where natural population limits are evident?  The study will fund the PhD research of 4 NSF Graduate Research Fellows, and will involve participation by a broad variety of undergraduates and reef/fisheries managers.",

This NSF project focused on several aspects of question (2) regarding how invasive lionfish affect Atlantic coral reefs (Fig. 3).&nbsp; These studies benefit reef managers and the public by documenting the negative effects of lionfish and conveying the importance of controlling the invasion by means of lionfish derbies and targeted fisheries:</p>\n<p><strong>(a) How does lionfish predation directly affect populations of native coral-reef fishes?</strong>&nbsp; Multiple field experiments where we manipulated the abundance lionfish on reefs of various sizes showed that lionfish cause severe population declines in many species of native fish.&nbsp; In extreme cases, some species were driven to local extinction.&nbsp; In some cases, baby fish avoided native predators yet not lionfish, which increased their susceptibility to predation by the invader.</p>\n<p><strong>(b) How does lionfish predation indirectly affect the broader native coral-reef ecosystem?&nbsp; </strong>Field experiments showed, first, that lionfish reduce the feeding rate of seaweed-eating fishes.&nbsp; Because seaweeds can smother corals, this effect may indirectly allow seaweeds to displace corals, hastening the demise of already stressed coral reefs in the invaded region (Fig. 4).&nbsp; Second, lionfish have almost no effects on native cleaner gobies, and so do not inhibit this mutualism that benefits the native fish community.&nbsp; Third, lionfish are not attacked by territorial damselfishes, and so have access to small prey that live in damselfish territories.&nbsp; Fourth, lionfish attack one species of basslet more than another, which alters the level of competition between basslet species.</p>\n<p><strong>(c) Are lionfish populations reaching levels where natural population limits are evident?</strong>&nbsp; Field experiments indicated that lionfish must reach very high abundances before their growth rate slows.&nbsp; When lionfish deplete a reef, they start feeding in surrounding habitats, such as seagrass beds, where they also lower native fish abundance.&nbsp; Toward the end of our study, we noticed that lionfish abundances in the central Bahamas were starting to decline despite there being no lionfish removals there.&nbsp; At this time, we are unsure whether this trend will continue.</p>\n<p>Dissemination of this research has included numerous public presentations and over 30 peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals, with additional publications in preparation.&nbsp;
