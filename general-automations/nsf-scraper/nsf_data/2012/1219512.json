A Minor in Nanotechnology for all undergraduate students across the campus will be created and a total of twenty summer research internships will be provided to develop the Process Orientated Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) modules related to Nanotechnology for K-12 education outreach.  \r\n\r\nThis new initiative at WU will provide an excellent opportunity to build an interdisciplinary education and research program in nanotechnology for undergraduate students with a focus on the following components: 1) learning that exposes students to a multifaceted, integrated approach to learning about the fundamentals and new developments in nanotechnology, as well as its environmental and societal impacts; 2) training that offers students research experience in the Nano Research Facility (NRF)-a site of the NSF supported National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) and in the laboratories of participating faculty for exploration of research tools and discovery in the frontiers of nanotechnology; and 3) engaging that connects the students with community and society to impart and promote a basic conceptual understanding of nanotechnology in high school students and teachers.",
