  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSemi-Active Control of Coupled Structures\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe project is an investigation of a real-world problem seen by high-tech fabrication facilities.  The machinery in these facilities is often very high precision, often at the micro- or nano-level.  As such, the vibration levels that can be experienced by these machines without needing repair are quite low.  These repairs can be expensive, but the cost of the loss of production from these machines is critical.  In a seismically active region such as Taiwan, supplemental damping devices may be required to minimize losses.  One proposition is to couple the support of the machinery with the outer structure through a variable damper in order to dissipate energy and reduce the acceleration levels in the machinery.  It is required for the response to be reduced significantly for various excitation levels, so it is not possible to select a specific sized passive damper that is optimal for every situation.  For this reason, semi-active control methods were investigated in order to show that optimal performance can be achieved for different excitation levels so as to protect the sensitive machinery.  The variable damper used is a magnetorheological (MR) fluid damper, which has a damping coefficient that can be controlled nearly instantaneously by varying the voltage commanded to the damper.  The control methods selected were chosen for their simple implementation in practice and their easily obtained feedback signals.  Another factor in the selection of these algorithms was the lack of need for a detailed damper model for implementation, which can often be very difficult to produce and can have detrimental effects if inaccurate.  \n\n \n\nConclusions\n\nBased on the simulation results, both of the proposed control strategies should provide reduced responses in the sensitive equipment over a range of excitation levels.  When compared to multiple passive damping cases, these methods perform comparably to the best damper in each particular case, making the semi-active cases ideal for any level excitation.  These assertions were verified by physical tests of structures dynamically similar.\n\nThe physical tests demonstrated that these control strategies can perform comparably with ideal passive damping at each excitation level and outperforms any passive damper over a range of excitation levels.  However, the simulation indicated better performance of the SDAD controller compared to the Balanced controller while the physical tests showed that the Balanced controller performed extremely well, often out performing even the ideal passive damper for that excitation, while the SDAD controller was only able to perform comparably with the passive tests and was never superior.  This is likely due to the fact that the parameters, &Omega; and &theta;1, were chosen using the ideal structural properties used in simulation.  Due to time constraints, it was not possible to perform detailed analysis in order to optimize these values for the actual structure.  Given the performance observed with the un-tuned SDAD controller in the physical tests and the performance of the tuned SDAD controller in simulation, it is possible that the SDAD controller could perform much better given sufficient time for the selection of the parameters.  Ultimately, these simulations and tests demonstrate the superior performance of semi-active damping systems in reducing the response of sensitive machinery in high-tech fabrication facilities.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/05/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeremy F Hasselbauer"
