This workshop will examine the state of the research and needs for research in the area of nano-safety. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: To address the safety issues, this workshop, \"NSF Nano workshop: Safety Aspects of Nanosystems and Infrastructure for Sustainability (SANIS)  will be held at University of Central Florida, Orlando, Fl, 8-9th Dec, 2011. \r\nThe main topics of the workshop are: \r\n-Personal protection from nano exposure \r\n-Instrumentation for nanosafety monitoring \r\n-Nano storage safety and handling and disposal \r\n-Lab (Hood, sink, storage, etc.) and infrastructure design for nano-research \r\n-Information sharing to keep a safe environment for nano-research \r\n\r\nThe gathering of invited experts to address this safety issues will bring a broad impact to nanotechnology R&D and will be beneficial to the regional and global economy. It is envisioned that this workshop will provide an opportunity to discuss important research activities relating to safety in nanoscience and technology. The event will comprise a diverse community, including renowned experts from academia, industry and national laboratories. The workshop aims to discuss in-depth the current trends and future challenges of nano-safety. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The workshop is also expected to create a sufficient interest among the researchers to develop and further expands cooperative research activities. Discussions with the prominent researchers will lead to new areas of research cooperation and academic exchange. In addition, it is an absolute necessity to create a new breed of safety researchers who can work across traditional disciplines. This is vital to the future of nanostructure science and technology.",
