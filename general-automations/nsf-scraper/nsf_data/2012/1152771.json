 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program, Prof. Xiaowei Teng of the University of New Hampshire (UNH) will develop new palladium (Pd)-based binary heterogeneous catalysts for direct ethanol alkaline fuel cell (DEAFC) reactions. Ethanol has been considered a promising fuel in power technologies, for its high energy density, low toxicity, and availability from biomass. However, the ethanol oxidation reaction is plagued by slow kinetics, inefficient electro-oxidation at room temperature, and its expense when platinum is used as a catalyst. This proposed work will investigate the structure and electroactivity of low-cost Pd-based anode catalysts with highly-efficient oxidization of ethanol in an alkaline medium, and will advance the cost-effective use of DEAFCs.  To understand and optimize the structure-electroactivity relationship for the DEAFC reactions, the proposed research will include: (1) Evaluating the stability of Pd-based binary catalysts and studying their ability to break the C-C bond of ethanol using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, (2) Synthesizing and characterizing Pd-based catalysts using combined techniques, including state-of-the-art aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electronic Microscopy (STEM) and synchrotron-based Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy, and (4) Measuring electroactivities of the proposed Pd-based catalysts for the DEAFCs in an alkaline medium and understanding the mechanism of the EOR through in-situ X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure spectroscopy, through which the optimal Pd-based nanostructures will be determined for highly-efficient oxidation of ethanol into CO2 with C-C bond cleavage in an alkaline medium. \r\n \r\nThe proposed project builds upon the researchers' past accomplishments in DFT calculations, functional nanomaterials, catalyst design for fuel cells, and synchrotron- and STEM-based spectroscopic techniques, and integrates an educational program dedicated to the cross-disciplinary training in materials science and electrocatalysis.  The outcome of the research will impact DAEFCs technology by completely replacing Pt with an alternative low-cost, highly-efficient anode nanocatalyst. The project outcome will support directly the nation's effort to diversify its energy supply portfolio, and help to reduce the global carbon footprint. More importantly, the research will be coupled with an educational program dedicated to training and teaching students about the power of the structure-function relationship, not only for DAEFCs but also fundamental catalysis that drives so many processes.  The research and education integration in this program will provide graduate and undergraduate students with a cross-disciplinary effort that joins material science and electrochemistry. Additionally, the students will have opportunity to receive direct training at national laboratory facilities using state-of-the-art equipment, and to experience how such resources can be utilized throughout their careers to advance research and technology.",
