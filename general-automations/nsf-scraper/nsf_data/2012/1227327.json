 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers often wish to synthesize data from independent studies, using methods such as systematic review, meta-analysis, and expert elicitation. Research synthesis presents difficult methodological questions and approaches have evolved differently across academic disciplines. Both the choice of synthesis method and its application can affect the conclusions, with important implications for decision making. This workshop explores these issues in the context of environmental, health, and safety policy, where such methods may affect conclusions about the toxicity of a substance, the relationship between exposure and health risks, the monetary value of risk reductions, and other policy-relevant research questions.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to improve the methods used for research synthesis so as to promote evidence-based decision making. The objectives include: (1) increasing cross-disciplinary communication and collaboration on methodological issues by bringing together experts from diverse fields to address common problems; (2) defining more rigorously the types of problems and types of data for which different synthesis methods are most appropriate, alone or in combination; (3) developing innovative approaches for addressing specific challenges in applying these methods; and (4) identifying areas where further cross-disciplinary work may be particularly fruitful. The project includes three phases: developing background papers, convening an expert workshop, and disseminating results.",
