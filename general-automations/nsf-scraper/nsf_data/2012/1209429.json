 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals use signals from the environment to initiate reproductive behavior and physiology at the appropriate time.  In many species, information from an individual's social environment is especially important for reproduction.  However, the molecules that mediate this interaction between the environment and the brain are largely unknown.  This project is the first to address whether kisspeptin, a molecule important in regulating puberty, is also involved in social regulation of adult behavior and physiology.  Because the receptor for kisspeptin is found widely throughout the brain, previous studies predicted that kisspeptin has a role in behavior in addition to its established role in puberty.  This research will use a fish species in which social cues control dramatic plasticity in adult male social behavior and physiology.  This species is well suited for studying behavior because it lives in complex communities where the males frequently engage in social interactions, such as defending territory and courting prospective mates.  The project will integrate multiple techniques to determine the function of kisspeptin.  First, genomic analyses will be used to identify the gene for kisspeptin in this species.  Next, the researchers will use molecular techniques to visualize the neurons producing kisspeptin and whether the activity or shape of these neurons change in response to social cues. Finally, the researchers will test if kisspeptin treatment affects a male's aggressive or reproductive behavior and whether kisspeptin interacts with testosterone, a circulating hormone known to influence aggression in vertebrates.  This project will expand our knowledge of the neural circuitry mediating brain and environment interaction.  It will also provide insight into the evolution of genes responsible for social behavior.  Furthermore, this project will provide a valuable platform for engaging two undergraduate students and students from the local community in learning about neuroscience.",

How animals' behavior can rapidly change in response to social information depends on brain processes that are largely unknown.  This grant supported experiments testing whether the neuropeptide kisspeptin, made in a small number of brain cells, plays a role in controlling social behavior.  Kisspeptin is found in the brain of many animal species and is known to regulate reproduction in mammals, however its potential role in behavior is relatively unexplored.  We studied this using a fish species in which males exist in two radically different states and express very different social behaviors.  Males can rapidly switch between these two states depending on social information. We challenged animals with changes in their social environment and measured molecular consequences in brain cells, particularly those producing or receptive to kisspeptin.  We also administered kisspeptin to animals in stable social situations and tested whether the treatment induced changes in behavior, reproductive hormones, or both.  There are two striking results from our study.  First, we found that kisspeptin does not regulate reproduction in our study species, in stark contrast to its role in mammals, suggesting that kisspeptin has evolved different functions in different species.  Second, we found kisspeptin induces behavior typical of animals transitioning between behavior states, suggesting it may be critical for rapid responses to changes in their social group.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/11/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Caroline Hu"
