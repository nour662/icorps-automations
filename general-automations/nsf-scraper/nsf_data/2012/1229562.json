 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Victoria Moore from Elon University and colleagues Karl Sienerth and Kathryn Matera will acquire a multimode quad-monochromator plate reader spectrophotometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education, especially in areas such as (a) peptide aggregates; (b) protein-protein binding; (c) biochemical changes to mitochondria during apoptosis; and (d) quantitative measurements of environmental and explosive compounds.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide a multimode spectrophotometer to make absorbance, fluorescence and luminescence measurements on various samples. These are standard spectroscopy techniques used to assay small volumes of solutions in chemistry and biochemistry. Reactions can be followed and quantities of materials determined.  This acquisition will provide a basic instrument for current biochemistry and chemistry research by faculty and undergraduate students.   Students will be trained to use the most up-to-date assays and technologies which they will encounter after graduation.",
