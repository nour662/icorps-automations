 "awd_abstract_narration": "R/V Melville will be operating in the South Atlantic at the beginning of 2012 in support of the Navy, followed by a 53-day MGG cruise. The ship will then transit to Chile, where it will begin work jointly supported by NSF, Scripps and NOAA on the EPR Triple Junction (PI Blackman), followed by post-seismic studies of the subduction zone by NSF PI Trehu. The ship will then head north en-route to the Galapagos at which time PI Weller will conduct a NOAA-funded mission to make observation in support of the Stratus Ocean Reference Station. After leaving the Galapagos area, the ship will transit to San Diego and finish the year performing a variety of institutional as well as NSF-funded work. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed work is indirect. It derives from the intellectual merit of the individual research projects that depend upon the shipboard work at sea. NSF-funded scientific investigations for 2012 operations include: marine geology; seismic hazard studies; climate observations; and instrumentation development. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe mission of R/V Melville includes the provision of educational opportunities both to students of the marine sciences, and, through educational outreach. R/V Melville operations also contribute significantly to a wide diversity of scientific disciplines, the data from which benefit oceanographic research beyond those studies directly funded to participate in cruises.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit.  At Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and throughout the U.S. oceanographic research community, the observation, measurement, and collection of samples and data are accomplished at sea on a global scale by operations aboard seagoing research vessels. National Science Foundation (NSF) support for the operations of oceanographic research vessels enables NSF-supported scientists to project their ability to observe, measure and sample the planet worldwide, facilitating scientific endeavor across a broad range of disciplines including biology, chemistry, geology, geophysics, physics, atmospheric sciences, and many others.  SIO-operated ships have played a critical role in the exploration of our planet since 1907, and continue to contribute significantly to the U.S. ocean research effort.  Shipboard research, such as that provided by SIO-operated vessels supported by NSF, offers the transformative potential to understand societally-relevant issues, such as global change and the health of ocean ecosystems, on which human well-being may ultimately depend.\n\nThis award supported the operation of the Research Vessel (R/V) Melville during the period 01 APR 2012 through 31 MAR 2017.  During this period R/V Melville carried to sea 41 different research projects, 19 of which were NSF-sponsored projects.  Each scientific program assigned aboard R/V Melville was individually selected through peer review processes, and was directed by its own Principal Investigator with unique objectives, outcomes and intellectual merit. The scheduling of scientific programs aboard the vessel was conducted collaboratively within the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), which has established a system for prudent shared use of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet by NSF as well as other federal, state, and local agencies. During this award period, R/V Melville conducted 725 operational research days.  Of those, 476 (66%) supported NSF-sponsored projects, with the remainder supported by the United States Navy (124 days, 17%), Scripps Institution of Oceanography (68 days, 9%), the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (17 days, 2%), and other programs (40 days, 6%).\n\nAfter 45 years of service to the U.S. scientific community, R/V Melville completed its final mission on 26 SEP 2014 and was withdrawn from the academic research fleet.\n\nBroader impacts.  The spectrum of research projects enabled by these improvements to NSF-supported research vessels collectively achieves far-reaching broader impacts through the enhancement of infrastructure that is critical to the promotion of training and learning, increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in research, advancing scientific and technological understanding and informing policy making for the benefit of society.\n\nFor example, research and research training are fundamental elements of the SIO mission that benefit significantly from the proposed improvements.  Since 1903, Scripps has awarded more than 1,500 PhD and MS degrees to women and men from more than 47 countries.  Our alumni include a college president, five college deans, 21 academic directors, 234 tenure-track professors at 93 universities in 19 countries, and 142 research scientists at 32 universities in 12 countries.  In the five-year period ending in 2010, 630 graduate students and 253 undergraduate students obtained first-hand experience at sea aboard SIO research vessels.  Practical experience aboard research vessels is a cornerstone of SIO?s exemplary research training program, and this experience has contributed to the Institution?s success in producing outstanding new research scientists.  As shared-use resources for the U.S. oceanographic research community, SIO-operated vessels host scientists from throughout the country, and contribute similarly to the education and training missions of other institutions.\n\nAs a charter member of UNOLS, SIO is actively involved in coordinating research vessel operations with scientists and funding agencies so that our capabilities can best meet the current and anticipated needs of the entire community.  Through UNOLS, SIO ship operations and technical support personnel collaborate with ship operations departments at other institutions to broadly communicate best practices, lessons learned, and operational practices that benefit the entire U.S. research community.  During the period of this award, R/V Melville served NSF and the U.S. scientific community by safely, capably and efficiently carrying out its mission to advance our understanding of the oceans, climate, and Earth.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/21/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bruce Appelgate"
