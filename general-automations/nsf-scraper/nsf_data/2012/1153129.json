 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, the research group of Professor Guijun Wang of University of New Orleans designs and synthesizes novel classes of glycoconjugates and studies the formation of self-assembling systems from these carbohydrate-based molecular entities.  Carbohydrates are abundant natural products and renewable resources on earth.  This research aims to advance our understandings on the correlation between molecular structures and macroscopic properties of glycomimetics and to take advantage of the sustainable resource to yield biocompatible materials that have potential applications as light responsive materials or unique supramolecular architectures suitable as ligands for carbohydrate-binding proteins.\r\n\r\nBesides being food and energy sources, carbohydrates also play important roles in biological systems such as mediating signal transduction, cell growth and adhesion, etc.  This research utilizes sustainable resource as the bases to form smart materials that are responsive to various stimuli including light and heat.  The development of new synthetic methods for glycomimetics with desired functionality would enable the generation of novel systems that are potentially useful for biomedicines and biomaterials.  The broader impact activities of this project also include outreach activities to expose children to a fun science atmosphere, internship opportunities at pharmaceutical companies, and the multidisciplinary research training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers (including members of underrepresented groups).",
