 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CRPA award demonstrates to the public the unique use of nanoscience in Nature. The Blue Morpho butterfly is large, has blue wings and is eye catching to say the least. Its wings have been shown to exhibit interesting color characteristics under varying conditions. These characteristics and uniqueness are due to nano-molecules that are a chemical construction in the wing structure. Thus, this butterfly is the hook and segues into a discussion of nanoscience and crystal structures in Nature. Furthermore, the exhibit which is referred to as a flex-hibit is small and portable facilitating its use in out-of-museum demonstrations at public events and in rural areas.\r\n\r\nThis is a colorful demonstration that is quick, interesting and reversible so audiences can be entertained for a short 5-10 minutes during which the \"scientist\" or staff member can briefly discuss nanoscience and how the butterfly uses this disguise. Other scientists may find this flex-hibit idea useful in their desire to demonstrate science concepts, as well. The integration of this work into the NISE network may pay large dividends in helping others with demonstrations.\r\n\r\nThis is a collaboration between Georgia Tech and the Lawrence Hall of Science at Berkeley.",

Flexible exhibits, or flex-hibits, are small-scale, enclosed hands-on science experiments attached to a tablet computer showing videos that explain the demonstrated phenomenon. Drs. Srinivasarao and Park&rsquo;s research at Georgia Tech focuses on the structural basis of color in natural materials (e.g. the iridescent blues and greens of some butterflies and beetles, the rainbow colors of an oil slick). This differs from more typical pigment-based color found in flowers, green plants, or other everyday objects. The staff at the Lawrence Hall of Science worked with Patten Museum Consulting to make three flex-hibit connected to Drs. Srinivasarao and Park&rsquo;s research. &ldquo;Blue Morpho Butterfly: False Colors, Cool Colors&rdquo; compared two species of butterflies to show how a drop of alcohol affects structural-based color compared with pigment-based color. &ldquo;Papilio Butterfly: Mixing Colors in Nature&rdquo; demonstrates how reflecting light in two different orientations leads to color mixing. And finally &ldquo;Creating Art with Light&rdquo; shows optical birefringence and colorful art produced using clear cellophane tape. Each flex-hibit has an iPad kiosk with two specially produced videos. One video stars Drs. Srinivasarao explaining the scientific phenomenon and research connections to the hands-on experiment.
