 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves acquisition of an Aerodyne soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS), a newly-developed instrument that allows the measurement of size resolved chemical composition of sub-micrometer aerosols in real time. The SP-AMS is similar to the Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer but adds an infrared laser and single particle soot photometer for the measurement of black carbon, a measurement that was not obtainable in earlier generations of the AMS. There is also the promise of trace element measurement in some applications. The instrument will provide a cutting-edge analytical tool for scientists at Drexel University who study atmospheric chemistry, indoor air quality, combustion, and public health impacts of particulates. The instrument will also be made available to and foster collaborative research interactions with groups from other universities in the Mid-Atlantic region such as Rutgers University, the University of Delaware, Columbia University, and Bucknell University.\r\n\r\nMany young scientists will benefit from training and research projects that utilize this instrument. One source of such students, the Drexel School of Public Health, has a grant program (R25 from the National Inst. on Minority Health and Health Disparities) for supporting graduate researchers from underrepresented groups, which will immediately encourage the diversity of researchers using the SP-AMS. Impacts to the broader research community will involve the dissemination of research products (e.g., datasets and software tools) for use by other researchers. Positive impacts on society at large will stem from improvements to the understanding of how aerosol chemistry affects climate change, quality of life, and health.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project allowed researchers at Drexel University in Philadelphia to purchase specialized instrumentation to measure the size and chemical composition of particulates in the air.  The particulates that can be measured with these instruments are 100 time smaller than the diameter of human hair and are made up of a complex mix of chemical compounds.  They are so small that they cannot be seen by the human eye.  Different sources such as vehicular exhaust, industrial emissions, or natural emissions from vegetation have specific chemical signatures.  For example vehicular exhaust produces components of particulates that are oil-like.  The detailed measurements made by the instrumentation purchased by this grant allow researchers to tell the difference between different source of particulates, and the processing of these particles by atmospheric phenomena.\n \nNow that this instrumentation has been obtained it can be used in a variety of research projects to understand the concentrations, processes, and sources of particulates.  Much of the research will focus on outdoor particulates or aerosols, and the chemistry that occurs in our atmosphere, but there will be many other projects which use this instrumentation.  Some of those projects will investigate how indoor air quality is impacted by people and the buildings where we live and work. Additionally, the instrument will be used in collaboration with researchers at other universities in the mid-Atlantic region of the US and beyond.  These new research tools will be an important tool for these researchers to investigate the atmospheric particulates in new and exciting ways. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/18/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter F Decarlo"
