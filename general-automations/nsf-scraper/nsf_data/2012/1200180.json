 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this grant is to elucidate the fundamental processes of the oxygen transport, permeability, and release in porous, metal oxide supported biofunctionalized membranes, as materials for bioelectrodes and biofuel cells.  The research project will study the catalytic, redox, and oxygen storage and release properties of metal doped and mixed metal oxides within a porous tridimensional network that will be used to fabricate \"oxygen-rich\" surfaces that are able to operate under physiological and ambient temperature conditions.  A suite of spectroscopic, electrochemical, and scanning electrochemical microscopy methods will be used to facilitate understanding of the oxygen transport mechanism at the enzyme/doped metal oxide interface in the porous layer and to establish correlations between composition, morphology, and corresponding bioelectrocatalytic performance.  This research will improve oxygen availability and permeability at surfaces, enhancing the overall performance of bioelectrodes.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this interdisciplinary collaborative effort will enable development of a new generation of materials and surfaces that can be used in oxygen restrictive conditions.  This research introduces a unique technology in the field of bioelectrochemistry and biofuel cells for facilitating oxygen mobility and providing storage/release capabilities.  This research project will promote innovation and development of critical thinking skills in all aspects of student training to develop a foundation of knowledge that will enable future discoveries.  Graduate and undergraduate students, especially minorities and women, will participate in this research.  K12 students and teachers will be exposed to this research through established mechanisms at the two collaborating institutions.",
