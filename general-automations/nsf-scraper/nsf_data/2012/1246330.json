 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project will explore the commercial feasibility of production of bio-adhesive from swine manure. If successful, this technology will lead to bio-adhesive products that can act as substitutes for petroleum-based adhesive products, and be precursors for novel bio-based products from animal waste. The proof-of-concept demonstration to be achieved by this I-Corps project is the production of bio-adhesive with specified viscosity from swine manure using a modular filtration-vacuum distillation prototype unit. Successful implementation of the project will translate the knowledge created through a prior NSF funding into new products. Successful commercialization of this technology will allow 40.2 million tons of swine manure produced annually in the U.S. to be used to supply about 28 million tons of bio-adhesive for industrial carpeting, packaging, soil stabilization, crack sealing, roofing, pavement construction and fertilizer coating applications.  Therefore, the mission of this proof-of-concept is to bring the rapid, scalable, and cost-efficient bio-adhesive production capabilities of the technology platform outside of the research lab and closer to the market.\r\n\r\nThis project offers a unique, simultaneous approach to 1) develop sustainable construction adhesives as a commercial product, 2) sequester carbon from manure into bio-adhesive, 3) address problems associated with manure management while creating a source of revenue for farmers, and 4) create new jobs related to the production and application of bio-adhesive. Currently, the ability to safely dispose of large amounts of manure limits the growth of swine farms. Development of bio-adhesive from manure will offer a solution for swine manure management while providing a renewable construction material. Therefore, this technology can result in major, positive environmental and economic impacts in both the agricultural and construction sectors.",
