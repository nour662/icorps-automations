A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework will be applied.  Strategies for avoiding or mitigating unintended consequences of the introduction of 2nd and 3rd generation biofuels will be evaluated.  The research targets to inform a more sustainable trajectory for biofuels development in the U.S.  The LCA developed within the research effort will be broadly applicable and potentially will guide future assessments of biofuels.  Education and outreach will include the incorporation of research into undergraduate and graduate courses.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Environmental Sustainability Program and the Energy for Sustainability Program of the CBET Division of the Engineering Directorate.",
