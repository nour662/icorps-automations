 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cascadia is a prime site to understand subduction dynamics and continental accretion, because it has one of the youngest subducting slabs in the world and a wide range of tectonic units. A variety of scientific questions can be addressed at Cascadia: What controls the subduction zone segmentation? What is the role of water transport in the subduction zone? Where does melting occur and how does magma migrate in the mantle and crust? And how does oceanic lithosphere accrete to the continent? Paleoseismic records show that Cascadia has a history of generating ~M9 megathrust earthquakes, so research is needed to improve the assessment of seismic and tsunami hazards from megathrust earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThis project develops and implements an advanced seismological method to construct a comprehensive, high-resolution velocity model of the crust and upper mantle for the entire Cascadia subduction zone. The velocity model provides a detailed structural framework and new understanding of the subduction processes. The structural correlations of a well-resolved model help address whether serpentinization of the forearc mantle varies substantially along strike and how it is related to the subduction of sediments, pre-existing features on the slab, and melt production beneath the volcanic arc. The project tests whether the recurrence of episodic tremor and slow slip events is related to properties of the overriding plate or the subducting oceanic plate. The new crustal model helps in understanding how accretion of oceanic lithosphere contributes to continental growth and subduction evolution. Accurate and high-resolution characterization of the crust and upper mantle structure is also critical to refining seismic and tsunami hazard assessment in Cascadia.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUsing continuous ground motion recorded by over 1000 seismic stations in the Pacific Northwest from the northern California to Washington State, Prof. Yang Shen and Dr. Haiying Gao extracted data that represent seismic waves that propagate between pairs of the stations along the Earth surface.  From those data, Gao and Shen constructed a wave speed model for the crust and upper mantle in the region with a tomographic method that fits the observed waveforms and the synthetics from 3D wave propagation simulation.  The model reveals three low-velocity volumes in the mantle east of the Cascadia volcanic arc, which are spatially correlated with the three arc-volcano clusters.  These low-velocity volumes indicate upwelling of hot mantle induced by the subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate underneath the North America plate.  The magnitude of the velocity reduction in those volumes requires the presence of partial melt.  The results suggest that decompressional melting behind the volcanic arc provides part of the magma that forms the volcanic arc, though the exact mechanisms of magma migration from the back-arc to the arc remain unclear.  The along-strike variations in the velocity structure suggest that the large-scale plate-motion-induced flow in the back-arc mantle is modulated by small-scale convection, resulting in a highly 3D process that defines the segmentation of volcanism along the Cascade arc.  In addition, by comparing observed seismic waves with waveforms predicted by various velocity models for North America, Gao and Shen found that model predictions improve with the increase of seismic datasets and implement of advanced methods. The full-wave tomographic model used by Gao and Shen predicts more accurate phase arrivals compared to other models. The study suggests a need for an integrated model constructed with multiple seismic waveforms and consideration of anisotropy and attenuation.\n\nThe velocity model obtained in this project can be used to improve the predictions of strong ground motion from earthquakes in the region.  The results help to understand the magmatism along the volcanic arc.  The project provided support and training for a young, female scientist.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/04/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yang Shen"
