 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Jin K. Cha of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University to explore the utility of the titanacyclopropane intermediates (Kulinkovich reagent) in organic synthesis.  Particular emphasis is placed at the generation of metal keto homoenolates from cyclopropanols, along with subsequent cross-coupling reactions.  These routes offer attractive alternatives to existing methods, as high convergency is possible to achieve segment coupling.  Additionally, the requisite reagents are inexpensive and environmentally benign.\r\n\r\nThe proposed study involves the development of enabling technology in C-C bond formation for the preparation of useful compounds that can be used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, materials science and biology, and hence has potential for broad scientific impact.  The educational broader impact lies in the training of synthetic chemists expected to contribute to the future workforce in science.",
