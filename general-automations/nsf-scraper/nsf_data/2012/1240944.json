 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alabama (Tuscaloosa) proposes to develop and evaluate a model for the scalable deployment and sustainable persistence of the new CS Principles course across a statewide network of teachers. The model adopts the successful practices of a national Advanced Placement (AP) training program developed by the National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI). It applies those practices in a professional development program based on in-person training and distance learning collaboration. It will provide year-long professional development to support teachers, rather than the week-long summer institutes that are typical of most AP training programs in other STEM areas. A statewide \"Teacher Leader\" model will be explored where those already teaching more rigorous CS courses (e.g., the existing AP CS A) will assist in training new peer cohorts as they establish CS Principles in their schools. Teachers in these cohorts will collaborate together on content and pedagogical learning experiences, fostered by peer leaders and facilitated through A+ College Ready (A+CR), the NMSI partner for Alabama. A+CR has demonstrated success in promoting AP advancement in other STEM areas, especially among students from underrepresented populations. The pedagogical approach will be centered on inquiry/discovery-based techniques that introduce computer science as a broad set of topics as defined by the learning objectives contained in the Big Ideas of CS Principles. The elaboration of the model will support both rural and urban school teachers through use of virtual collaboration tools (e.g., Blackboard Collaborate or ACCESS, which is a statewide distance learning infrastructure deployed in all Alabama schools). The assessment, led by Haynie Research and Evaluation, will uncover the facets of the proposed model that are most suitable for building a successful and sustainable nationwide network of CS Principles teachers. The participants will include: a cohort of 50 high school teachers who will receive year-long professional development training to teach the CS Principles course; students of those teachers, who will participate in summer camps, weekend study sessions, and statewide competitions; and college students from secondary education and computer science majors who will assist with project tasks. Partners include A+CR and the Alabama State Department of Education, which has committed support and needed resources (e.g., ACCESS) to the project. \r\n\r\nTo address scalability, NMSI will recommend the model developed in this project to six partner states across over 320 high schools (in 2011-2012, NMSI supported 75,000 students). To address sustainability, all teachers will be supported after project completion by A+CR under its operations as a NMSI partner. The results of the project will be submitted for publication in journals, and a Moodle website will be created to serve as a repository for disseminating the results of the project, including developed curricular materials. The PI has conducted one of the College Board's CS Principles pilots and leads several K-12 outreach and broadening participation in computing activities in Alabama.",

This outcomes report summarizes our efforts on an NSF CE21 proposal that addressed that question from the perspective of a state (Alabama) that had a traditionally low participation level on the current AP CS A exam. The ability to scale and sustain professional development (PD), particularly with teachers who have a STEM background but little CS content knowledge, is vital to growing the CS10k vision. Our focus was on developing and evaluating a PD model for training several cohorts of teachers in Computer Science (CS) across an entire state geography, with a specific emphasis on the CSP curriculum. The CS4Alabama project adopted the successful practices of a national AP training program developed by the National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI) in pursuit of scalable deployment and sustainable persistence of new CSP courses across Alabama. A statewide Teacher Leader (TL) model was used, where those who have previously taught rigorous CS courses served as mentors in training new peer cohorts as they established CSP courses in their schools. Forty-nine (49) teachers across three cohorts collaborated together on content and pedagogical learning experiences, fostered by the TLs. We have created a CSP curriculum and PD program based on multi-year in-person training and distance learning collaboration, which also was offered as a national online course that had enrollment from over 2,100 teachers across the nation during the summers of 2014 and 2015 (with additional support from Google CS4HS to expand the capacity from a statewide focus to national availability).</p>\n<p>The three-year participants of our project included: 1) a cohort of 49 high school teachers who received multi-year PD training to teach the CSP course; 2) students of those teachers, who also participated in summer camps, weekend study sessions, and statewide competitions; 3) the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE); 4) the principal investigators; 5) an evaluation team with extensive experience in evaluating CSP at a national level (Haynie Research and Evaluation); 6) a K-12 teacher who has been a national Pilot participant and member of the CSP development committee; and 7) college students from secondary education and computer science majors enrolled in a CSP pre-service course who assisted with project tasks through undergraduate research experiences. The pedagogical approach was centered on inquiry/discovery-based techniques that introduced computer science as a broad set of topics, as defined by the learning objectives contained in the Big Ideas of CSP (e.g., Creativity, Abstraction, Data, Algorithms, Programming, Internet, and Global Impact).</p>\n<p>The CS4Alabama project aimed to impact an entire state by preparing high school teachers to offer CSP courses through a replicable PD model that could be adopted in other states. We have openly made available all of our curriculum materials to anyone interested and also developed online materials as part of an online course offered in the summers of 2014 and 2015.
