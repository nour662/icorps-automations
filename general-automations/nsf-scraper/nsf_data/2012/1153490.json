Recruitment efforts focus on underrepresented minorities and first-generation college attendees and therefore diversify the STEM workforce educated in water resources. The program is to transition students into graduate degree programs and ultimately into the STEM workforce. The funding is being used to enhance the experience of students and ensure their success. The program provides mentoring (peer and professional), cohort building and annual retreats to the students. Partnership with potential employers facilitates graduate placement in the workforce.",
