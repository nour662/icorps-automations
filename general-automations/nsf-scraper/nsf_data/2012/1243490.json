 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development and refinement of advanced materials for nuclear and cutting edge applications will allow energy systems to operate with increased reliability, safety, and economy while increasing sustainability and limiting negative environmental impacts. This research will significantly reduce the principal bottleneck for developing future energy technologies, i.e., the lack of reliable damage-resistant materials for use under extreme environments.   The research will critically advance knowledge about the interaction of particle and plasma beams with various materials under extreme irradiation conditions.  These scientific outcomes have related policy impacts for systems modeling and energy planning in both the near and long term for both developed and developing countries as global appetites for energy continue to increase.  Improving sustainability outcomes while securing our energy future entails a global outlook that brings together the appropriate people and resources to not only advance basic research but also to ensure the existence of a diverse, globally-minded and well-trained cadre of scientists, policy specialists, and industry workers.  The goal for this project is to provide robust computer resources and experimental validation to minimize irradiation-based design constraints of materials performance while situating this research within a larger context of sustainability, resource management, and global energy policy.  This project draws on international research partnerships to develop the human capital essential for further work in materials under extreme conditions.  It brings together key partners and research facilities in Japan, Russia, Germany, and Ireland that will enable graduate student research across disciplines with a focus on Nuclear Energy/Fusion, Lithography, and High Energy and Nuclear Physics Applications.  No one location can provide all these facilities; together with resources at Purdue, Illinois, and Tuskegee, students gain critical experience in modeling, simulation, and experimentation. Scientific gains from the experimental research also have potentially far-reaching implications for industrial sectors such as semi-conductor manufacturing using EUVL as well as in energy sectors including solar, wind, and coal.  The education model focuses on engaging students in both course-related and research opportunities and on providing multiple types of international experiences that develop global competencies. The project is funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) through the PIRE.",

Major goal of this Purdue-led PIRE program was to critically advance knowledge about the interaction of particle and plasma beams with various materials under extreme irradiation conditions for nuclear fusion energy, advanced nanolithography, high energy, and nuclear physics applications. Project provided robust computer resources and experimental validation to minimize irradiation-based design constraints of materials performance while situating this research within a larger context of sustainability, resource management, global energy policy, scientific and technological advancement, national and international cross-cultural understanding and exchanges, advanced training, and education support to PIRE students through highly skilled postdocs, engineers, scientists, and state-of-the art worldwide faculties.</p>\n<p>PIRE team was intensively involved in developing alternative materials for plasmas facing components in nuclear fusion reactors other than tungsten, since there is serious concern about its surface morphology changes under helium ion and/or plasma irradiation under extreme fusion environment for successful realization of future devices, e.g., the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) currently being built in France. Unique multifunctional experimental facilities containing in-situ sequential and simultaneous high-flux dual-ion beam irradiation and transient-heat loading to simulate edge-localized modes (ELMs) in reactors have been developed at the center for materials under extreme environment (CMUXE) at Purdue. This allowed to create not only the &ldquo;real reactor condition&rdquo; at &ldquo;laboratory scale&rdquo; but also to design and perform other critical surface science experiments simultaneously in real-time. The studies using laser-material interaction (LMI), laser-produced plasmas (LPP), and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) have boosted the physics of understanding of materials&rsquo; behavior and special nuclear materials detection. Advanced integrated models, in-house benchmarking, and extensive collaboration impacted heavily on LPP development and optimization, materials&rsquo; prediction and performance in nuclear fusion reactors, and cutting edges of plasma and material science. New results found for near zero optical-reflectivity of photocatalytic fuzzy structures can significantly impact solar power concentration technology for hydrogen production for energy applications and supercapacitors. The team succeeded in removing most of the Te-inclusions and/or defects from CdZnTe crystals for enhancing the detection efficiency of CdZnTe based radiation detectors. A thorough understanding of plasma using single- and dual-pulse LIBS, ultrafast LPP, and laser filamentation filled the knowledge gap and helped advancing the understanding of interaction of ultrafast LMI (TH<sub>Z</sub> generation and laser induced filamentation for remote sensing &amp; detection of nuclear materials, homeland security, and environmental monitoring). On one hand extreme ultraviolet (EUV) studies provided better understanding for improving the conversion efficiency of laser to EUV photons for future nanolithography and next generation computer chips, and on the other hand, studies on cold atmospheric plasma for biomedical applications have resulted a great potential in treating cancer cells compared to the traditional chemotherapy methods without harming healthy cells.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PIRE program has educated 12 undergraduate students (including 3 internships in US Govt. agencies), produced 8 M.Sc. and 14 Ph.D. theses (including five women) and has mentored 4 Postdocs. Several students have visited Forschungszentrum Julich, Germany, DCU-Dublin, Ireland, Osaka University, Japan, and Ioffe Institute, Russia for collaborative research with international PIRE partners. Over 65 international journal articles, 130 conference proceedings/presentation, motivation for over 40 students to pursue their research in Nuclear Engineering and Materials science, over 50 national and international student awards were the additional highlights of PIRE project. The CMUXE team has participated yearly in the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) research program at Purdue and has trained over 18 undergraduate students. Over 5 undergraduate students from TU visited CMUXE for performing their experiments. PIRE team also outreached to middle- and high-underrepresented school students. The team regularly organized bimonthly video conferences for all PIRE-PIs with active participation of PIRE-students for discussing research challenges and collaborations. Other activities to disseminate the work developed under PIRE project were through course materials and undergraduate coursework in the areas of advanced energy systems and radiation interaction with materials. The goal was to provide educational materials that accurately reflect realistic energy scenarios using real-world data. The simulation exercise was described through the interactions with leading energy analysis and climate change groups in Germany and England.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/30/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ahmed&nbsp;Hassanein</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1243490/1243490_10215992_1532658298171_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1243490/1243490_10215992_1532658298171_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1243490/1243490_10215992_1532658298171_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PIRE student international workshop and activities at CMUXE.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">PURDUE-CMUXE</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ahmed&nbsp;Hassanein</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1243490/1243490_10215992_1532658507889_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1243490/1243490_10215992_1532658507889_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1243490/1243490_10215992_1532658507889_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Regular meetings at CMUXE, SURF participation, and laboratory research & science demos for Seminar for Top Engineering Prospects seminar for high-school and K-12 students (Yearly, PU).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">PURDUE-CMUXE</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ahmed&nbsp;Hassanein</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1243490/1243490_10215992_1532658573586_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1243490/1243490_10215992_1532658573586_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1243490/1243490_10215992_1532658573586_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example Collaborative research (Worldwide PIRE-partners? laboratories): CMUXE graduate students at FZJ, Germany.
