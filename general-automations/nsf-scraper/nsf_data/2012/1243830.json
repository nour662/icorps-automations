 "awd_abstract_narration": "This international travel award to Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) provides support that will enable a diverse group of approximately twenty-five U.S. graduate students to attend the annual meeting of Nobel Laureates in Lindau, Germany. Since 1951, Nobel Prize winners and students in chemistry, physics, and physiology or medicine have met annually in Lindau, Germany. Each year an international group of some 600 students is invited to attend the weeklong meeting. The program includes formal lectures in the mornings and the remainder of each day is set aside for the students to meet informally with the Nobel Laureate scientists, as well as with their fellow students from around the world. The programmatic cycle revolves among the three Nobel themes noted above, followed by a multidisciplinary theme every fourth year that embraces all three of these Nobel focus areas. Together with another approximately thirty-five-member cohort supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, (DOE), the National institutes of Health (NIH), ORAU, and private foundations, this grant brings to seventy the number of graduate students in the U.S. delegation that will participate in these meetings. The objective of this program is to motivate participating U.S. students toward excellence in their chosen careers through their exposure to and interaction with Nobel Laureates and fellow students from around the world. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this international travel activity and NSF support of it by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and include the likely synergistic impact on the participating students' scientific career development, the potential for initiating career-long international scientific interactions, and the opportunity to promote diversity at multiple levels among the student participants.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the final year of this award, NSF funded eight chemistry graduate students to attend the 67th Lindau Nobel Laureate Chemistry Meeting in Lindau, Germany, from June 25 through June 30, 2017; additionally, 13 economics graduate students were supported by NSF to attend the 6th Lindau Nobel Laureate Economics Meeting from August 22 through August 26, 2017.\n\nThe Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings provided participants with opportunities to form new research collaborations with Laureates and other young researchers and economists.  Through their networking, participants gained valuable global perspective on research that prepares them for leadership in the global community.  As one NSF-supported chemistry student noted, \"this experience really motivates already leading young scientists to push their hardest in their career trajectories.\"  Another chemistry student added, \"I was definitely inspired, and this will affect the research I do.\"  One of the economics students noted, \"More insightful than any one plenary lecture was just seeing how the Laureates approached new research.\" \n\nThe meetings also provided the students with unique networking opportunities that are typically not available within their normal university environment, whereby Laureates provided formal plenary lectures and led small group discussions with topics driven by a combination of prepared presentations, as well as student questions.  The Laureates presented a broad selection of topics related to their respective fields of study (i.e., chemistry or economics).  For example, one chemistry student commented that \"the plenary lectures outside of my field were the most valuable for me since I learned the most from them.\"  Another chemistry student stated that Nobel Laureate Peter Agre's lecture on aquaporins \"was inspiring.\" \n\nThe students were provided with career advice, as well.  One of the NSF-sponsored young economists summarized his experience and the impact to his future career:  \"it was refreshing to envision my burgeoning career outside the (comparatively small) world of our program.  Interacting with young economists from around the world and talking to them about what it's like to get started in this field leant me some perspective as I think about the job market.  This conference represented a significant opportunity to network in a collegial environment.\" \n\nBased on feedback collected, the NSF-supported students overwhelmingly reported that this was an invaluable experience.  One chemistry student said \"there is not a single scientific conference like it.\"  The general consensus found in the participants' feedback included having the opportunity to speak with Laureates about their research, receiving inspiration and ideas, and a sense that the experience was a unique and positive opportunity that every PhD student would value.  As asserted by another chemistry student, the Lindau experience can be summarized in the following way: \"This was one of the best experiences I could have had while in graduate school.  It opened my eyes and mind to the world of possibilities in science and introduced me to students and collaborators outside of the U.S. This was an incredible networking and learning experience.\"  Another young economist supported by NSF summarized his Lindau experience: \"This was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  I came home feeling very energized about my research and like I got a great sense of where the field of economics is now and where I can help take it in the future.  I think I've made many connections with other attendees that should provide some opportunities for fruitful collaboration in the future.\"  These student comments indicate that NSF's sponsorship to the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings was incredibly valuable for the young scientists and economists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michelle Goodson"
