 "awd_abstract_narration": "1149242-Bartelt-Hunt\r\n\r\nExtracellular proteins have recently been implicated in a range of environmental engineering problems including horizontal transmission of prion diseases and the release of insecticidal toxins from transgenic plants. In addition, the increasing use of environmental proteomics necessitates a more complete understanding of the behavior of extracellular proteins in the environment. Despite this, the interactions between proteins and environmentally-relevant surfaces such as soil minerals are still poorly understood as is the influence attachment to soil can have on biologic properties of extracellular proteins. The research objective is to utilize a novel analytical tool to evaluate the interaction of one type of extracellular protein with environmentally-relevant surfaces, as well as to evaluate the subsequent changes in biologic function of the soil-attached protein. The study utilizes the new analytical tool to simultaneously investigate the amount and conformation of protein adsorbed to surfaces. In addition, the PI will perform a series of experiments to evaluate how attachment of proteins to soil can influence their biologic properties. \r\n\r\nThe information generated in this research will further understanding of the role of the environment in transmission of chronic wasting disease, an emerging animal disease that currently has no effective therapeutic treatments. Results from this study will identify how extracellular proteins interact with soils, and will inform a range of environmental engineering issues including prion disease transmission, transport of extracellular enzymes released from transgenic crops, and the behavior of proteins in soil mineral cycles. Further, the project will provide cooperative learning materials in engineering potentially leading to improved student retention in engineering, and ultimately, a more robust and diverse engineering workforce. The PI will share findings with extension educators in states impacted by prion diseases and with K-12 math and science teachers in the state of Nebraska through the University of Nebraska?s Science and Math Professional Development Summer Technology Institute. The PI will involve undergraduate students in research, and will leverage funding from an existing University of Nebraska program to provide significant undergraduate involvement in the research activities described here.",

Understanding how protein attachment behavior influences these functional changes is important for various environmental applications, including prion disease transmission.  Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that affect many animal species.  The animal prion diseases include scrapie, transmissible mink encephalopathy, chronic wasting disease (CWD), and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).  Currently, there is no treatment available for prion diseases and they are inevitably fatal.  Environmental factors may be important in the transmission of prion diseases. Prions are shed from living CWD and scrapie-infected animals into the environment through saliva, blood, urine, feces, antler velvet and birthing material.

It is likely that the environment serves as a stable reservoir of infectious CWD and scrapie prions, facilitating a sustained incidence of CWD in free-ranging animal populations and complicating efforts to eliminate disease in farmed livestock.  In this project, we investigated the influence of environmental factors such as soil wetting and drying cycles and soil freezing and thawing cycles on prion infectivity.  We found that 500 cycles of freezing and thawing reduced the ability of the prion protein to replicate during Protein Folding Cycling Amplification (PMCA), a laboratory technique that replicates the process of prion replication within an animal.

Finally, we investigated mechanisms of attachment of proteins including bovine serum albumin, alpha-synuclein, and prions, to environmental and medical surfaces.  The educational objective of this project was to develop active learning tools for use in environmental engineering undergraduate curriculum.  We developed materials for use in environmental engineering classes that use an instructional strategy called peer instruction, and we found that use of peer instruction resulted in a strong positive response from students, with over 90% recommending the use of this technique in environmental engineering courses.  Students found that peer instruction made them feel more involved in the course and to connect ideas together.  An analysis of the instructor activities in classes that were conducted with and without peer instruction indicated that peer instruction can be added into courses without substantially influencing the instructors activities in the course, meaning that there is a relatively low bar to adopting peer instruction in environmental engineering education.  Other outcomes from this program include student training, as this project provided funding for the successful completion of two Ph.D. students in environmental engineering, and resulted in a number of conference and peer-reviewed journal publications in environmental engineering and medical microbiology. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shannon L Bartelt-Hunt"
