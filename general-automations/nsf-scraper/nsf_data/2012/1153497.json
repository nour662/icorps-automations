 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two particularly important Earth processes are \"hot spot\" volcanism, where plumes of material from deep in the earth produce volcanic islands and chains such as Hawaii, Galapagos, Azores and Iceland, and the production of oceanic crust by magmatic and tectonic processes (the intrusion and eruption of melts and faulting) at mid-ocean ridges. Much about these processes remains poorly understood because they occur well below the ocean surface. Iceland is an exceptional locality where the coincidence of the Iceland Hot Spot with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge has produced exceptionally thick (25 km) crust, and brought the seafloor to the surface, where it serves as a natural laboratory, and its tectonic and geologic features can be examined in detail. This project has the aim of improving, by direct observation, a number of processes that are known to occur on mid-ocean ridges where they cannot be directly observed; among them are propagating rift zones, migrating faults and large-scale block rotations. In addition to improving our understanding of global rift processes, this project has a number of educational and other broader impacts: training for graduate and undergraduate students, international collaboration (with scientists in Iceland), and broad participation on the Syracuse University LAVA Project, and education and outreach activity.",

During the course of this project many major fault zones across iceland, previously thought to be normal faults related to subaerial seafloor spreading have been investigated in detail. It is now clear that many of these faults have experienced significant strike-slip displacements despite their rift-parallel orientations. That is, instead of faults produced by pulling Iceland apart, more or less E-W, the faults show that lateral slip (N-S) are more typical. Some of the faults may be related to the migration of transform faults linked to propagating rift zones both N and S of the hotspot located in central Iceland. However, others cannot be linked to such obvious processes. Our current hypothesis is that rift propagatoin causes the rotation of crustal blocks and that these blocks deform internally by slip on pre-existing normal faults. Thus speading-related faults are re-activated as strike-slip faults. In a few cases, later normal slip overprints the strike-slip faults. Rift propagation occurs in all extensional settings, so there are likely important implications for the evolution of continental rifts, rifted margins, and mid-ocean ridges. Reactivation of strike-slip faults also has important implications for maintaining geothermal/hydrothermal systems and earthquake hazards. These results represent a very significant departure from the current understanding of rifting processes. Iceland provides a setting in which the details of these processes can be documented for applications to other settings. The results have the potential to challenge important assumptions about faulting in more inaccessible places, such as the deep seafloor along mid-ocean ridge spreading centers.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/07/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;A&nbsp;Karson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1153497/1153497_10170199_1502120968429_Fig2tectmap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1153497/1153497_10170199_1502120968429_Fig2tectmap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tectonic Map of Iceland\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1153497/1153497_10170199_1502120968429_Fig2tectmap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tectonic Map of Iceland\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This map summarizes the results of the project.
