 "awd_abstract_narration": "How does the brain create orderly sequences of behavior?  The problem of serial order in behavior permeates human language, the ability to play a musical instrument, or any number of other activities where human or animal intent can only be effectively communicated if several behavioral gestures are chained together in a specific sequence.  How the brain accomplishes this task is currently unknown.  One approach is to use an animal model (a songbird, the zebra finch) in which the brain region responsible for the serial ordering of song syllables has been identified (called \"HVC\", the acronym is the proper name).  This project will investigate the hypothesis that the serial ordering of song syllables is mapped across several spatially-arranged chains of HVC neurons.  This hypothesis is based on preliminary data indicating that HVC neural activity is largely confined to a single spatial axis during singing.  Experiments will delineate the spatial organization of connections and electrophysiological properties of HVC neurons.  Computational models based on the properties of HVC neurons will then be used to discover network configurations that produce orderly, sequential patterns of neural activity.  Models will be validated with circuit-breaking experiments in behaving birds.  Results will provide a first look at a network architecture used by an animal brain to create order and sequence in behavior, which in turn will provide a computational platform to understand how the process of learning new behavioral sequences utilizes or shapes such architectures.  The research plan coordinates the activity of a faculty research team from three different academic departments (Psychology, Mathematics and Statistics), providing graduate and undergraduate students with access to the expertise of faculty researchers outside their home departments. Computational software tools as well as data from this project will be made available to the public at http://www.math.fsu.edu/~bertram/software/birdsong/ and at http://www.songbirdscience.com.",

The problem of serial order in behavior permeates human speech, the ability to play a musical instrument, or any number of other activities where human or animal intent can only be effectively communicated if several different behavioral gestures are chained together in a specific sequence.  To understand how the brain accomplishes this task, a multi-disciplinary research team used an animal model (a songbird, the zebra finch) where the higher brain region that encodes the serial ordering of song syllables has been identified (called \u00e6HVC\u00c6, the acronym is the proper name).  The research team combined expertise in anatomical, physiological, behavioral, and computational methods to test hypotheses about how a sequence of song syllables (e.g., A-B-C-D) is mapped spatially across the network architecture of HVC. \n\nResearch supported by this project revealed that HVC is composed of a series of parallel chains of interconnected neurons, distributed across the medial-lateral axis of HVC (Stauffer et al. 2012, Basista et al. 2014).  In other words, HVC is not composed of a single interconnected network of neurons (as believed previously), but several subpopulations organized as a succession of parallel chains.  To determine how individual elements of song might be mapped across this highly parallel architecture, medial vs. lateral portions of HVC were inactivated in singing birds.  Songs were analyzed in an unbiased fashion using computer software developed by the research team (Daou et al. 2012).  Results showed that the lateral portions of HVC are necessary to encode individual syllables whereas the medial portions of HVC are necessary to encode the sequence in which individual syllables are produced (Basista et al. 2014).  While parallel encoding of syllables and their sequence has been long been theorized to underlie the production of human speech patterns, these are the first experimental data to demonstrate such an architecture in any animal brain.  The research team also developed behavioral evidence suggesting that the highly organized architecture of HVC may fail to form when the learning of song is disrupted (Elliott et al. 2014).  Lastly, the team devised and validated biophysical mathematical models for each of the three different types of neurons found within each chain of HVC neurons (Daou et al. 2013).  Using computer simulation, the model neurons were then connected in a variety of prototype networks.  The team identified a network that replicates the parallel architecture of HVC and generates a sequential pattern of neural activity that mirrors the sequential structure of song (Bertram et al. 2014). \n\nDuring the course of this project the research team also developed several new activities designed to strengthen the infrastructure and public appreciation of science.  This included interdisciplinary training opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as the creation of a new graduate course in Computational Neuroscience that was offered through the FSU Program in Neuroscience.  The research team was also active in the local community &ndash; in two different years (2012, 2014) the team developed and taught community-based courses on Brain and Behavior that were targeted to older adult (50+) citizens, a science-education constituency that is often overlooked and underserved.  All graduate student members of the research team also participated in the lectures and demonstrations.  Finally, computer software and biophysical mathematical models developed during this project were made freely available to any interested party at www.math.fsu.edu/~bertram/software/birdsong.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/14/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James F Johnson"
