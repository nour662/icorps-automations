Accepted extended abstracts will be published as a volume in the Springer Verlag's Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics series, while short abstracts will be published online and on CD-ROM. In addition to contributed abstracts, the technical program will include tutorials, panel discussions, and poster sessions, and will feature invited keynote talks by distinguished researchers in the field. Full versions of selected abstracts presented at the symposium will be invited to peer-reviewed special issues of IEEE/ ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics and BMC Bioinformatics. The symposium provides ample opportunities for interaction between researchers with complementary expertise thus fostering new collaborations.",
