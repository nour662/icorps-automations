 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ghana Grid Computing School will be held at Kwame Nkrunah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in Kumasi, Ghana, August 6-8, 2012. The school will be led by DOSAR, the Distributed Organization of Scientific and Academic Research, which has partnered successfully in the past with institutions in Brazil and South Africa to establish customized grid sites and conduct tutorials on grid applications and operation. The school program will be aimed primarily at doctoral students and on students finishing their last year of university studies, but young researchers will also be encouraged to apply. This school will serve as an opportunity for US students and professional physicists to interact with their counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa and to form collaborations and partnerships in the domain of Grid Computing, which is central to the analysis of several large-scale experiments with world-wide collaborations, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.  The school will make use of Open Science Grid computing software infrastructure that has been developed with U.S. funding agency support (including NSF: PHY/PIF and OCI.  The grid computing technology harnesses available computing resources and can be immediately used for other areas of scientific research and education, in addition to a wide range of sectors in society as a whole.  The program is supported jointly by NSF Division of Physics, through its programs in Elementary Particle Physics Experiment and Education and Interdisciplinary Research, and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering through its Global Venture Fund.",
