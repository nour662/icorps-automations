 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dennard's scaling, which governs the growth of power, voltage and frequency of CMOS integrated chips, has been as instrumental as Moore's law in enabling the exponential growth of the number of active transistors on a chip. Unfortunately, the recent slowing down of Dennard's scaling of the supply voltage in future multicores may result in dark silicon where an increasing number of cores must be kept powered down due to lack of power. One alternative is to improve power efficiency by customizing the cores for specific functionalities. While the dark silicon option obviously degrades performance, the customization option puts multicores on a potentially arduous path of increased effort for hardware design, verification, and test, and degraded programmability. The challenge that architects face is to design around the reality of the slowing of Dennard's scaling while avoiding either of the two harsh consequences (dark silicon, or the increased cost/effort of customized core design).\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the above challenge by pursuing an alternative, gentle (i.e., non-arduous) path for multicore scaling, while remaining within the power envelope imposed by the slowing of Dennard's scaling. The design employs successive frequency unscaling, where all the cores are kept powered and run at successively slower clocks every generation to stay within the power budget.  An analytical model (developed as part of this project) for the performance of systems with and without successive frequency unscaling makes the surprising prediction that despite considerably slower clocks in later generations (e.g., sub-GHz), successive frequency unscaling would exceed the dark silicon performance limit. The key research goal of this project is to validate the predictions of the model with real applications and detailed system simulation. Validating an alternative, gentle path for multicore scaling has the potential to offer significant benefits for the microprocessor and computer industry. Beyond the research impacts, the project's integration of education components in both graduate and undergraduate curricula helps expand its educational impact.",
