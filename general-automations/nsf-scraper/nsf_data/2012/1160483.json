VIRGINIA, FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIV., KOREA\r\nADVANCED INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, TOKYO INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, UNIV. ADELAIDE\r\n\r\nThe vision of ASSIST is to use nanotechnology to improve global health by enabling correlation between personal health and personal environment and by empowering patients and doctors to manage wellness and improve quality of life. ASSIST's nano-enabled energy harvesting, energy storage, nanoscale transistors and sensors will produce innovative, self-powered, wearable health monitoring systems that provide long-term sensing to enable effective management of chronic conditions and improve quality of life outcomes. ASSIST will advance environmental health research and policy and strengthen clinical trials. This vision, guided by industry partners, environmental/social scientists, and medical practitioners, will address the NAE Grand Challenge of Advanced Health Informatics.\r\n\r\nThe mission of ASSIST is to transform U.S. and global health informatics, electronics, and biomedical engineering industries through development of enabling nanotechnologies for energy harvesting, battery-free energy storage, and ultra-low power computation and communication, integrated with physiological and ambient nanosensors and biocompatible materials, to empower personal environmental health monitoring and emergency response. ASSIST goals are to:\r\n\r\n-Advance discovery through fundamental knowledge and innovative solutions in human body energy harvesting and energy storage based on thermoelectrics, piezoelectrics and supercapacitors.\r\n\r\n-Leverage nanostructured materials/structures to improve system energy efficiency orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\n-Demonstrate wearable, reliable, low power, non-invasive sensors for health and environment and develop robust techniques for heterogeneous and hierarchical systems integration.\r\n\r\n-Design intelligent power management for battery-free sensing, computation, and communication.\r\n\r\n-Develop systems integration requirements, incorporating research on human and social factors, and demonstrate Exposure Tracking and Wellness Tracking testbeds.\r\n\r\n-Create a culture of team-based research, education, and innovation, employing a diverse group focused on research, design, and production of solutions and systems for health and safety.\r\n\r\nForm partnerships with precollege institutions to strengthen the STEM pipeline and promote technical literacy and motivation to contribute to solving NAE Grand Challenges.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: ASSIST's research on high-efficiency nanostructured, flexible thermoelectrics and nanodomain piezoelectrics will enhance harvested power levels from the human body while novel nanostructured electrodes will increase the storage density of capacitors. Exploration of nanoscale quantum well and quantum wire structures coupled with strain engineering will enhance the performance and reduce the energy consumption of advanced CMOS devices. Precise atomic scale control of heterostructured interfaces will significantly improve the energy efficiency of complementary inter-band tunnel transistors. Investigation of novel sensing modalities enabled by nanomaterials, will significantly reduce power levels and increase functionality of self-powered systems. For example, nanoenabled dry adhesives, nano-hydrogel composites, nanowires, nanomembranes and nano-enabled materials for enhanced light absorption and detection will result in high performance sensors. ASSIST will integrate these technologies into systems with intelligent power management strategies using hierarchical integration from nanoscale materials and devices to the human body interface.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Direct correlation of individual environmental exposure to health response for understanding impacts on chronic conditions (e.g., asthma, allergies, heart disease, autoimmune disease); Long-term sensing of critical environmental triggers and health vitals, leading to unprecedented data/tools for public health research and clinical trials; Enhanced understanding of onset and progression of disease and its effective management; Better informed environmental health regulatory policymaking; New tools for disaster emergency response; More rapid diagnosis and improved treatment effectiveness; Strengthened STEM pipeline to engineering careers through intensive school partnerships; Enhanced public science literacy and diversity of U.S. engineering graduates.",

ASSIST envisions self-powered wearables that deliver integrated health and exposure monitoring, offering actionable insights for users and their healthcare providers.</p>\n<p>ASSIST&rsquo;s mission is to develop leading-edge systems for high-value applications such as healthcare and Internet of Things (IOT) by integrating fundamental advances in energy harvesting, low-power electronics, and sensors with a focus on usability and actionable data. ASSIST does this by bringing together multidisciplinary researchers, practitioners, and industry partners in a diverse and inclusive ecosystem that encourages innovation with a focus on education and outreach.</p>\n<p>ASSIST was established by a consortium of faculty and researchers from NC State University, Penn State University, University of Virginia, Florida International University, University of Michigan, University of Utah and University of Texas at Austin.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit Outcomes:</strong></p>\n<p>ASSIST demonstrated two testbeds (Health and Exposure Tracker and Self-Powered Adaptable Platform) to transform health informatics, electronics, and biomedical engineering by empowering personal health and environmental monitoring through developing nanotechnologies for energy harvesting, battery-free energy storage, and ultra-low-power computation/communication, and integrating low power physiological and environmental nano-sensors using biocompatible materials.</p>\n<p>The Center developed several new technologies, some up to mid TRL (Technology Readiness Level), in diverse health applications, including asthma, vigilant cardiac monitoring, diet management, wound monitoring/ healing, medication adherence, aging, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease/Dementia, sleep and stress monitoring as well as cough, speech, gait and fall detection. 10+ Institutional Review Board approved preclinical studies demonstrated the potential of ASSIST wearables. To-date, there have been 90+ inventions disclosed, 50+ patents filed, and 20+ patents granted.</p>\n<p>The innovation productivity remains strong with 10 spin-off companies launched by ASSIST faculty and students, with additional licenses issued to 3 outside companies. One of these startups has raised $150M+ to-date (post money valuation up to $500M+).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact Outcomes:</strong></p>\n<p>Over its lifetime, ASSIST graduated 100+ undergraduates, 30+ master&rsquo;s and 100+ doctoral students. Approximately 40% of the graduates have gone on to industry careers, many of them making significant contributions in ASSIST-related fields at major companies. ASSIST&rsquo;s pre-college education programs included the Wearable Device Challenge (WDC), Young Scholars, Research Experience for Teachers &amp; Young Scholars programs, as well as summer camps for middle/high schoolers. To-date, the Center sponsored 40+ Capstone/Senior Design projects, 110+ REUs, and 500+ WDC participants. ASSIST demonstrated a growing educational pipeline with students, participating in the WDC, joining our Young Scholar Programs, then coming back as REU students and continuing to graduate studies.</p>\n<p>The multidisciplinary minor program in Nanoscience and Technology at NC State University was launched during the Center&rsquo;s third year and has remained active since. ASSIST educators introduced 20+ new courses based on ASSIST content, including one course available on NanoHub. ASSIST faculty authored 10+ textbooks or book chapters. The faculty members continued to excel in research and teaching and have won several teaching awards.</p>\n<p>ASSIST continued to enhance value for the innovation ecosystem through organizing semi-annual industry days, workshops (e.g. on implantable electronics), symposia (e.g., on energy harvesting), conferences (e.g., molecular recognition), industry-centric training, and weekly seminars, as well as promoting key research summaries through annual Research Portfolio publications publicly available online. ASSIST worked with 100+ industry members and partners to-date and continues to grow its network.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Post NSF Sustainability Direction:</strong></p>\n<p>ASSIST has leveraged the momentum built under NSF funding to continue to advance research in diagnostic and therapeutic devices, through deploying outreach to recruit new faculty and researchers to the Center, using the ERC outcomes as preliminary data to apply for large grants with these researchers from recently established federal agencies with a focus on translation to the field (e.g., NSF TIP Directorate, IARPA, ARPA-H), strengthening the industry program even further towards self-sufficiency, and expanding into new markets and application space through establishing a new Institute at NC State University (<em>Institute of Connected Sensor Systems</em> (IConS)). ASSIST Physiological Assessment Lab and Prototyping Facility also serve industry members and academic community.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since graduation from NSF, ASSIST has engaged and pursued hundreds of large companies, start-ups, and organizations, in the MedTech, AI, Textiles and Photonics areas, among others, for potential collaborations. ASSIST has also built partnerships with incubators, investors as well as other research organizations. Using membership funds, ASSIST continues to offer seed grants for proposals, selected with Industry Advisory Board inputs, to fuel even more funding from federal and industry funding resources.</p>\n<p>For a collective brainstorming on ERC sustainability, ASSIST organized an ERC-Wide Workshop in 2024, with participation from all ERCs to engage and share information about their use-inspired and translational research activities, as well as learn about relevant programs, at NSF especially under the TIP Directorate, for post-graduation sustainability. The Workshop Report is available on the ASSIST website.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/14/2024<br>\nModified by: Alper&nbsp;Bozkurt</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nVision and Mission Statements:\n\n\nNSF Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Advanced Self-Powered Systems of Integrated Sensors and Technologies (ASSIST) focuses on creating self-powered sensing, computing, and communication systems to enable data-driven insights for a smart and healthy world. ASSIST envisions self-powered wearables that deliver integrated health and exposure monitoring, offering actionable insights for users and their healthcare providers.\n\n\nASSISTs mission is to develop leading-edge systems for high-value applications such as healthcare and Internet of Things (IOT) by integrating fundamental advances in energy harvesting, low-power electronics, and sensors with a focus on usability and actionable data. ASSIST does this by bringing together multidisciplinary researchers, practitioners, and industry partners in a diverse and inclusive ecosystem that encourages innovation with a focus on education and outreach.\n\n\nASSIST was established by a consortium of faculty and researchers from NC State University, Penn State University, University of Virginia, Florida International University, University of Michigan, University of Utah and University of Texas at Austin.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual Merit Outcomes:\n\n\nASSIST demonstrated two testbeds (Health and Exposure Tracker and Self-Powered Adaptable Platform) to transform health informatics, electronics, and biomedical engineering by empowering personal health and environmental monitoring through developing nanotechnologies for energy harvesting, battery-free energy storage, and ultra-low-power computation/communication, and integrating low power physiological and environmental nano-sensors using biocompatible materials.\n\n\nThe Center developed several new technologies, some up to mid TRL (Technology Readiness Level), in diverse health applications, including asthma, vigilant cardiac monitoring, diet management, wound monitoring/ healing, medication adherence, aging, Alzheimers disease/Dementia, sleep and stress monitoring as well as cough, speech, gait and fall detection. 10+ Institutional Review Board approved preclinical studies demonstrated the potential of ASSIST wearables. To-date, there have been 90+ inventions disclosed, 50+ patents filed, and 20+ patents granted.\n\n\nThe innovation productivity remains strong with 10 spin-off companies launched by ASSIST faculty and students, with additional licenses issued to 3 outside companies. One of these startups has raised $150M+ to-date (post money valuation up to $500M+).\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impact Outcomes:\n\n\nOver its lifetime, ASSIST graduated 100+ undergraduates, 30+ masters and 100+ doctoral students. Approximately 40% of the graduates have gone on to industry careers, many of them making significant contributions in ASSIST-related fields at major companies. ASSISTs pre-college education programs included the Wearable Device Challenge (WDC), Young Scholars, Research Experience for Teachers & Young Scholars programs, as well as summer camps for middle/high schoolers. To-date, the Center sponsored 40+ Capstone/Senior Design projects, 110+ REUs, and 500+ WDC participants. ASSIST demonstrated a growing educational pipeline with students, participating in the WDC, joining our Young Scholar Programs, then coming back as REU students and continuing to graduate studies.\n\n\nThe multidisciplinary minor program in Nanoscience and Technology at NC State University was launched during the Centers third year and has remained active since. ASSIST educators introduced 20+ new courses based on ASSIST content, including one course available on NanoHub. ASSIST faculty authored 10+ textbooks or book chapters. The faculty members continued to excel in research and teaching and have won several teaching awards.\n\n\nASSIST continued to enhance value for the innovation ecosystem through organizing semi-annual industry days, workshops (e.g. on implantable electronics), symposia (e.g., on energy harvesting), conferences (e.g., molecular recognition), industry-centric training, and weekly seminars, as well as promoting key research summaries through annual Research Portfolio publications publicly available online. ASSIST worked with 100+ industry members and partners to-date and continues to grow its network.\n\n\n\n\n\nPost NSF Sustainability Direction:\n\n\nASSIST has leveraged the momentum built under NSF funding to continue to advance research in diagnostic and therapeutic devices, through deploying outreach to recruit new faculty and researchers to the Center, using the ERC outcomes as preliminary data to apply for large grants with these researchers from recently established federal agencies with a focus on translation to the field (e.g., NSF TIP Directorate, IARPA, ARPA-H), strengthening the industry program even further towards self-sufficiency, and expanding into new markets and application space through establishing a new Institute at NC State University (Institute of Connected Sensor Systems (IConS)). ASSIST Physiological Assessment Lab and Prototyping Facility also serve industry members and academic community.\n\n\nSince graduation from NSF, ASSIST has engaged and pursued hundreds of large companies, start-ups, and organizations, in the MedTech, AI, Textiles and Photonics areas, among others, for potential collaborations. ASSIST has also built partnerships with incubators, investors as well as other research organizations. Using membership funds, ASSIST continues to offer seed grants for proposals, selected with Industry Advisory Board inputs, to fuel even more funding from federal and industry funding resources.\n\n\nFor a collective brainstorming on ERC sustainability, ASSIST organized an ERC-Wide Workshop in 2024, with participation from all ERCs to engage and share information about their use-inspired and translational research activities, as well as learn about relevant programs, at NSF especially under the TIP Directorate, for post-graduation sustainability. The Workshop Report is available on the ASSIST website.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AlperBozkurt\n"
