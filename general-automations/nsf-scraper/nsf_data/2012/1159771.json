 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite considerable progress made in developing microfluidic\r\ntechnologies for biological analysis, including droplet microfluidics to enable scalable partitioning of fluid\r\ninto tiny compartments for single cell analysis, transforming the technology into practical applications are\r\nstill hindered by 1) inadequate macro-to-micro interface to cope with large volume biological samples\r\ncontaining complex matrix; 2) complicated post-PCR processing for multiplexed, broad-scale genotypic\r\nanalysis; and 3) insufficient progress toward system integration.\r\nIn this project, we plan to develop a fully integrated micro total analysis system (&#56256;&#56861;TAS) for high\r\nthroughput broad-scale microbial detection and genotypic identification from a mixed population at single\r\ncell resolution. Our novel platform will incorporate a microfluidic droplet generator to encapsulate single\r\nbacterial cells into a large quantity of pL-sized droplets where the cells are lysed and enzymatic reactions\r\ntake place to facilitate high throughput single cell PCR amplification. For broad-scale bacterial detection\r\nand species identification, we will incorporate a previously validated 16S rRNA PCR assay coupled with\r\nhigh resolution melt analysis (HRMA) for amplicon sequence analysis. This platform will not only provide\r\nhighly accurate quantification of bacterial load, but the incorporation of HRMA at the single cell level\r\npermits both broad-scale species identification, as well as unprecedented resolution in measuring relative\r\nabundance of bacterial species present in a mixed population.",
