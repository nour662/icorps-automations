A second panel will present a microscopic view of the natural world ? a view typically seen only by research scientists. The third panel will be placed between the macro and micro panels. It will present an ?in-between? view of the landscape that ranges from 3 feet to 15 feet in total area. Aspects of the macro and the micro images will be intertwined or layered with this image to create a seamless connection between the broad view and the microscopic view\r\n\r\n",
