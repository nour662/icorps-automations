 "awd_abstract_narration": "For fifty years, the Tibetan Plateau has been recognized as the largest topographic feature that perturbs atmospheric circulation.  It serves as an ideal field laboratory for understanding the geodynamic processes that build high terrain.  Accordingly, the growth of the plateau should have altered atmospheric circulation and therefore written an evolving paleoclimatic signature not only on eastern Asian regional climates, but on global climate as well.  Despite many recent studies, we still do not know precisely when the Tibetan Plateau reached its current dimensions and how it perturbs atmospheric circulation.  This project brings together geodynamicists, atmospheric scientists, and paleoclimatologists in a multidisciplinary study of the when and the how.\r\n\r\nOne of the major goals of the project is to quantify the extent to which Tibet has grown by crustal thickening, by thrust faulting and folding, by flow within the crust that redistributes material there, or by replacement of cold mantle lithosphere with hotter material (all in a state of isostatic equilibrium). Such quantification will take big steps toward the understanding of how high plateaus are built and how continental lithosphere deforms, topics at the forefront of geodynamics. \r\n\r\nDetermining how Tibet has grown will require determining when crustal shortening and thickening occurred, using basic field methods and modern laboratory techniques, and quantifying paleoaltitudes with new isotopic tools. Applying such paleoaltimetric techniques, however, requires an understanding not only of how the atmosphere transports isotopes, but how the evolving high terrain affected surface temperatures at times in the past.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of the project is to understand the role of the Tibetan Plateau in determining summer precipitation regimes in Asia.  The classical definition of \"monsoon\" describes a shift in wind directions, not in precipitation regimes.  Precipitation is linked to convection, which could be determined by local buoyancy or by low-level convergence of the winds.  Even though the Indian summer monsoon and the East Asian summer monsoon are both called \"monsoons\", their dynamics and hence the characteristics of precipitation are very different.   \n\nIn this study, we demonstrate that the Indian and East Asian summer monsoons co-vary in July and August, when they share the same moisture source, the Bay of Bengal.  The moisture-laden winds from the Bay of Bengal diverge at the southern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, with a westward branch bringing moisture to the Himalayan foothills, and an eastward branch bringing moisture over the Yunnan Plateau to East Asia.   \n\nWe also show that the year-to-year variations in summer frontal precipitation over East Asia are related to the variations in the position of the westerly jet stream in the upper troposphere.  In the current climate, the westerly jet is south of the Tibetan Plateau in the spring and early summer, and migrates to north of the Plateau in mid-to-late summer.  A more northward migration of the westerly jet in the summer means an earlier transition from spring rains to Meiyu frontal precipitation. \n\nWe show in a model calculation that linkage between the Indian and East Asian summer monsoons is robust during the Last Glacial Maximum, and is supported by the speleothem record in southwest China.  We also hypothesize that the linkage between the westerly jet and East Asian summer monsoon precipitation works in past climates as well. \n\nThe study provides an insight into the influence of topography on changing patterns of atmospheric circulation and precipitation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/24/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Inez Fung"
