 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Macrofungi Collection Consortium: Unlocking a Biodiversity Resource for Understanding Biotic Interactions, Nutrient Cycling and Human Affairs\r\n\r\nMushrooms and related fungi (macrofungi) play a critical role in the lives of plants and animals, including humans, yet their diversity is underestimated. Understanding this diversity will be critical in analyzing impacts of habitat change, nutrient cycling in ecosystems, and distributions and diversity of host organisms.   Scientists in the U.S. have been studying these fungi for the past 150 years, resulting in a legacy of approximately 1.4 million dried scientific specimens conserved in 35 institutions in 24 states.  These institutions have now joined in an effort to digitize and share online all data associated with macrofungi specimens.  The resulting resource will enable a national census of macrofungi, never before attempted, and will allow researchers to better understand the diversity of these organisms and the relationship between macrofungi and the organisms with which they form intimate relationships.\r\n\r\nOrganized into clubs across the country, citizen mycologists play an important role in documenting macrofungi diversity, and these enthusiastic individuals are the conduit between professional scientists and the general public for critical information about wild edible and poisonous fungi.  Citizen mycologists will join the collections institutions in this project to help to create the on-line resource.  The project will fund two workshops for high school teachers to promote classroom study of fungi.  University students employed by the project will gain work experience in digitization and formal training about fungi.  Students will share the knowledge they gain through oral and video presentations. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

Outreach to the amateur community has been a major component of the Macrofungi digitization project, including numerous tours, lectures and training sessions about how to prepare voucher specimens and how to use the MycoPortal for club or individual projects.\n\nTo summarize the contents of the data on macrofungi in the MycoPortal, approximately 73% of the specimens are from North America; 18% are from central America, South America and the Caribbean region; 5% are from Europe, 2% were for each of Northern and Southern and Australasia, and 1% from Africa.

The need for an effort to document the phenotypes as well as genotypes of North American fungi was first articulated in 2011, and a workshop of 75 professional and amateur mycologists was convened to explore the topic in 2012.  Many details of the proposed Mycoflora of North America were not explored in depth, but those assembled agreed on the need for collection, sequencing and vouchering of specimens by amateur clubs as well as professionals and students.   Since 2012, at least 14 amateur clubs have embarked on projects to obtain DNA sequences from their collections, and to create voucher specimens.  Clubs make arrangements with laboratories to obtain sequences, and the cost of sequencing comes from club dues.  So far the effort has been largely uncoordinated, but a 2017 reboot of the Mycoflora project promises a more formal collaboration between amateur and professional mycologists that will build upon the data and tools available in the MycoPortal to characterize and distinguish the fungi of North America more effectively.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/20/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barbara M Thiers"
