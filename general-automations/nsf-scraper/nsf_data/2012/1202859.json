 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physiological role and biochemical mechanism of bacterial manganese(II) oxidation\r\n\r\nAs one of the most abundant transition metals in the earth's crust, manganese is prevalent in biological systems.  It is found in superoxide dismutase, the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II, and it plays an important role in biogeochemical cycling of carbon, sulfur, and several trace elements.  Some microbes can even oxidize Mn(II), transforming it to Mn(III) and Mn(IV) oxides.  Although bacterial Mn(II) oxidation is thought to be ubiquitous in nature, its physiological role remains poorly understood.  Recently, researchers identified two putative Mn(II) oxidase genes, mnxG and mcoA, in the organisms Pseudomonas putida GB-1 and Bacillus sp. SG-1.  The proteins are predicted to be multicopper oxidases, a family of Cu-containing enzymes that couples oxidation of metal or organic substrates to reduction of dioxygen.  This project will use a combination of molecular and spectroscopic techniques to investigate both possible physiological roles for bacterial Mn(II) oxidation, and the enzymes that mediate this process.  \r\n\r\nThis research will teach the fellow a variety of biological, environmental, and chemical techniques, allowing her to pursue an independent research career after she completes her post-doctoral training.  Additionally, she will volunteer with several ongoing outreach efforts in the laboratory of her sponsor.  In particular, she will work with the NSF Science and Technology Center for Coastal Margin Observation and Prediction (CMOP) to provide undergraduate internships and K-12 educational programs.  She will also mentor students in the laboratory and teach summer school classes through the Saturday Academy (www.saturdayacademy.org).  She aims to provide young students with hands-on training in environmental microbiology.",

These biogeochemical processes include Mn(II) oxidation to Mn(III) and Mn(IV) oxides, a reaction that can be mediated by microbes. Although bacterial Mn(II) oxidation is thought to be ubiquitous in nature, the process is poorly understood.  In particular, we do not yet understand why microorganisms mediate this process.\n\n            Our lab has hypothesized that Mn oxidation may help microbes respond to oxidative stress, given that manganese plays a strong role in how other organisms respond to reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Mn is a key component of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and some catalases, and Mn and its complexes with cellular metabolites have also been shown to possess dismutase activity. \n\n            The relationship between oxidative stress and manganese oxidation is being examined using two bacteria: Pseudomonas putida GB-1 and Bacillus sp. PL-12.  Pseudomonas putida GB-1 is a genetically tractable bacterium that has served as a model organism for research on biological manganese oxidation, and Bacillus sp. PL-12 is a spore- forming microorganism from which a manganese oxidase, MnxG, has been successfully purified. \n\nI. Survival Experiments \n\n            To examine the interaction between manganese oxidation and oxidative stress, survival experiments were performed in which cultures of P. putida GB-1 were treated with either hydrogen peroxide or buffer.  The cultures were grown overnight, serially diluted, and then plated to determine whether the cultures treated with peroxide were less likely to survive than their buffer &ndash; only counterparts.  The data indicate that strains of P. putida GB-1 lacking the mcoA gene that are treated with H2O2 develop consistently fewer CFUs than when treated with buffer.  This trend is not observed consistently in WT and &Delta;mnxG strains.\n\nII. Characterization of Mnx protein complex \n\n   Another aspect of my research has involved characterizing the Mnx complex, a large protein complex that is the Mn(II) oxidase in bacterial spores of Bacillus sp. PL-12. This complex is comprised of three proteins: MnxG, MnxF, and MnxE. The largest protein in the complex, MnxG, is a multicopper oxidase (MCO) enzyme.\n\n   With the help of many collaborators, I have characterized this enzyme complex using a variety of approaches.  1) Mutagenesis experiments have identified specific amino acid residues in MnxG that are important for Mn(II) oxidation.  2) Mnx complex stoichiometry and quaternary structure were established by Transmisson Electron Microscopy and Mass Spectrometry.  3) Spectroscopic approaches are investigating the Mnx complex at various stages of the reaction to look for potential intermediates.  These data suggest that the MnxG protein probably shares many active site features with other MCO enzymes, but the Mnx complex is novel amongst MCO enzymes in both structure and kinetic mechanism.\n\n    Several site-directed mutants of this enzyme are illustrated in figure 2.  They exhibited changes in color and rates of manganese oxidation (figures 3, 4 respectively).  The structure was obtained with I-Tasser modeling software.\n\n    Experiments to determine the shape and quaternary structure are diagrammed in figures 5 and 6.  Figure 5 depicts high resolution transmission electron microscopy images of the Mnx complex particles and particles of the MnxEF subunits.  Figure 6 documents a mass spectrometry experiment that led to the proposed quaternary structure of the complex.\n\nConclusions \n\n     My research activities thus far have determined that cultures of Pseudomonas putida GB-1 can form different Mn oxidation biofilm phenotypes in the presence of ROS generating species and ROS scavengers.  I have also demonstrated that str..."
