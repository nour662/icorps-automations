 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports the research Professors Judith C. Chow, Lung-Wen Anton Chen and Douglas H Lowenthal who submitted an International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) proposal. They seek to better understand the chemical nature of brown carbon (BrC) and address the hypotheses regarding BrC sources through an international collaboration between U.S. and German researchers. Brown carbon is a special class of light-absorbing organic matter in atmospheric aerosols that has direct and indirect effects on the Earth's radiation balance. BrC is believed to derive from the oxidation and/or oligomerization of organic compounds in biomass burning plumes and photochemically-formed secondary organic aerosol. This project improves understanding of the BrC's chemical nature and its sources by perfecting and applying a new measurement method. This method combines thermal/optical characterization of source and ambient aerosol samples with mass spectroscopic detection of the evolved gases using soft and hard ionization methods. A thermal/optical carbon analyzer developed at the Desert Research Institute (DRI) is enhanced for multi-elemental and spectral detection with photo-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MS) developed at the University of Rostock (UR) in Germany. BrC and black carbon (BC) can then be quantified from spectral light absorption measurements and studied with molecular patterns/source signatures in gases evolved at different temperatures. The relationship of BrC to organic groups, particularly carboxyls observed in higher temperature fractions (likely originating from high-MW polycarboxylic acids), will be investigated. A library consisting of two-dimensional MS-thermograms for major aerosol types, including laboratory-generated model aerosols, real-world fresh and aged source emissions, and source mixtures from urban and non-urban environments will be established. This library will facilitate source attribution when coupled with advanced chemometric analyses. The derived profiles can be applied to global emission inventories that currently contain only a BC component for modeling the global radiation balance.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this study include: 1) increasing academic exchanges between U.S. and German universities; 2) training doctoral candidates in both countries to enhance the environmental workforce; 3) research experiences for environmental science instructors from Nevada high schools and community colleges; and 4) improving the ability to better model effects of BC and BrC as short-term climate forcers by improving their regional and global emission estimates.",

Brown carbon (BrC) is a class of light-absorbing organic matter that absorbs little light in the infrared (IR) range but much radiation near the ultraviolet (UV) range, giving a yellow or brown appearance to aerosol deposits containing BrC. BrC and black carbon (BC) have adverse effects on human health, visibility, and the Earth&rsquo;s radiation balance. Current knowledge is limited about BrC molecular composition, chemical and optical properties, and sources, partially due to limited measurement options to quantify and characterize BrC. This research has developed new measurement methods to better understand the chemical nature and pollution sources of BrC through an international collaboration between U.S. and German researchers. The project consists of two primary components: (1) development of new instruments to characterize BrC; and (2) study of the optical and chemical properties of BrC from ambient and source samples.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project led to successful development, evaluation, and implementation of four instruments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DRI Model 2015 Multiwavelength Thermal/Optical Carbon Analyzer</strong>. This instrument (Figure 2), as an improvement of the conventional single-wavelength thermal/optical carbon analyzer,&nbsp;measures reflectance and transmittance at seven wavelengths from UV to IR&nbsp;throughout thermal/optical analysis of ambient and source samples. In addition to organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), it reports contributions of BrC and BC to light absorption at each wavelength, allowing a better understanding of pollution sources and atmospheric formation of BrC (Figure 3). This instrument has been commercialized and the technology has been transferred to over 30 laboratories worldwide.</li>\n<li><strong>Thermal/optical analysis with quadrupole mass spectrometer (TOA-QMS)</strong>. This instrument analyzes thermally evolved species from filter samples by a specific detector (i.e., QMS with electron ionization [EI]). It allows major aerosol components (i.e., ammonium, sulfate, nitrate, and organic carbon) as well as ratios of oxygen/carbon (O/C), hydrogen/carbon (H/C), and organic matter/organic carbon (OM/OC) to be estimated. An example thermogram and mass spectrum for a birch log burning sample is shown in Figure 4. </li>\n<li><strong>Thermal elemental analyzer</strong>. This instrument determines major elements (i.e., C, H, N, S, and O) on filter samples. Due to its higher sensitivity than commercial instrument, it can find applications in fields other than environmental analysis (e.g., pharmaceutical, material, and food science). </li>\n<li><strong>TOA-EI/REMPI/SPI-TOFMS system</strong>.<strong> </strong>To better understand the atmospheric carbon composition, the multiwavelength carbon analyzer was integrated with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) using three ionization techniques: EI, resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI), and single photon ionization (SPI). The different ionization techniques fragment molecules to different levels, allowing different OC and BrC species and markers of different pollution sources to be identified simultaneously.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BrC was characterized for both ambient and source samples.</p>\n<p>For ambient samples, the DRI Model 2015 analyzer is currently measuring carbonaceous aerosols from the U.S. Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) and the Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network since January 2016. On average, non-urban IMPROVE samples show higher BrC fractions of short-wavelength absorption than urban CSN samples, indicating greater influence from biomass burning and aged aerosols at non-urban environment, as well as higher primary BC contributions from engine exhaust at urban areas. For sampling sites impacted by wildfires, the different BrC and BC fractions provide an indication of the nature of the fire events (e.g., smoldering&nbsp;versus&nbsp;flaming combustions).</p>\n<p>For source samples, BrC emissions from peat combustion were characterized. The mean OC emission factors were 3.8&ndash;16.6 g/kg fuel, with mass absorption efficiencies ranging 0.2&ndash;0.8 m<sup>2</sup>/g at 405 nm and reduced sharply to 0.03&ndash;0.07m<sup>2</sup>/g at 532 nm. The average absorption &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m exponent (AAE) was 9 as compared to commonly applied AAE of one for BC. The strong absorption in the UV and shorter visible wavelengths by BrC may result in the positive net forcing (warming) over bright surfaces. BrC's impact on climate may be larger than expected due to extensive peat combustion activities worldwide. Partition of organic compounds from peat combustion emissions in gas and particle phases based on their volatility were also studied. Methoxy phenols and C6&ndash;C10 alkanoic acids have the highest gas-phase mass emissions factors, while levoglucosan is the most abundant particle-phase semi-volatile organic compound. In addition, TOA-REMPI/SPI-TOFMS measurements of wood combustion emission and smog chamber samples indicate that ion species with mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 60, 70, 73, and 98 are good indicators for biomass burning (Figure 5) while ions with m/z of 58 and 82 are characteristic&nbsp;of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) from terpenes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Judith&nbsp;C&nbsp;Chow</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1214163/1214163_10215034_1511984177714_Fig.2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1214163/1214163_10215034_1511984177714_Fig.2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1214163/1214163_10215034_1511984177714_Fig.2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2.
