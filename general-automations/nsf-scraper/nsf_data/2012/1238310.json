 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed planning activity seeks to undertake planning of the establishment of a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) site at Indiana University of the existing Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing. The center currently involves Arizona, Florida, Mississippi State and Rutgers, and industry and government partners in the field. The Indiana University site intends to provide additional capabilities for the center to cover the areas of basic cloud infrastructure including tools to support the FutureGrid testbed, security, networking, storage, programming models and applications. The site intends to explore the utility of clouds to support scientific research including infrastructure tools and development of innovations in extensions of the MapReduce programming model, identification of science applications suitable for clouds, privacy preserving algorithms for health informatics on clouds, integration of high performance networking and data architectures.\r\n\r\nThe planned site, in combination with the existing center plans to help build innovation capacity in cloud computing and its supporting science and engineering through cooperatively defined research on key challenges with industry.  The outcomes from the center have the potential to broadly impact the public and private sectors. The site plans to have a significant impact on curriculum and student training at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The planned site intends to actively engage in outreach to Minority Serving Institutions through existing consortia.",
