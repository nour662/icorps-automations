 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project entitled - Emerging Researchers National Conference in STEM - will hold a student research conference with selected programs of the National Science Foundation Human Resources Development and Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) programs in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. The conference will include undergraduate and graduate students from the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology, Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate, Research in Disabilities Education, Tribal Colleges and Universities Programs and the REUs.  In terms of advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning, students will participate in undergraduate and graduate student poster and oral presentations. Topics covered at the three-day conference as part of plenary and workshop sessions will focus on applying for and persisting in graduate schools; identifying graduate school fellowships and financial aid; identifying, interviewing for, and persisting in STEM careers in all employment sectors; and understanding science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) research in a global context. Other conference features will include exhibitors from government, academia, and business who will showcase graduate programs, fellowships, summer undergraduate research programs, employment opportunities, and international research and education opportunities. Estimated annual conference participation is 1,000, including 650 students and 350 faculty and administrators from government, business, professional societies, and media organizations.",
