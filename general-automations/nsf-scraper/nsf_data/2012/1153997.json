 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides scholarships to able and financially needy students majoring in  physics, chemistry, environmental science, engineering, mathematics, and computer science.   The project is implementing five new, sustainable support programs and services, and  taking advantage of existing services to recruit, retain, and find jobs for more STEM majors. It is offering S-STEM scholarships of up to $6000 to each of two cohorts for their four years in college. A total of 25 students are benefiting from the scholarships, and many more students continue to benefit indefinitely from the added programs.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The academic programs into which the students go are strong, and there are academic support activities.  The programs are further transforming the college and its students. The project is studying the impact of these programs, and adjusting them to enhance what works and move away from what does not.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The project is increasing the number and diversity of students who complete a STEM major and go on to work in the field or to further education. This project not only impacts the 25 scholars, but benefits all current and future STEM majors. Results are being disseminated through a website dedicated to the program, reported at national conferences, and published in national journals. This study benefits other colleges with aspirations to create more STEM majors, and strengthens the country's STEM infrastructure.",
