The project motivates the study by working with real scenarios from the subject domains and by using real data sets provided by an advisory board.\r\n\r\nThis project increases the pool of graduates available for research and development in areas where large quantities of data must be analyzed. The PIs attract students from underrepresented groups, both as testers of the materials and as students in the initial course deployments. The resulting modules are freely available for adaptation and reuse.",
