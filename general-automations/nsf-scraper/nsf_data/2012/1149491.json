 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current theories of galaxy formation predict that the gas supply of galaxies is continuously replenished by the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium and the cosmic web.  For low-mass galaxies in low-density environments, most of this gas remains cool as it falls along filaments onto the galaxy disks.  Dr. Pisano will observe faint neutral hydrogen emission from these systems using single-dish radio telescopes and next-generation radio interferometers.  To date, such observations have revealed gas clouds around many galaxies, but the inferred accretion rates are too low to sustain star formation.  By mapping the diffuse gas around galaxies, this project will determine the gas accretion rate onto local galaxies and, using the demographics of gas around galaxies plus detailed observations of individual systems, will associated the hydrogen with either a tidal origin or cold accretion for the first time.  \r\n\r\nTo help address lagging student achievement in STEM subjects amongst middle school students, Dr. Pisano and collaborators will develop an open-ended, inquiry-based educational activity, \"What are those THINGS?\"  This activity will engage West Virginia middle school students in real astronomical research using archival multi-wavelength data on the THINGS galaxy sample followed by the opportunity to use the Skynet remotely-operable telescopes to acquire their own original optical, infrared, and radio data for their adopted galaxy.  Throughout this activity, trained undergraduate and graduate students will mentor the middle school students.  As such, this activity will provide inspiration and training to students of all levels to become the next generation of astronomers and educators.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:  This CAREER grant supported research on how galaxies obtain the gas needed to fuel the continued star formation.  We did this following a variety of approaches.\n\n \n\nUsing the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and the Parkes radio telescope Pisano and his PhD students, Nick Pingel (now at Australia National University) and Amy Sardone, have mapped the atomic neutral hydrogen (HI) in and around over 50 nearby galaxies in order to complete the census of the gaseous reservoir surrounding these galaxies.  As cold gas accretion is predicted to be correlated with lower mass galaxies in lower density environments, we can correlate the presence or absence of HI with the galaxy properties to infer ongoing accretion.  To date no such correlation has been found down to HI column densities a factor of 100 below the edge of galaxy disks (Pingel et al. 2018).  If future observations are to find large gaseous reservoirs, they will have to extend below this level.\n\n \n\nAlso using the GBT, Pisano, his graduate student Spencer Wolfe (WVU), and collaborators have conducted high resolution observations of extremely low column density HI around the Andromeda Galaxy in order to better determine its origin.  Our observations have shown that the apparently smooth filamentary structures connecting Andromeda with its neighbors are actually comprised of higher density clumps (Wolfe et al. 2013, 2016).  The implications are unclear, but suggest that the clouds are likely embedded in a more extensive circumgalactic medium.  Future observations with the new telescope in South Africa will help shed further light on the nature of gas around nearby galaxies. \n\n \n\nPisano also worked to enhance our ability to map such HI around galaxies using new radio cameras on the GBT.  Further, he has been looking at how the accretion process has evolved over the past four billion years with the Jansky Very Large Array in the COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey (CHILES).\n\n \n\nBroader Impact:  This grant supported the PhD of multiple graduate students.  Numerous public talks have been given by Pisano on this work in West Virginia, Virginia, and in South Africa on this work as well.  Finally, the grant supported the development of \"What are those THINGS?\", an open-ended, inquiry-based activity where middle school students get to collect their own data with radio telescopes to learn about the nature of galaxies in the nearby universe. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel J Pisano"
