 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because Earth is a complex coupled interacting system, where no one element is independent of any other, there are both pressing scientific and societal needs to improve our understanding how various physical, biological, and hydrological processes interact in surface Earth systems.  This requires the development of new and increasingly more sophisticated ways of mathematically describing these systems and improvements in software and user interfaces that will dramatically enhance our ability to simulate these systems to improve the accuracy and reliability of model predictions of weather, floods, droughts, and climate variability. Such improved models will allow researchers to make better use of available data across disciplines and improve theory and algorithms that are essential to understanding Earth system behavior. Unfortunately, at present there is significant overhead of time and effort needed for discovering, accessing, understanding, and preparing data required to populate these models, as well as long learning lead times on how to use presently available models, owing to their complexity.  This research overcomes some of these limitations by developing an innovative open modeling framework that can integrate data and models easily and is easy to use so that not only the research community and operational professionals can use it, but also policy makers and other interested parties. This EAGER award allows the construction of a prototype open meta-modeling framework that significantly reduces the time and effort on the part of users in the preparatory work for data and model comparisons, model testing and validations, for making fundamental knowledge discoveries in surface and ground water hydrological systems.  In this framework, components/modules interact via user-configured open interfaces that allow the addition and integration of hydrological models and data sources using a common meta-level architecture and scientific workflows. The proposed prototype is based on a recently completed modeling framework, HS-NWSRFS (Hydro-information System for improving the National Weather Service River Forecast System).  It represents a collaboration between investigators from three institutions, NASA, and NWS Ohio River Forecast Center (OHRFC). The funded effort will significantly expand the present code into an open community framework prototype.  Broader impacts of the work include interagency collaboration, improved hydrological forecasting for rivers, and support of a PI whose gender is under-represented in the sciences.",
