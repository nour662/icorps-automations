 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Summary:\r\nResearchers at the University of California at Davis, USA (UCD) and the Ufa State Aviation Technical University, Ufa, Russia (USATU) will investigate the influence of nanostructuring on the phase transformations and mechanical behavior in beta-Ti alloys.  A variety of materials synthesis and processing techniques including mechanical alloying by cryomilling, spark plasma sintering (SPS), equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) and high pressure torsion (HPT) will be implemented to synthesize nanostructured beta-Ti alloys.  Fundamental information generated will be used to establish the relationship between nanostructuring characteristics, thermal stability, phase transformations, and mechanical response in beta-Ti alloys.  Microstructure characterization studies using advanced diagnostic techniques (i.e., SEM, TEM), will provide an  understanding of the effect of the mechanical alloying, SPS and severe plastic deformation (ECAP/HPT) processing on nanostructural features, and furthermore understanding of fundamental phenomena (e.g., thermal stability, phase transformations and mechanical behavior) associated with nanostructuring in beta-Ti alloys.  Mechanical behavior will be studied to establish the relationship between nanostructural features and mechanical response (i.e., elastic modulus, strength, ductility) in nanostructured beta-Ti alloys.  Implementation of in-situ SEM and TEM mechanical characterization will provide direct observation of the dynamic deformation and microstructural changes in nanostructured beta-Ti alloys.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Summary:\r\nTi alloys are of scientific and technological interest, and in particular nanostructured beta-Ti alloys may exhibit a high strength with low elastic modulus, which are very attractive for biomedical applications, for example.  The collaborative research program will contribute towards the establishment of a fundamental understanding of the science of nanostructured beta-Ti alloys, as well as providing insight into the fundamental relationships that link alloy composition, microstructure and processing history of nanostructured alloys with mechanical behavior.  The novel approaches to be implemented, based on complementary expertise and resources between University of California at Davis, USA (UCD) and the Ufa State Aviation Technical University, Ufa, will generate comprehensive information that is currently lacking for understanding of the relationship between nanostructuring, phase transformation and mechanical behavior in beta-Ti alloys and beyond.  This, in turn, will ultimately impact the development of Ti materials with potential for applications in the biomedical, aerospace, and automotive industries.  The research activities will help nurture intellectual collaborations and academic exchanges through mutual visits, in particular with participation of students at the graduate and undergraduate levels between UCD and USATU.  This international collaboration will also enrich UCD's outreach program and will involve regional universities, colleges, and K-12.\r\n\r\nThe project is supported by the Metals and Metallic Nanostructures program and the Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research.",
