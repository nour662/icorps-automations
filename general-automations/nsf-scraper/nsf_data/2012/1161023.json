 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cycling of H2O between the mantle and the Earth's surface and between different reservoirs in the mantle are critical processes governing Earth's geodynamical and geochemical evolution, influencing everything from plate tectonics to habitability and climate. However, the distribution and inventory of H2O in the mantle remains uncertain, the mechanisms of transport between principal mantle reservoirs are not fully known, and the microscopic mechanisms by which H2O influences the properties of key Earth materials remain controversial. This project represents a multidisciplinary effort combining theoretical mineral physics, experimental petrology, and experimental rock physics to address some of the key outstanding questions regarding the distribution and behavior of H2O in the mantle.  \r\n\r\nThe current proposal will pursue several broad problems that arise from previous CSEDI funding to this group:\r\n1) To investigate the conditions required to incite hydrous melting in the asthenosphere or in the deep upper mantle above 410 km, we will conduct experimental, theoretical and spectroscopic studies to determine the mechanism and limits of H substitution in peridotite-saturated nominally anhydrous minerals, with a focus on garnet and pyroxene, and evaluate the conditions for hydrous melting of the asthenosphere and the upper mantle atop the 410 km discontinuity. \r\n2) To resolve seeming contradictions in our understanding of how H substitutes in olivine and how it influences key properties such as mantle creep strength, we will combine experiments, first-principle calculations and infrared spectroscopy to resolve critical uncertainties regarding the connection between structure, chemical environment, and minor element substitution on the mechanisms of incorporation of OH in olivine, garnets, and pyroxene and on the influence of H on diffusivity and creep strength.\r\n3) We will continue our efforts to use ERDA (Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis) to improve the accuracy of FTIR and SIMS determinations of H in nominally anhydrous minerals.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project includes continuation of a significant inter-departmental multidisciplinary effort integrating state-of-the-art materials theory with expertise in petrology and rock physics.  The effort includes involving three faculty, two post-doctoral researchers, and one graduate student and is facilitated by regular group meetings to ensure that our focus remains on multidisciplinary approaches and to promote interdisciplinary learning of all of the participants. For Hirschmann, Kohlstedt, and Withers, the proposed research dovetails well with the Earth sciences REU undergraduate intern site (Fluids in the Earth, from the Surface to the Core.  Wentzcovitch and Umemoto communicate results and methods to the broader scientific community through the Quantum ESPRESSO project and related workshops and tutorials and in the training of undergraduates through summer internships.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this collaborative project, we investigated the substitution of H in nominally anhydrous minerals from experimental, theoretical, and applied perspectives.  The chief outcomes of the study include a greatly improved understanding of the complexity of different configurations of OH substituting in olivine.  The different configurations are crucial owing to the contribution of entropy to the stabilization of OH on octahedral and tetrahedral sites.  High temperatures favor octahedral substitutions, consistent with experiments on transport and solubility, whereas low temperatures favor tetrahedral substitutions, consistent with room temperature IR investigations.  More generally, we used first principles techniques to investigate the relationship between O-H bond frequency and bond length, with consequences for both the influence of pressure on OH substitution and the volume isotope effect.   We also investigated theoretically the effect of aluminous/hydrous substitution on the well-known pressure shift observed in the post-stishovite phase transition. We uncovered the effect of hydrogen bonds across interstitial sites as the root cause of the large pressure shift. We also investigated experimentally diffusion of H into and out of olivine and established that diffusion of H into and out of olivine are governed by the same mechanisms and that the rates of diffusion of hydrogen ions associated with the various defects sites for hydrogen in olivine are all the same.  This result provides a very important tool for the interpretation of H diffusion profiles trapped in grains of rocks brought to Earth?s surface in volcanic eruptions in terms of the rate of ascent of these rocks. High-pressure experiments documented the effect of complex fluid and melt chemistry on the storage capacity of H in olivine and in particular, the effect of CO2-rich melts on dehydration.  This allows a more accurate estimation of the effect of CO2-rich melting in the deep upper mantle, the asthenosphere, and lithosphere on the hydration state of the residual solid mantle.  We also produced new nuclear (elastic recoil) analyses of H in a suite of nominally anhydrous minerals for improved microbeam (SIMS, FTIR) analyses.  Finally, we investigated the large-scale circulation of H and other volatiles between the Earth?s interior and exterior reservoirs\n\nThis research program involved the training of 2 doctoral graduate students, 2 postdoctoral researchers, and 1 research associate.  These young earth scientists are now employed in academic and industrial positions. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David L Kohlstedt"
