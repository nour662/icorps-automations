 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workload consolidation on virtualized datacenters is one common  \r\ntechnique used to manage the power usage and energy efficiency of  \r\ncloud platforms. However, current solutions limit the available  \r\ninsight into exactly how energy is consumed by the various cloud  \r\ntenants. \r\n\r\nIn order to address this gap, this research develops PowerMeter ? a  \r\nset of mechanisms and tools that make it possible to track energy  \r\nusage in virtualized cloud infrastructures, on granularity of  \r\nindividual VMs, or sets of VMs corresponding to a specific cloud  \r\ntenant, e.g., a customer or an application. PowerMeter is developed  \r\nfor a 3000-core fully instrumented datacenter prototype and a 1000- \r\ncore system based on newest-generation technology, and is evaluated  \r\nusing representative workload mixes based on popular cloud  \r\napplications and publicly available cloud traces. PowerMeter will  \r\nprovide currently missing capabilities for dynamically assessing in- \r\ndatacenter/in-cloud energy usage, necessary to enable energy usage  \r\ntransparency and accountability to cloud customers, to understand the  \r\nopportunities for improved energy efficiency in virtualized cloud  \r\nsystems, and for further development of management methods for energy- \r\nefficient datacenters.",
