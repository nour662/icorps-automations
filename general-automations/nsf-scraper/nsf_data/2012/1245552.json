  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall goal of this funding was to allow Dr. Nancy Denslow (PI) to attend the NSF CBET Grantee Conference in Baltimore, MD, June of 2012.  \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit:  Dr. Denslow was able to give an oral presentation at the conference on her research on the uptake of nanomaterials in fish and receive back criticisms and questions from the other attendees that have helped her build a better research program in nanomaterials.   She was also able to hear summaries of other research groups and from this she got additional cutting edge information that has helped her with her research program. \n\nDenslow, ND, Nanoparticle transport to oocytes and toxicologic consequences in fathead minnow, Platform presentation Annual NSF Grantees Meeting, Baltimore, Md, June 6-8, 2012, platform presentation.\n\nBroader Impacts:  The NSF CBET Grantee Conference provided an excellent opportunity for networking with other scientists and also allowed us to talk with Program Directors and better understand how NSF functions and also about all of the possible NSF/CBET programs that are available.  It was most interesting to get this information.  It was also an opportunity for Program Directors to interact with Dr. Denslow.   The discussions that came out of the conference have enabled new collaborations. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/25/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nancy D Denslow"
