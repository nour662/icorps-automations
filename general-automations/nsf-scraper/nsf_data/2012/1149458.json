 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies estimate that a majority of Internet traffic is digital content distribution, whose dominant component is applications that require tight time deadlines, such as content streaming and realtime services.  Excessive costs of always-available server-based content distribution networks (CDNs), and a lack of service guarantees in low-cost peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have led the pursuit of agile hybrids of both systems that seek to leverage the best of each.  \r\n \r\nSuch a hybrid requires coordination across peers, across information, and across shared resources available to the peers, which form the three research thrusts of this project.  The first objective of this project is the development of a systematic analytical framework to achieve this coordination, using ideas drawn from game theory, learning and stochastic networks.  The aim is to capture the fundamental properties of large-scale content distribution systems using analytical models, and bind together applications such as file sharing, streaming, cloud-based services, and device-to-device wireless networks by employing this framework.  The second is to generate prescriptions for ensuring economic viability by using revelations on the value of the system to participating agents.  Finally, the basic analytical methodology developed will be applicable generally beyond the core problem of content distribution.  The analytical insights will be validated via a smart-phone-based server-assisted P2P content streaming network. \r\n  \r\nBroader Impact:  The project is supported by an education and outreach agenda that aims at familiarizing students with analytical results developed and how best to apply them in a real-world setting.  A core component is a semester-long course for seniors and first-year grads in which classroom teaching is complemented by research experience through app development at the AM-Droiders smart-phone laboratory.   Outreach includes demonstrations and illustrative projects at a yearly week-long summer camp for high school students, as well as tele-seminars in which students from multiple universities (including Prairie View A&M, an HBCU) can participate interactively.  The project is further enhanced by strong collaborations with industry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA major portion of Internet traffic consists of video streaming and other content distribution.  Content providers seek to leverage the relatively inexpensive but unreliable P2P delivery methods along with more expensive but highly reliable content distribution networks to ensure fast and robust content delivery.   The objective of this project was to design coordination methods to span both approaches to content distribution systems, with the specific goals being (i) identification of popular content, (ii) efficient and distributed replication of such content, and (iii) swift extraction of this content on demand.\n\n \n\nThe research took a systematic approach under which, on the one hand we studied fundamentals of coordination using methods from game theory and designed multi-agent coordination algorithms to instantiate these methods.  On the other hand, we implemented and tested several of these algorithms by simulations and experiments on an Android smart phone testbed.  The major results included determining the impact of selfish decision making on system efficiency, how to mitigate inefficiencies via incentives for better coordination, optimal selection of cache contents for ensuring high throughput content delivery with delay constraints, optimal chunk selection policies to ensure high availability of content chunks, as well as interface management between long range and short range wireless interfaces to ensure reliable content streaming. \n\n \n\nThe research and technological impact of this project was to bring together a rich set of analytical tools drawn from stochastic processes, optimization and game theory to merge them with real-world issues of deadline constrained content delivery over unreliable wireless links, and ensuring a high quality of user experience with a low probability of video re-buffering, as well as practical implementation problems over existing hardware and software platforms.\n\n \n\nThe project also informed and educated both students and the broader society with curriculum development on courses on computer networking and outreach to high school students via summer camps.  Several female and minority students were involved in all aspects of the project ranging from working on course projects to graduate theses.  Thus, the project also played a role in the integration of under-represented groups to the scientific community.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Srinivas Shakkottai"
