 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to investigate how the lower atmosphere affects the ionosphere through dynamical and electrodynamical processes during stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) events, when profound changes have been observed from the lower to upper atmosphere.  The project involves using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere- Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIME-GCM) and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension (WACCM-X) to address a number of questions: What causes changes to atmospheric solar and lunar tides during a SSW?  Are there significant changes of traveling planetary waves during a SSW?  What is the impact of rapid wind change during a SSW on gravity wave generation?  How does the ionosphere respond to the changes of tides, planetary waves, and gravity waves?  How do these effects depend on solar activity?  The result of  this study will be a better understanding of the cross-region and cross-scale coupling of the lower and upper atmosphere responsible for the SSW effects.",

Additional objectives are to further develop the NCAR Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension (WACCM-X), by implementing an ionospheric module, coupling WACCM with a plasmasphere model, and increasing the model resolution to resolve mesoscale processes. These objectives have been achieved during the performance period of this project (2012-2017). Here is a summary of the major outcomes that address these objectives, and the scientific questions posed under the objectives.</p>\n<p>Our studies have established the connection between the ionospheric/thermospheric short-term variability with the variability from the lower atmosphere. In particular, variability of both solar thermal tides and lunar gravitational tides due to mean wind change and interaction with planetary waves, as exemplified during SSW, has been demonstrated to affect the ionosphere and thermosphere through (i) modulating ionospheric dynamo process, and (ii) changing the plasma and neutral compositional structure by affecting the transport in the lower thermosphere. Apart from short-term tidal variability associated with SSW and interaction with planetary waves, whole atmosphere simulations using WACCM-X reveal strong, seemingly stochastic, day-to-day variability of tides, which in turn leads to strong ionospheric day-to-day variability, through the two mechanisms mentioned above, even during geomagnetically quiet periods. The day-to-day variability of ExB drift, ionospheric electron density, and Sq current simulated or deduced from the WACCM-X and TIME-GCM simulations compare well with observations (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>Our studies have explored the predictability of the upper atmosphere. By performing inter-comparisons of multiple whole atmosphere models, all with nearly identical troposphere and stratosphere, we determined that the major cause of model bias and loss of forecast skills is the uncertainty associated with parameterization of gravity wave sources and impacts (Figure 2). The studies underline the need for and motivate the development of whole atmosphere data assimilation.</p>\n<p>A whole atmosphere data assimilation system has been developed using WACCM/WACCM-X and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) method. Apart from assimilating conventional meteorological observations, the WACCM/WACCM-X+DART system also assimilates middle and upper atmosphere observations, including temperature observations by NASA TIMED/SABER and AURA/MLS. Data assimilation significantly reduces temperature bias in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, improves the simulation of elevated stratopause and NOx downward transport, and variability of the ionosphere following SSW.</p>\n<p>Since gravity wave parameterization schemes are severely limited in representing the dynamics in the whole atmosphere context, we have developed a mesoscale-resolving version of WACCM to account for the broad range of scales and the variability associated with gravity waves. The gravity wave energy density, momentum flux, and their spatial and seasonal variation compare well with those derived from observations. The model results vividly demonstrate the increasing dominance of gravity waves in the upper atmosphere (Figure 3). We have deduced the total gravity wave energy flux from the model results, and found that at the lower thermosphere the gravity wave contribution to energetics is comparable to the daily average Joule power input to the upper atmosphere (Figure 4). With the increasing resolution, the model captures the peak wind shear structures near the tropopause and mesopause. The magnitudes and the statistics of these large wind shears compare well with observations, and we have started to explore their implications for transport and mixing in the regions. During SSW, high-resolution simulations show that gravity wave sources associated with tropical convection, polar jets, and orography can change, which were not characterized in previous studies using parameterization.</p>\n<p>We have completed the development of an interactive ionospheric module in WACCM-X that includes electric wind dynamo, F-region O+ transport, and electron and ionosphere temperature solver (thus heating of neutral atmosphere by thermal electrons and collisions with ions). We have started the validation of the WACCM-X by comparing model results with thermosphere and ionosphere observations. We will soon release the model to the broad research community as part of NCAR CESM2, and we have already had a user group workshop at the recent NSF/CEDAR Workshop.</p>\n<p>We have also developed a coupling structure that can couple WACCM-X with a plasmasphere model, and development is currently underway by collaborators at NRL to couple WACCM-X with the NRL SAMI3 model.</p>\n<p>These scientific findings and technical achievements have been reported in more than 30 peer-reviewed publications, including a recent review paper in Space Weather Journal. Graduates and postdoctoral fellows are among the lead authors or co-authors of these papers. Three publications were featured in EOS Research Spotlights.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/08/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Han-Li&nbsp;Liu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1138784/1138784_10174866_1499520382811_waccmGW--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1138784/1138784_10174866_1499520382811_waccmGW--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1138784/1138784_10174866_1499520382811_waccmGW--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Gravity waves from the troposphere to the lower thermosphere are directly simulated by the high-resolution WACCM.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Liu et al.
