The workshop will explore recent advances in symplectic geometry, contact geometry, sub-Riemannian geometry, as well as  hyperbolic geometry, with a special emphasis on the interplay between all these aspects of geometry and  applications to control theory. More information about the program can be found at the website: http://cimpadakar2012.ucad.sn/\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the meeting is to bring together experts and young researchers working in geometry and control theory. The workshop introduces graduate students and young researchers to current research topics in geometry and control theory. In addition, it provides an opportunity for international collaboration between researchers and encourage cross fertilization between different relevant topics.",
