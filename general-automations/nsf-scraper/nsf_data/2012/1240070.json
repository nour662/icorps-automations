 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fordham University's Noyce Mathematics Scholarship Program is preparing 18 STEM majors and STEM professionals to teach middle and high school mathematics in high-need New York City public schools.  Students in this program earn a Master of Science in Teaching while carrying out training in a core activity, the Japanese Lesson Study.  This intensive and structured approach to planning lessons involves collaborative planning, presentation of the lesson to actual classes of students while being observed, and revision of the lesson as a result of the critique of the observers? and the teachers' own perceptions of the lesson's strengths and weaknesses.  By learning to reflect on their own practice, to be open to observation and feedback from their peers and to encourage their colleagues, new teachers are better prepared to engage continuously in efforts to improve their practice, not only on the \"planned\" lessons, but on all their interactions with their students. Noyce Scholars continue to interact with the program during their challenging first two years of teaching, helping them to remain in the classroom despite structural and systemic conditions that drive many teachers away from the profession. Overall, this program can become a model for teacher preparation while serving the broader need of providing qualified teachers with high mastery of their content to the high-need classrooms of the city of New York.",

This project funded a total of 14 graduate STEM scholarships to post-baccalaureate career changers to become long-term mathematics teachers in high-needs middle or high schools in New York City. The recipients of the funding were trained through rigorous coursework and field-based teaching experiences.  Participants received field support through a continuous and successful partnership between Fordham Graduate School of Education, Fordham Mathematics Department, and New York City public schools, including schools within the Fordham Partnership Support Organization.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit. To date, the program objectives were met by 14 recipients of the NSF funding, who completed their Master of Science in Teaching (MST) degree at Fordham University Graduate School of Education and committed to teach at least 2 years in a high- needs district.  Participants were trained in both mathematics and pedagogy by competing coursework and by participating in a carefully designed lesson study, which allowed them to critically access and discuss with peers and mentors content and pedagogical ideas implemented in the observed classrooms.  Upon graduation, the participants continued to receive support from Fordham and the grant by way of mentoring, cohort-based support, and other resources.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact. The Fordham University/Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship was used by Fordham University Graduate School of Education to help recruit and prepare quality STEM students for a career in teaching mathematics.  The grant provided the opportunity for high-needs school districts to hire and retain quality mathematics teachers who had support through the resources provided by the grant and who remained on the job.\n\nBelow we state 6 major goals that underlie Fordham University\u2019s Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, along with their outcomes.\n\n1.   Provide funding and programmatic supports to mathematics majors who will pursue teaching mathematics in high-needs school districts.\n\nOutcome: Funding and programmatic supports were provided to 14 Noyce scholarship recipients 13 of whom were mathematics majors, and who have since graduated from the program. Of the 13, 11 are working in high-needs schools, 1 works as a full-time tutor and 1 is still seeking employment. \n\n2.   Provide funding and programmatic supports to STEM professionals as they prepare to become secondary mathematics teachers in high-needs school districts.\n\nOutcome: One student came from a STEM field prior to entering the Fordham University Math NOYCE program.  This student has graduated and is currently teaching in a high-needs district. \n\n3.   Build habits of collaboration and support in teaching through multiple experiences with Lesson Study and mentoring.\n\nOutcome: All graduates of the program participated in summer programs, received mentoring and have participated in various lesson study experiences. In our final summer retreat and end-of-grant event we invited all former scholars to come together and reflect on their experiences.  Results from a student survey indicated cohorts have remained close and still interact with one another both professionally and personally. This retreat and end-of-grant event provided evidence not only that the grant was successful in building habits of collaboration and support but also opened another venue for different cohorts to interact and collaborate.\n\n4.   Provide STEM majors with mathematics courses designed to focus on mathematics content and the teaching and learning of that content.\n\nOutcome: Noyce scholars were taught two mathematics courses, one in Probability and one in Geometry, that expanded and strengthened their content knowledge and understanding of how to transfer this knowledge to their students. These courses were taught by professors from the Mathematics Department at Fordham, and developed in collaboration with the GSE math education faculty.  The aim of the coursework was to provide deeper understanding and knowledge of mathematical topics and concepts from the middle school/high school curriculum and build confidence in teaching them.\n\n5.   Respond to the critical need for secondary mathematics teachers in high-needs school districts.\n\nOutcome: All recipients of the Noyce Grant at Fordham University were required to sign a formal, legal commitment obligating them to teach in a high-needs school district in exchange for financial support for tuition, summer training, and other professional development requirements.  An overwhelming majority of NOYCE recipients are currently working within such high-needs districts, four already having satisfied their minimum time commitment requirement. This goal has been met successfully.\n\n6.   Address retention among teachers by providing support mechanisms during the first 2 years of teaching.\n\nOutcome: Almost all Noyce Scholarship recipients have maintained their teaching positions in high-needs schools. In addition, a survey conducted by a third party found that a majority of recipients reported feeling effective in their roles as teachers and maintained an overall positive view of the teaching profession.  \n\nWith proper support and mentoring provided by the Noyce grant, recipients seemed to be better able to transition into the teaching profession and maintain their enthusiasm for the career.  This is also evidenced by the commitment of four of the scholars who have continued in the teaching profession beyond the minimum teaching requirement.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/25/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip Dituri"
