 "awd_abstract_narration": "The position of the Arctic treeline is an important regulator of surface energy budgets, carbon cycling, habitat availability and subsistence resources in high latitude environments. Changes in the health and spatial extent of the arctic forest are largely governed by relationships among climate and the physiology, growth and reproductive success of the trees. Previous work along a longitudinal gradient in the Brooks Range, Alaska, showed a pattern of declining growth in response to rising temperatures from west to east. This study aims to uncover the processes underlying this trend and examine the implications for reproductive success and the establishment of new trees beyond the current treeline. Its goals are to measure and compare tree microclimates of the western, central and eastern Brooks Range; compare and contrast continuous measurements of white spruce canopy gas exchange over several growing seasons in the western, central and eastern Brooks Range in order to evaluate the relative importance of drought stress and cold soils at the arctic treeline in Alaska; make detailed measurements of the seasonality and magnitude of growth in all major organs of white spruce in the western, central and eastern Brooks Range, assess the potential for shifts in allocation and to more accurately evaluate current and future tree performance; and conduct a detailed study of longitudinal variation in seed production, seed quality, seedling establishment and seedling performance (physiology and growth) within the Brooks Range, as these demographic processes will largely determine whether a treeline will advance, remain static or retreat in response to climate change. Results of the study will inform policy makers and local residents of the likely outcomes of interactions between climate change and the health and spatial extent of the highly sensitive arctic forests of Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe team will reach out to students and adults in rural and urban Alaska through four specific activities. They will extend an existing relationship with biology teachers at Kotzebue High School and visit their classrooms to introduce the importance of vegetation as a mediator of climate change and to share the results of previous and ongoing work in the area. They will provide opportunities for outstanding students from Kotzebue High School to join their research team in the field at the Kugururok site. They will arrange to be interviewed by Kotzebue Public Radio to inform the communities about their research activities and findings, and they will participate in a BLM Campbell Creek Science Center Fireside Chat series.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overarching goal of this project was to improve our understanding of controls on growth and reproduction of white spruce growing near their northern limits in the Brooks Range of Alaska.  This is an important topic, because changes in the distribution of forest versus tundra have implications for carbon cycling, land surface energy budgets, wildlife habitat and the availability of subsistence resources to local communities.  Previous studies found that trees in the western Brooks Range generally increased growth during late 20th century climate warming, while those in the eastern Brooks Range showed no evidence of a change in growth.  This failure to increase growth in response to warming is known as \"divergence\" and it has been found at numerous sites throughout the Boreal Biome.  Climate records for the Brooks Range are few and far between, yet models suggest the eastern Brooks Range may be drier than the west.  On this basis, researchers have suggested the failure of white spruce in the eastern Brooks Range to increase growth in response to warming may reflect moisture limitation.  We tested the hypothesis that low and steady growth of trees in the eastern Brooks Range is a result of moisture limitation.  We approached this hypothesis using a combination of retrospective measurements (carbon isotopes in tree-ring cellulose) and detailed tree physiological observations (point measurements of needle gas exchange, continuous measurements of canopy transpiration, etc.) over four years that varied widely in terms of climate.  Our results showed no evidence that growth of white spruce in the eastern Brooks Range is limited by moisture availability, despite our observation that precipitation is generally lower and evaporative demand is generally greater in the east than in the west.  Instead, we found that soil nutrient availability and foliar nutrient concentrations were lower in the eastern than in the western Brooks Range.  Across all sixteen of our study sites, we were able to explain 75% of the variation in white spruce branch extension growth using foliar nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations as predictors.  To further test the hypothesis that low and \"divergent\" growth in the eastern Brooks Range may reflect nutrient limitation, we carried out a fertilization experiment.  Addition of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium led to a stronger growth response at our study sites in the east than at those in the central and western Brooks Range, confirming that white spruce growth in the east is more strongly nutrient limited than in the west.  We hypothesize that greater nutrient limitation in the east is a result of colder winter air temperature, colder growing season soils and more limited microbial processing of organic matter than in the western Brooks Range.  While moisture limitation may well be the cause of divergence at many sites in the Boreal Biome, our results highlight the importance of considering low nutrient availability as another potential reason why trees may not increase growth in a warming climate.  \n\nOur project supported two graduate students.  It also provided field research opportunities for four recent college graduates, one Native Alaskan High School student and one postdoctoral fellow.  Our research activities and results have been disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, presentations to the public at the National Park Service in Kotzebue, Alaska, presentations to high school students and teachers at Kotzebue High School, radio interviews in Kotzebue and presentations to the scientific community at annual meetings of the Ecological Society of America and the American Geophysical Union.  Additionally, we provided the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority with estimates of forest productivity and solar radiation data from our climate station in the western Brooks Range to facilitate their evaluation of potential alternative energy resources for the remote Native Village of Noatak, Alaska, which is currently dependent upon costly fuel deliveries.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick F Sullivan"
