 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research activities supported by this award are in the field of geometric analysis, and the specific problems posed are at the intersection of three fields: partial differential equations, differential geometry, and mathematical physics.   For example, the functional determinant of an elliptic operator is a problem originating in spectral theory and mathematical physics, and the analysis of the particular problem  considered is a variational problem leading to a fourth order elliptic equation.  The associated Lagrangian is unbounded, and the existence of solutions and their qualitative properties is highly nontrivial.  Similar equations are used to model the properties of thin films.  Another problem proposed is the construction of Bach-flat metrics on four-manifolds using surgery methods.  The Bach tensor arises in general relativity and conformal geometry, and the Bach-flat condition is the Euler-Lagrange equation for a functional on the space of Riemannian metrics which is quadratic in the curvature, and can be viewed as a nonlinear system of partial differential equations with certain invariance properties.  The final set of problems we propose involves nonlinear equations arising in conformal geometry and the theory of optimal transportation.   We are specifically interested in the construction of singular solutions of these equations as a way to study the existence of complete Riemannian metrics with prescribed curvature conditions. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe interaction of geometry and analysis dates back to at least the eighteenth century, and yet continues to be an important and highly active field of mathematical research. The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire to understand certain properties of the physical world, and differential geometry was developed to understand the geometry of curved spaces - for example, the curvature of the surface of the earth, or the curvature of space by matter as predicted by general relativity. In the same way that Descartes realized that plane geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential geometry can be studied using techniques from analysis, especially differential equations. The research in this proposal involves disparate problems from geometry and mathematical physics but are united by the role played by mathematical analysis in their study.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThis award supported research in mathematical problems in the areas of partial differential equations and geometry.  Each of the problems addressed ultimately has some connection, either direct or by inspiration,, to questions in physics.\n\n \n\nThe first problem involves the construction of new solutions of spaces satisfying a certain geometric condition called \"Bach-flatness\".  This name comes from a paper in the physics literature of the 1920s by the physicist R. Bach, who was studying a certain physical model related to Einstein's theory of General Relativity.  At the (mathematical) center of Einstein's theory are the so-called Field Equations, a system of equations connecting the geometry and physics of space-time.  Bach's model resulted in a different, and in some ways more complicated system of equations, and his model remains of interest in theoretical physics.\n\n \n\nIn joint work with J. Viaclovsky we attempted to produce new examples of spaces (in precise mathematical terms, Riemmanian manifolds) satisfying the Bach-flat condition.  As a preliminary step, we needed to study known examples to gain a deeper understanding of their 'stablity' -- that is, whether these known examples can be perturbed to give new examples, or whether these examples were in some sense isolated.  This turns out to be a crucial question in our technique for producing new solutions out of existing ones, by 'gluing' them together.  \n\n \n\nOver the course of two major papers supported by this award, Viaclovsky and I studied the stability of solutions and the problem of gluing together new solutions.  Although we were not quite successful on the latter problem, we were able to adapt our technique to produce solutions of a related system of equations which are known as 'critical metrics' in four dimensions. \n\n \n\nIn other work supported by this problem, I studied a problem from theoretical physics in which one studies the spectral properties of a Riemannian manifold.  Althought the technicalities are involved, the basic problem is once again to solve a very complex equation which tells us something about a physical system.  A little more precisely, Andrea Malchiodi and I studied the regularized determinant of certain conformally invariant operators, and proved a fundamental multiplicity result which shows that the set of all solutions (in contrast to related problems studied in string theory) should be much more difficult to understand. \n\n \n\nFinally, this award helped to support the graduate work and thesis projects of two PhD students: Yueh-Ju Lin, currently a postdoctoral scholar the University of Michigan, and Gang Li, who holds a tenure-track position at Shandong University (China).\n\n \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nIn The intellectual merit of this proposal\nderives in part from the importance of the problems\ndescribed to both the general theory of nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations and to the geometric applications which\ninspire the investigations.  The problems and the approaches to\ntheir resolution offer the promise of advancing the basic knowledge\nof the theory and developing new techniques that\nmay be applicable to other areas of mathematics.\n\n Broader Impacts\n\n\nThe research activity in this proposal will have broader impacts on\ntwo levels.\n\nThe first level of impact is the expected contributions to the basic\ntheory of partial differential equations and differential geometry.\nThe problems proposed are representative of many which arise in both\npure and applied mathematics and the physical sciences (e.g,\ntheoretical physics).\n\nSecond, the success of the research depended in part on the\ntraining of the graduate students under the PI's supervision. Moreover,they provided the students with a broad range of tools and basic knowledge that will serve them well in other mathematical and educational pursuits.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/16/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew J Gursky"
