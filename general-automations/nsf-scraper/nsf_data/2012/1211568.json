This work focuses on cool giant planets, which are the type expected to be first detected with these techniques (due to their larger orbital distances from the host star).  They will use data collected from direct imaging surveys to test models of the atmospheres, and include clouds, vertical mixing, non-solar abundances, and non-local chemical equilibrium effects in their calculations. \r\n\r\nThis project will also involve public outreach through Lowell Observatory and the American Museum of Natural History, which will develop and present online and in-person programs on the scientific results from direct imaging of planets.  They will also train undergraduate and graduate students in research.",
