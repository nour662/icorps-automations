In particular to prove the refined Gross-Prasad conjecture for unitary groups in three variables using the relative trace formulae of Jacquet-Rallis secondly to prove a Gross-Zagier type formula for unitary Shimura varieties using the approach of the arithmetic relative trace formulae initiated by W.Zhang recently,and thirdly to study their applications to the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture and Bloch-Kato conjecture on the relation between Chow groups, Selmer groups and L-values.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will provide support for a recent PhD, now a PostDoc at Harvard to pursue research in Number Theory and Representation Theory. This research concerns a special type of function known as an L-function which encodes information about geometry and arithmetic.",
