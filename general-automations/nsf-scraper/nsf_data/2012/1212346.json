 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project suppoerted by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Shih-Yuan Liu of the University of Oregon will develop polypyridine ligands in which a pyridine unit in 2-2'-bipyridine (bipy) is replaced by an isosteric 1,2-dihydro-1,2-azaborine heterocycle. This replacement results in low-symmetry polypyridyls ligands (BNbipy) that generate upon coordination with transition metals complexes that are isostructural to the corresponding metal bipyridine complexes. This isosteric replacement approach expands the diversity of accessible bipy ligands for coordination chemistry. The project encompasses synthesis of new boron-nitrogen heterocycles, coordination chemistry of BNbipy ligands, and physical methods for characterization of the new ligands and their transition metal complexes. Basic science in boron chemistry, coordination chemistry, and photophysical characterization of these new polypyridyl ligands and their corresponding metal complexes will be unraveled during these investigations.\r\n\r\n2-2'-Bipyridine (bipy) is among the most important and widely used ligands in coordination chemistry. The proposed research seeks to utilize the BN/CC isosterism approach to expand the chemical space of bipy ligands. Successful accomplishment of this project will positively impact the fields of coordination chemistry, dye-sensitized solar cells, organic light-emitting diode materials development, and biomedical research that utilize bipy derivatives. The project will also provide comprehensive and diverse training to the graduate students and undergraduate students involved, including internship opportunities at national laboratories and private industry.",
