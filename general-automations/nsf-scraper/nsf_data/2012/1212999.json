They thus have an impact on diverse disciplines, such as &nbsp;basic &nbsp;sciences (oceanography, marine biology, geology),&nbsp; industry (off-shore oil, aquaculture), environment monitoring (climate recording, pollution control, prediction of natural disturbances)&nbsp;&nbsp;and security (surveillance for defense applications, homeland/port security, ocean accident remediation). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ocean is a harsh environment in which to operate, and the technology that goes into autonomous &nbsp;underwater systems is a sophisticated one.

From bottom to top, we addressed&nbsp; (1) signal processing for establishing improved-quality acoustic communication links, (2) packaging of information and adjustment of transmission power to increase the chances of successful packet reception in a network, and (3) top-level system architecture where multiple sensors access the fusion center in a random fashion to send data packets that are then used to reconstruct field events. A specific field event that was of interest to our work was one where multiple moving objects traverse the area populated by sensors while emitting signature signals. The signals are picked by the sensors, encoded into digital data packets, &nbsp;and transmitted to the fusion center. Reconstruction of the objects&rsquo; trajectories is then attempted using a custom-designed method that is capable of operating with limited information (the information is limited because only so many data packets can be transmitted over the limited acoustic bandwidth, and not all of them will be received successfully because of the channel distortions).</p>\n<p>Key outcomes of our work included a number of new design approaches within each of the three areas mentioned.

This method incorporates &nbsp;packet coding and adaptive adjustment of transmission power, which is made&nbsp; in response to the information fed back from the receiver. Packet coding is a simple, stand-alone technique that&nbsp; does not replace conventional bit coding, but instead operates together with it to improve the link reliability.&nbsp; Packet coding &nbsp;can also be applied together with any type of signal processing, i.e. it is readily applicable to any existing acoustic modem. Its major advantage is in increasing the chances of successful data packet delivery, which it does&nbsp; by coding ahead. This is an important asset in networks where full reliability is required through acknowledged receipts &ndash; there, increasing the chances of success results in fewer re-transmissions, which in turn yields a shorter delivery time on acoustic links where round-trip delays are long (sound travels a hundred thousand times slower than radio signals).</p>\n<p>Finally, on the third level (3) we have assessed the intricate interplay between the number of sensors, transmission rate and the available bandwidth needed to achieve a certain quality of reconstruction. Using computer simulation, we have demonstrated &nbsp;successful operation of our method.
