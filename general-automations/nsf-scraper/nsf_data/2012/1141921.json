 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator (PI) will investigate the magnetodynamics of the solar surface and upper convection zone in both quiet and active regions of the Sun, in order to determine the origin of the 'quiet Sun' magnetic field. He will evaluate the relative contributions of shallow surface dynamo action and deep convection zone dynamo action, as well as establish the rate of magnetic flux emerging from these two processes, by comparing observations with calculations from dynamo and magnetoconvection simulations within a supergranule-scale portion of the solar surface. His simulations will include the distribution of vertical and horizontal magnetic field strengths, the spectrum of vertical and horizontal magnetic fields, and the variation of supergranule sizes with the solar cycle. The PI's simulations solve the non-linear, compressible, three-dimensional equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and internal energy, as well as the induction equation for the magnetic field. The PI's model uses a tabular equation-of-state to determine the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium pressure, temperature, opacities, and source functions, as a function of log density and internal energy. \r\n\r\nThe PI is motivated by the fact that the behavior of magnetic fields near the solar surface is the ultimate driver of Earth's space weather. The simulation results will be posted on multiple web sites where they will be widely available to the solar scientific community and to the general public. The PI will mentor a female collaborator at Michigan State University in the use and analysis of his simulations and observations. The simulation results from this effort will also be used to enhance a museum exhibit demonstrating how scientists use sophisticated models, now being constructed at the Lansing, Michigan \"Impression 5 Science Center,\" which hosts over 100,000 people annually, both individually and in school groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nExplosions in the atmosphere of the Sun send high energy particles (electrons and protons) along with magnetic fields streaming toward the Earth.  When these magnetic fields and energetic particles impact Earth\u00c6s atmosphere they can have a significant adverse impact on our life.  The process that leads to these explosions starts with the generation of magnetic fields by dynamo action in the solar convection zone (the outer third of the Sun).  The goal of this project was to study how the dynamo generates magnetic fields in the presence of a large density stratification (change in density with height).\n\nDynamo action in the convection zone generates magnetic fields.  Where the field is strong, loops can rise up toward the surface.  In our calculations we approximated the tops of these loops (Fig 1.) as flat, uniform, horizontal field entering the bottom of the computational domain and investigated how dynamo action enhanced and modified these fields.\n\nUp flows and down flows of magneto-convection in the upper convection zone (top 10% geometrically, but top 2/3 of the density stratification) stretch and twist the magnetic field which strengthens it.  The up flows bring the field toward the surface, while the down flows push it down.  This bends the horizontal field into serpentine loops (Fig. 2.).  The vigorous, small-scale convective motions near the surface shred the large loops into bundles of fine filamentary loops.   When these emerge through the surface they appear as mixed polarity field.  The opposite polarity fields counter stream into unipolar concentrations as the legs of the larger, coherent loop emerge through the surface.  The strong field in these legs inhibits the convective motions, which reduces the transport of heat to the surface leading to the formation of dark sunspsots.\n\nThe average magnetic field strength decreases as the surface is approached.  The surface field exhibits the same large scale pattern as the field at 10 Mm depth, which represents the convective up flow / down flow pattern at large depths (Figs. 3 &amp; 4).  This pattern is observed as the magnetic network on the Sun.\n\nThe process of magnetic field generation and emergence as modeled here is one step in the chain of events leading from the global solar dynamo, to explosions in the solar atmosphere, to the impact of high energy protons and electrons on the atmosphere of the Earth.  These high energy particles can damage satellite electronics, hurt astronauts, increase the ionization of Earth\u00c6s upper atmosphere and interfere with radio communication and GPS operation, and induce currents in the electric grid which can trip circuit breakers and black out extensive areas.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/09/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert F Stein"
