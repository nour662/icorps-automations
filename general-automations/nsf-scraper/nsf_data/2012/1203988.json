  "por_txt_cntn": "\nKnot theory is the study of knotted loops in 3-dimensional space, considered up to smooth deformations that do not break the loops.  Over the course of this project, the PI studied bridge surfaces, where a bridge surface for a knot is an embedded plane that cuts the knot into two collections of unknotted arcs.  Topologists often understand complicated spaces by cutting them into these types of simple building blocks.  The bridge number of a particular knot is the minimal complexity of such a decomposition, and this knot invariant yields a useful partition of the set of all knots into different classes.  For instance, the collection of 2-bridge knots provides a test case for many theorems -- these knots are parameterized by the rational numbers and the additional structure given by their bridge surfaces makes proving difficult propositions tractable for 2-bridge knots.  The PI studied a generalization of bridge number to many different decomposing surfaces, giving rise to a sequence of integers called the bridge spectrum.  Fundamental problems around this structure include computing bridge spectra for large classes of knots and determining which sequences of integers can appear as bridge spectra of knots in 3-dimensional space.  By connecting bridge surface to another class of surfaces called Heegaard surfaces, the PI achieved considerable progress on both fronts, completely determining the bridge spectra of most iterated torus knots, which exhibit previously unknown behavior.\n\n \n\nThe PI also made new connections between Heegaard surfaces, bridge surfaces, and other structures in low-dimensional topology.  An n-manifold is an abstract topological space that locally resembles n-dimensional real space, and a Heegaard surface splits a 3-manifold into two simple pieces.  Recently, David Gay and Robion Kirby developed a decomposition called a trisection of a 4-manifold, a splitting into not two, but three simple pieces, as a 4-dimensional analog of a Heegaard splitting.  In collaboration with Jeffrey Meier, the PI produced several important results in the nascent field of trisections.
