 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit. This project concerns mechanisms by which plant hosts recognize viral pathogens and initiate specific defenses. The research is focused on a family of DNA-containing plant viruses known as geminiviruses.  In plants, RNA silencing is an important antiviral defense that results in specific degradation of viral mRNA. In the case of DNA viruses, a related process (RNA-directed methylation) leads to the methylation of viral DNA and associated histone proteins that together constitute the viral chromosome. Methylation typically leads to gene silencing, and recent work from this laboratory has demonstrated that cellular pathways used to methylate endogenous cellular genes and viral DNA are essentially identical. In this project, geminiviruses will be employed as models to further study the RNA-directed methylation pathway. Specifically, the roles of cellular RNA polymerases II, IV, and V in de novo methylation of viral genomes will be examined using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches.  The DNA sequence features that recruit these enzymes to the viral chromosome, the methylation status of the sequences that they recognize, and the nature of the non-coding RNAs that they generate will be investigated.  In addition, the geminivirus system will be used to identify and characterize cellular proteins that recognize methylation marks on chromatin and translate these into changes in gene expression. Methylation controls cellular gene expression during normal development, and is important for organizing inactive regions of cellular chromosomes and silencing potentially damaging invasive DNAs. Thus studying geminivirus chromatin methylation promises to increase our understanding of viral pathogenesis and of fundamental processes that govern the activity of cellular chromatin.\r\nBroader Impacts. A better understanding of host antiviral defenses will eventually lead to the development of plants that are better able to withstand or resist virus attack. This project will integrate research and education by contributing to the training of visiting scientists, postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students, some of whom are underrepresented minorities. In addition, the PI participates in the NSF REU Program sponsored by the Department of Molecular Genetics at Ohio State University, and in the OSU Summer Practical Workshop in Plant Functional Genomics, which attracts international and domestic students, postdocs, young faculty, and high school teachers and trains them in basic techniques and principles of molecular biology and genomics. The PI has also contributed materially by donating antibodies to a new, soon-to-be-launched Plant Antibody Facility. As Director of the campus-wide interdisciplinary graduate program in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB, currently ~130 PhD students) for the past 16 years, the PI has a long history of promoting graduate education. Efforts include an active role in recruiting minority students through the Graduate School's SROP Program and the University Office of Diversity and Inclusion. The PI also has an active interest in enabling interactions between faculty and students and annually co-organizes the MCDB Seminar Series, the Interdisciplinary Graduate Program Symposium, and the First-Year Graduate Student Seminar, which includes training in research ethics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA long term goal of research in this laboratory is to understand the molecular mechanisms used by plants to defend against the DNA-containing geminiviruses, and how geminiviruses counter these defenses.  This project focused on repressive viral chromatin methylation (methylation of cytosine residues in DNA, and dimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9, H3K9me2) as an epigenetic antiviral defense.  Repressive methylation maintains cellular genome integrity by silencing endogenous invasive DNAs such as transposons, jumping genes that if active can cause gene and chromosome mutations.  Thus, studying geminivirus chromatin methylation increases our understanding of both viral pathogenesis and of a fundamental epigenetic process that governs the organization and activity of cellular chromatin. \n\nIn the course of our studies, we have expanded knowledge RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and H3K9 methylation mechanisms in the following ways:\n\nWe found that RNA polymerases IV and V (Pol IV and Pol V), plant-specific enzymes specialized for RdDM, are not required to initiate viral DNA methylation, but are necessary for its amplification, which allows host plants to \"recover\" from infection.\n\nRemarkably, however, we showed that Pol IV and Pol V are required to establish H3K9me2 on viral chromatin. Fully functional Pol II (which also transcribes viral and host mRNAs) is also needed to establish H3K9me2 on viral chromatin, and appears to recruit Pol IV.\n\nIn addition, we have characterized non-coding primary transcripts (RNAs) generated by Pol IV and Pol V from a geminivirus genome.  Most transcripts range in size from ~150 to ~200 nucleotides and have unprocessed 5' and 3' ends. \n\nWe used the geminivirus system to place a new protein, double-stranded RNA binding protein 3 (DRB3) in the RdDM pathway.\n\nWe characterized EML1 and EML3 as histone reader proteins that bind methylated H3K36, another epigenetic mark typically found on active chromatin.  Chromatin readers are factors that interpret epigenetic marks on chromatin and translate them to alter gene activity.  Little is known about reader proteins in plants.  Curiously, in this case EML1 sponsors repression of viral gene expression. \n\nWe identified a new silencing suppressor function for geminivirus AL2 protein, a pathogenicity factor that counters methylation-mediated transcriptional gene silencing.  We also showed that silencing mechanisms can change during development, or in response to stress, in a species-specific manner.\n\nWe found that H3K27me3 is enriched on viral chromatin at the coat protein gene, indicating that geminiviruses recruit Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to control viral genes that are expressed late in infection.  PRC2 is a major regulator of host gene expression during development.  This work has led to a new NSF proposal. \n\nIn related work, we found that SnRK1 protein, a target of geminivirus AL2 and L2 pathogenicity factors, can phosphorylate mRNA cap binding proteins to inhibit protein synthesis in infected cells.  This appears to be a defense response that is blocked by AL2 and L2.  This work led to a new USDA/NIFA award.\n\nIn collaboration with Daniel Voytas (University of Minnesota) we helped to show that CRISPR technology is an effective tool to inhibit geminivirus replication.\n\nBroader Impacts:  The use of repressive methylation to inhibit viral gene expression is not limited to plants.  For example, methylation mediated silencing of viral chromatin is used as a defense against herpesviruses and in addition, herpesviruses recruit repressive methylation to control viral latency.  Thus, our studies may be prove instructive for other viral systems (and vice versa). \n\nThe project integrated research and education by contributing to the training of graduate and undergraduate students (some of whom were US minorities), postdoctoral associates, and visiting scientists.  In addition, the PI participated in the NSF REU Program sponsored by his home department, and twice participated as an instructor in the Ohio State University Summer Practical Workshop in Functional Genomics, which attracts international and domestic students, postdocs, and high school teachers and trains them in basic techniques and principles of molecular biology and genomics.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Bisaro"
