 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Sandra Eaton from University of Denver and colleague Gareth Eaton will develop an innovative digital electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer that can operate at any frequency up to 9 to 10 GHz using an AWG (arbitrary waveform generator) source and digital detection. A single digital spectrometer will be capable of performing a wide range of pulse, rapid-scan, and continuous-excitation EPR experiments at variable frequencies, instead of requiring multiple instruments for different frequencies as is currently the case.  Users will be able to implement new experiments in user-friendly software without requiring costly new hardware. Digital detection improves signal-to-noise and decreases data acquisition time. Individual resonators (probeheads) will be narrow-banded to maximize sensitivity.  The spectrometer will have a series of readily interchangeable resonator modules for experiments at frequencies that are currently widely used (such as 9.5 GHz) and ones (such as 4 GHz) where spectrometers are not currently available, but which theory predicts will be very valuable.  The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels. Projects include the frequency dependence of nitroxyl electron spin relaxation, spin trapping of the reactive oxygen species superoxide, and characterization of defect centers in diamonds with potential applications in quantum computing. \r\n\r\nEPR is the method of choice for studying molecules with unpaired electrons. Applications range from organic radicals and transition metal complexes, to materials for nanotechnology and solar energy conversion, characterization of metal sites in proteins, and measurement of long distances in polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids. The much greater flexibility of a digital EPR spectrometer will make it more useful in a wider range of applications. The detailed design of the new digital EPR spectrometer will be published to make it available to other research laboratories and to commercial vendors, which will open up new vistas for EPR spectroscopy. In addition, the project will contribute to workforce development by providing a cutting-edge interdisciplinary learning environment. Students will have the opportunity to interact with engineers, physicists, and chemists. Furthermore, students from nearby Regis University, with a high proportion of first-generation college students, will use the EPR laboratory on a regular basis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n   Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is the method of choice for studying molecules with unpaired electrons.  Applications range from organic radicals and transition metal complexes, to materials for nanotechnology and solar energy conversion, characterization of metal sites in proteins, and measurements of long distances between sites in polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids.\n\n  Currently available commercial spectrometers are designed to perform a specialized type of experiment at a specific operating frequency.  Addition of new capabilities at a different frequency requires large and expensive hardware changes.  A key limitation in current commercial spectrometers is that to achieve the required stability they are based on microwave sources that can be tuned over a relatively narrow range of frequencies.  Recently there have been dramatic improvements in the capabilities of arbitrary waveform generators (AWGs).   These devices are now available at frequencies that are high enough to be used as sources for EPR, and are computer controlled which provides enormous flexibility relative to currently-used sources.   The programming can be done in user-friendly high-level languages.\n\n   We have built an EPR spectrometer based on an AWG, which dramatically simplifies the signal detection hardware.   The initial implementation was at about 9.5 GHz, which is the most commonly used frequency for EPR.   Replacement of a few frequency-constrained components permits the same hardware and approach to be used at 1 GHz, which is advantageous for preclinical animal studies.\n\n   Current generation AWGs have relatively low power outputs that can be boosted with low-noise amplifiers.   The stability of the output can be improved by using commercially-available higher-stability clocks than are normal in the AWG.\n\n   The capabilities that have been demonstrated in this spectrometer point the way to a new generation of spectrometers in which novel experiments can be implemented in software instead of requiring costly hardware modifications and a single system can operate at a much wider range of frequencies than is currently possible with commercial instruments.   When disseminated to other laboratories these changes will make sophisticated EPR experiments accessible to a broader user base.\n\n    This project has provided training opportunities for one person who is now a faculty member at another University, one graduate student who has completed his degree, and two current graduate students.  They have benefitted from working on an interdisciplinary team that includes engineers, chemists, biophysicists, and biochemists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sandra S Eaton"
