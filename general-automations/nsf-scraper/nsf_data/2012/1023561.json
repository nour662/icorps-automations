 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Barrow Area Information Database (BAID, http://baid.utep.edu) is a regional cyberinfrastructure that offers users access to geospatial information about more than 9,600 research sites in the area. The BAID is an online geospatial information tool used by scientists, land managers, educators, students, subsistence hunters and the general public. The services provide information about scientific research in the region from Barrow to Atqasuk with a suite of online, interative maps and services, including searchable fields and more than 150 data layers describing vegetation, topography, land ownership, ground control points and infrastructure. This proposal will update and upgrade the current services offered via web servers. In addition, a wireless sensor network will provide near real-time meteorological data for the region. Data available through BAID will be made more interoperable and will link to the data archives at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Detailed climate data with spatial coverage for the region will benefit a broad group of researchers. The project will also develop students who can program, develop, and maintain cyberinfrastructure tools and infrastructure for basic researcher, land managers and land users.",
