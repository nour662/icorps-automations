 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Christine Offerman of Tufts University to conduct a research project, entitled \"A formula regarding the averages of functions over spheres in a symmetric space,\" during the summer of 2012 at Okayama University in Okayama, Okayama Prefecture. The host scientist is Prof. Tomoyuki Kakehi. \r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to prove a generalization in harmonic analysis and integral geometry on symmetric spaces with the intent to prove a generalization of the \u00c1sgiersson Mean Value Theorem. Proving this theorem admits solutions to the multi-temporal wave equation and other interesting partial differential equations.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
