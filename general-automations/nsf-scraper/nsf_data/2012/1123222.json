 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to study a broad set of upper atmospheric science topics that are all manifestations of highly coupled systems within and connected to the Ionosphere-Thermosphere-Mesosphere (ITM) regions.  The contributions to these studies arise from in-house development and deployment of eight low-light-level all-sky-imagers (ASIs).  The project has eight areas of activity: (a) the global magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions that create stable auroral red (SAR) arcs, (b) the electrodynamical-ITM processes that create Medium Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs), (c) the geomagnetic conjugate point controlled aspects of the severe ionospheric irregularities known as equatorial spread-F (ESF), (d) the day-to-day variability of the ionosphere during periods of extended solar and geomagnetic quiescence, (e) dynamical processes in the Mesosphere, (f) experiments of opportunity, (g) comparative aeronomy, and (h) running the CEDAR optical calibration lab.  Of particular focus is determining if symmetries or asymmetries exist with longitude and/or hemisphere for the features observed.  These include how the tilted geomagnetic dipole creates a mix of processes controlled by geographic latitude (e.g., solar production) versus geomagnetic latitude (e.g., magnetospheric input) within and between the hemispheres.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported a broad range of studies of the Earth?s \"upper atmosphere\" --- meaning the vast region above our local environment of every-day weather and climate (Troposphere-Statosphere).  Yet, our upper atmosphere also has a dramatic type of \"Space Weather\" that affects many of the technological components of daily life.  Our main region of interest deals with a layer of the upper atmosphere called the ionosphere.  This is the domain where many satellites are in orbit at heights of several hundred miles above the surface.  Ultraviolet light and X-rays from the Sun cause the gases in the upper atmosphere to be stripped of an electron and thus the region is one of free electrons and ions---and hence the name ionosphere.  A gas of ions and electrons is called a plasma, and most of the universe is composed of plasmas (in stars, planetary atmospheres, and in the space between planets, stars and galaxies).  The Earth?s ionosphere is our closest cosmic plasma and thus our studies relate to both basic science, as well as Space Weather impacts upon modern society.\n\n \n\nVia support from this grant, Boston University operates one of the world?s major network of all-sky-imagers (ASIs) for ionospheric research.  These very sensitive camera systems record emissions from the upper atmosphere that are too faint to be seen by the naked eye.  While far less bright that aurora (\"northern and southern lights\"), each ASI portrays patterns of emission spanning nearly a million square miles.  The resultant images  map the locations of ionospheric regions where ionospheric disturbances and irregularities occur.  The unique nature of the BU network is that station pairs (one in each hemisphere) were established to observe effects at both ends of the Earth?s magnetic field lines (called conjugate points).  For example, ASI systems at observatories in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) and Mercedes (Argentina) conduct \"conjugate point\" science in the American longitude sector.  Equivalent systems at the Asiago Observatory in Italy and the South African Large Telescope observatory in Sutherland provide data for the Europe-Africa longitude region. \n\n \n\nUsing conjugate point data sets, we have studied how a single source of disturbance causes different types of effects at each end of a magnetic field line.  This is because they have different \"receptor conditions\" since they are in different seasons (e.g., winter ionosphere in the north versus summer ionosphere in the south).  In the attachments, Figure 1 shows the network of ASI systems used, and Figures 2, 3 and 4 show sample results of conjugate point images and associated science yield.\n\n \n\nWith support from the NSF for this projects, both basic science and applications topics were addressed (as shown in Figures 2-4).  In addition, the grant provided significant training opportunities for students (graduate and undergraduates), plus professional development for staff member supported by the grant.  Results were distributed in the public domain by publications in journals, presentations at professional meeting, and in outreach talks and activities in the Boston area.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Mendillo"
