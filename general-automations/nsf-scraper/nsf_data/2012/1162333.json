 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cloud computing offers IT organizations the ability to create\r\ngeo-distributed, and highly scalable applications while providing\r\nattractive cost-saving advantages. Yet, architecting, configuring, and\r\nadapting cloud applications (latency-sensitive web applications and\r\nbulk data processing applications) to meet their stringent performance\r\nrequirements is a challenge given the rich set of configuration\r\noptions, shared multi-tenant nature of cloud platforms, and dynamics\r\nresulting from activities such as planned maintenance.\r\n\r\nThis project is developing novel methodologies, algorithms, and\r\nsystems that can enable application architects to (1) judiciously\r\narchitect applications across multiple cloud data-centers while\r\nconsidering application performance requirements, cost saving\r\nobjectives, and cloud pricing schemes guided by performance and cost\r\nmodels of cloud components; (2) automatically learn effective\r\napplication configurations and configuration-to-performance prediction\r\nmodels through statistical machine learning techniques; and (3) create\r\napplications that can adapt to ongoing dynamics in cloud environments\r\nthrough transaction reassignment over shorter time-scales, and\r\napplication migration over longer time-scales.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this research is multi-fold: (1) Enable IT organizations\r\nto significantly reduce costs by optimally moving their operations to\r\nthe cloud; (2) create benchmarks based on operationally deployed\r\napplications and collecting workload traces which will be made\r\navailable to the research community; (3) make developed algorithms and\r\nsystems widely available as open source software; (4) inform the\r\ndesign of a nation-wide health-care cloud in Thailand; (4) introduce\r\ncloud computing related topics in the undergraduate and graduate\r\ncurriculum; and (6) train multiple Ph.D., M.S., and undergraduate\r\nstudents, with explicit effort to recruit and train students from\r\nunder-represented minority groups.",
