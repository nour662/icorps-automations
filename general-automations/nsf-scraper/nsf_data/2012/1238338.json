 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed planning activity seeks to undertake planning of the establishment of a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) site at Texas Tech University of the existing Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing. The center currently involves Arizona, Florida, Mississippi State and Rutgers, and industry and government partners in the field. The Texas Tech site intends to provide a practical work arena for development and coordination of standards, standards-based software and reference implementations applicable to cloud and other forms of advanced distributed computing. The site will fill a need to organize, classify, develop reference implementations for and otherwise contribute to standards-based software in advanced distributed computing.\r\n\r\nThe planned site, in combination with the existing center plans to help build innovation capacity in cloud computing.   The outcomes from the Texas Tech site has the potential to support effective, broad-based standards development for this emerging field.  The site plans to have a significant impact on students via mechanisms including the TTU STEM Education and Outreach Project and the SURAgrid regional grid and cloud computing educational dissemination project.",
