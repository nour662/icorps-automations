 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of Florida's  Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience in St. Augustine, Florida that will provide research training for 8 students, for 11 weeks during the summers of 2012- 2015. The program focuses on understanding basic mechanisms of biology through studies of marine and other comparative models.  The Whitney Laboratory consists of a highly cooperative group of 10 faculty who guide student projects in areas of molecular, cellular, neuro-, and population biology and bioinformatics.  Students do full-time lab research, participate in weekly research seminars and weekly workshops focusing on the responsible conduct of research and professional communication skills.  An introductory series of lectures exposes students to basic concepts of evolution and biodiversity which underlie the comparative approaches applied at the Whitney Laboratory. Guided field trips into local marine estuaries, to inland fresh water springs and to the Gulf coast of Florida also introduce students to diverse ecosystems. Students meet with graduate coordinators of various departments at the University of Florida to gain insights into the graduate school application process.  They also meet with former Whitney REU students to discuss diverse career paths in science and science related fields.  Students are recruited nationwide through digital based advertising and direct faculty contacts.  Trips are made to several minority-serving institutions and recruitment efforts also aim to attract non-traditional students from among returning veterans and their family members. Students are selected based on their academic record and research potential. Special attention is given to applicants from groups currently underrepresented in the sciences and groups for whom evidence suggests the REU experience has the greatest impact. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in science, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting: http://www.whitney.ufl.edu/index.php/education/undergraduate.  Alternatively, contact the PI (Dr. Barbara Battelle, battelle@whitney.ufl.edu) or Whitney's Education Coordinator (Brenda Cannaliato, Brenda@whitney.ufl.edu).",
