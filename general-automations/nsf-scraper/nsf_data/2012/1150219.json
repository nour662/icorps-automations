 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of cloud computing services---services that host infrastructure on \r\nwhich third-parties can run applications and store data---has skyrocketed in \r\nthe last few years. However, despite the growing number of cloud services, most \r\napplications are deployed today on a single cloud service.  This status quo has several\r\ndrawbacks---availability and performance offered by an application are limited\r\nby the cloud service on which the application is deployed, and cost borne by\r\nan application provider to meet performance goals is limited by the types and\r\npricing of resources offered by that service.\r\n\r\nThis research project will enable distributed applications to obtain better\r\navailability and performance at lower cost by planning and managing application \r\ndeployments that span multiple cloud services.  Recognizing the fact that different\r\ncomponents of an application have different characteristics, this project will\r\nenable cost-effective multi-cloud deployments by matching the heterogeneity of\r\nan application's components with the diversity of resources offered by\r\ndifferent cloud services.  The research in this project involves three main\r\ntasks---1) the development of algorithms to choose cost-effectively among the \r\nmyriad candidate configurations for deploying an application across cloud \r\nservices, 2) the design and implementation of a distributed measurement and \r\nmonitoring framework to dynamically reconfigure an application's deployment as\r\nthe state of cloud services and of the Internet change over time, and 3) the\r\ndevelopment of tools and techniques that enable legacy applications \r\nimplemented for deployment on a single cloud service to be easily ported to \r\nmulti-cloud deployments.  The research will involve significant\r\nsystems-building and experimentation with the proposed techniques applied to\r\ndeployments of popular applications on real cloud services.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nIn spite of the increasing popularity of cloud services, there remain several\r\nconcerns about their use.  The algorithms and software systems developed as\r\npart of this research may transform the ways in which application providers\r\nuse cloud services, thus easing concerns with respect to availability and\r\nperformance.  The project also has a significant education component with the\r\nintroduction of new graduate and undergraduate classes, and public talks to\r\nincrease awareness about cloud services among small and non-profit businesses.\r\n",
