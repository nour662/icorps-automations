It will deal with issues impacting the market as a whole, rather than focusing only on the behavior of a single market participant. The objective is to bring together domestic and international researchers working in the areas of probability, financial mathematics and economics, control and estimation of stochastic optimization processes, as well as stochastic analysis.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the crisis of 2007/2008, new regulatory changes are facing financial markets and it is important to maintain and improve the training and support available to young researchers who may play an important role in implementing, in the future, those changes related to mathematical modeling of the markets. By mixing researchers with different skills and perspectives, including those from under-represented groups, the conference aims to foster enriching interactions between people who would rarely interact\r\notherwise. Even though the field of Financial Mathematics has attracted many graduate students in the last decade, many of them have looked for careers in industry; this conference may help attract top students to careers in academia or regulatory agencies, and increase the pool of US researchers in the field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFinancial Mathematics and Economics enjoyed a great success,both in theory and in practice in the period between 1990 and 2007. The emphasis was on finding optimal ways to trade and hedge, often from the perspective of an investment bank. The events of 2007 and 2008 then showed in an emphatic way how in practice  this perspective was pushed too far, and that there was a need for a broader perspective, that would analyze  interactions between numerous market participants, and the consequences of such interactions. The conference dealt with issues impacting the market as a whole, rather than focusing only on the behavior of a single market participant, and related questions arising in Probability andStochastic Control.\n In order to achieve such  a broad perspective,  the conference brought together domestic and international researchers working in the areas of financial mathematics and economics, control and estimation of  stochastic optimization processes, as well as stochastic analysis. By mixing researchers with different skills and perspectives in a relatively small meeting,  the conference aimed to foster enriching interactions between people who would rarely interact otherwise.\nA significant  number of the participantsof the conference are in the early stages of their careers, namely, graduate students and junior academics, including forty-three presenters in the poster sessions.The event will facilitate  the further development of young faculty and stimulate the careers of the next generation ofmathematicians. As a consequence of the crisis of 2007/2008,new regulatory changes are facing financial markets and  it is important to maintain and improve the training and support available to young researchers who may play an important role in implementing those changes in the future.
