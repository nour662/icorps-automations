The host scientist is Dr. Tulika Mitra of NUS.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to explore integrating a reconfigurable fabric into a mobile processor to decrease computation time and energy requirements for computationally intensive applications.  The mobile processor is the Hybrid-Reconfigurable Processor (HR-P).  Further development promises a novel mobile computer architecture and compilation tool-chain for solving current and future computing related problems, contributing to computer science and bringing industrial transformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
