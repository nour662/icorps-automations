The NSF 2012 CBET Grantee Conference will be held from Wednesday, June 6, 2012 to Friday, June 8, 2012 at the Hyatt Regency Baltimore and the Baltimore Convention Center. \r\n\r\nThe NSF CBET Grantee Conference provides the opportunity for building more effective and collaborative relationships amongst the community of CBET grantees and Program Directors. The conference is designed to enable awardees to share their technical achievements with NSF Program Directors and also to learn about current (and/or new) NSF/CBET programs, practices, and supplemental funding mechanisms. CBET Program and Cluster-specific sessions will also facilitate discussions amongst these smaller communities to address topics of specific interest. The conference agenda will provide multiple outlets for networking and interaction with program officers and other grantees in efforts to promote discussions and potential collaborations. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\n\r\nThe Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division is a major element of the Engineering (ENG) Directorate and critical to the Engineering Directorates mission at the National Science Foundation (NSF).
