 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is collaborating with Salish Kootenai College to convene a second conference of the Geoscience Alliance, which fosters engagement of Native American students in the geosciences and related STEM fields by bringing together geoscientists, Native leaders, educators and students for the purpose of advancing research, identifying best practices, improving evaluation, promoting educational opportunities, and fostering new collaborations. The conference is being held at Salish Kootenai College in March 2012, with an anticipated attendance of ~125 participants.  The Geoscience Alliance effort builds on best practices for improving participation by Native Americans in STEM fields, and particularly in the geosciences, including: 1) cultural context; 2) community relevance; 3) a holistic approach that considers the entire student; 4) involvement of the community, family, and elders; 5) a communal learning environment; and, 6) problem-based or real-world-based activities. The conference will address the following research strands: Topics in Education and Evaluation Related to Native American Geoscience and STEM Learning, and Topics in Geosciences Research Affecting Indigenous Communities. Attendees at the conference will include: Native American K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty from Tribal colleges and other universities, teachers, elders, and other interested researchers. Scientists from major Federal agency-supported research and education centers and facilities, including CUAHSI, EarthScope, UCAR/NCAR, GLOBE, LacCore, will share information about opportunities and programs for Native students and educators working in Native communities.  Continuation of the Geoscience Alliance after the conference will be fostered by organizing sessions and receptions at professional conferences (e.g., SACNAS), through communication by technological and traditional means, and via new ongoing research and education collaborations.  Co-funding for this conference is being provided through a separate contribution from NASA (via the Virginia Space Grant Consortium).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGEO 1214555. Home Places, Local Landscapes, Traditional Knowledge and Modern Technologies--The Second Geoscience Alliance National Conference\n\nThe Geoscience Alliance is a national group dedicated to increasing participation by Native Americans in the Geosciences.  Our latest conference, Home Places, Local Landscapes, Traditional Knowledge and Modern Technologies took place at Salish Kootenai College in Pablo, Montana in March 2012.\n\n1)  The 2nd Geoscience Alliance Conference in March 2012 at Salish Kootenai College was attended by 145 members (71 were Native American; 20 were tribal college faculty, 53 were undergraduate and graduate students, the rest were teachers, elders, k-12 students, professionals, and faculty/staff from other colleges and universities).  83% from post-conference survey respondents reported that they would attend future Geoscience Alliance conferences.\n\n2)  We increased participation of national research centers in the Geoscience Alliance by inviting representatives from NASA, the Consortium of Universities for Advanced Hydrology Science, Inc. (CUAHSI), the\nUniversity Consortium for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), the National Lacustrine Core Facility (LacCore), the GLOBE Program, and the Watershed Education Network to present workshops at the Geoscience Alliance Conference.  The workshops were the centerpiece for the\nconference, and subsequent discussion sessions focused on the technologies introduced in the workshops.   Subsequently these research centers have increased their collaborations with Native American communities and are planning to continue participation in the Geoscience Alliance.\n\n3)     Student research was presented in a poster session and in a 3-hour session of \"pop-up\" student research talks.\n\n4)     Subsequent to the conference, we increased membership in the Geoscience Alliance to 233 members and established a national\nLISTSERV for interaction of members. Many opportunities were shared with our membership through the LISTSERV from Geoscience Alliance members and others, and in particular from NSF GEO REU\u00c6s.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  The Geoscience Alliance conference evaluation was focused on effective networking for promoting broader participation of Native Americans in the Geosciences.\n\nBroader Impacts:  The conference was well-attended by Native American students and faculty.  The theme of the conference was effectively incorporating cutting-edge science with traditional knowledge to benefit communities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/06/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Diana M Dalbotten"
