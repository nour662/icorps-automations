 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor John W. Frost of the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University will interface microbial catalysis with chemical catalysis to convert renewable, nontoxic sugar starting materials into chemicals currently derived from the benzene-toluene-xylene (BTX) stream of petroleum and gas refining.  Dienes will be microbe synthesized and chemically reacted with dienophiles to yield cycloaddition products designed to provide access to a new generation of monomers and plasticizers where all carbon atoms are derived from renewable sugars.  Catalytic dehydrogenation of the cycloaddition products is to afford substituted terephthalates.  Other cycloaddition products will provide access to substituted cyclohexene tricarboxylates and cyclohexane tricarboxylates.  \r\n\r\nSubstituted terephthalic acids can impart unique properties when employed as additives or monomers in liquid crystalline polymers used in electronic and medical applications as well as in polyethyleneterephthalate used in clothing fiber and bottle resin.  The novel properties that substituted terephthalates impart to engineering and consumer polymers could open new applications and new markets thereby providing an important economic multiplier along with job creation.  Similarly, the wide array of ring-substituted cyclohexene and cyclohexane tricarboxylates are targeted towards nonaromatic plasticizer markets.  By interfacing microbial synthesis with chemical synthesis, a level of structural diversity is accessed that may ultimately enable the identification of new high-performance plasticizers that do not bind to estrogen receptors.  The attendant health safety and environmental benefits would be considerable.  Finally, this research program will provide a unique training opportunity for pre-undergraduate, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSynthesis of aromatic chemicals is moved to a new level of sustainability by combining use of renewable starting materials with environmentally benign reaction conditions.  As a consequence of discoveries made in this research program, what was last growing season?s carbon dioxide or the methane produced by waste water treatment facilities can now become the carbon atoms of the poly(ethylene terephthalate) PET polymer used to manufacture clear beverage containers, clear clamshell food/produce containers, clothing fiber and the flexible circuitry found in a myriad of consumer electronic products.  Two new synthetic routes have been elaborated for the synthesis of the  terephthalic acid portion of PET polymer.  Approximately 50 billion kilograms of terephthalic acid are globally produced each year.  One elaborated synthesis of terephthalic acid uses glucose as the starting material, which can be derived from corn starch, sugar cane, and switchgrass.  A second elaborated synthesis of terephthalic acid can use methane as the starting material.  Methane can be derived from renewable biogas or derived from the abundant supplies of shale gas now available in the US.  These syntheses are enabled by the development of new catalysts that eliminate use of solvents, enable reactions to be run at room temperature and eliminate the risk of side reactions that can lead to fire or explosion.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John W Frost"
