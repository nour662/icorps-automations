 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North Carolina State University vascular plant herbarium (NCSC) is specialized in the flora of North Carolina and the southeastern US, continuing its mission to document and understand plant diversity and to transfer the taxonomic expertise developed to various users that depend on the generated knowledge.  This project focuses on the: (1) compactorization of NCSC to alleviate specimen damage from current space constraints and allow for continued research- and training-driven growth, and the (2) imaging and databasing of a component of the collection, providing a training opportunity for undergraduates and engagement of the public through a citizen science approach.  \r\n\r\nThe resulting publically available database of specimen label information, species distribution maps, and images has many practical applications, including increased capacity for survey and documentation, climate studies, and precision natural resource management.  Also, because of NCSC's initiative to require silica-gel collections in addition to standard vouchers in floristic research, NCSC holdings will be significantly informative to studies at various levels of organization from molecules to ecosystems.  In addition, to close the gap between modern collections-based research and K-12 education, NCSC is partnering with NC 4-H and high school teachers to develop lessons on genetic diversity, classification, and adaptive evolution.

The holdings of NCSC include significant historical collections unique to the development of taxonomy, ecology, and general plant science in the SEUS, as well as outstanding recent and historical collections from North Carolina state parks and natural areas. NCSC remains one of the few research-extensive institutions in the Southeast to maintain an intensive floristic training program and the only research-extensive institution in North Carolina emphasizing floristics at the master&rsquo;s level.

NCSC is active in understanding and documenting plant diversity both locally, nationally, and internationally. Efforts by NCSC-affiliated researchers to transfer taxonomic expertise through graduate-level training and primary research seek to contribute to easing the &ldquo;taxonomic impediment&rdquo; to the sound management of biodiversity that has been identified by governments through the Convention on Biological Diversity.

The awarded funds were used to support (1) the purchase and installation of a mobile aisle storage system, (2) twenty-six additional herbarium cabinets to fill out the mobile carriages, and (3) part-time, temporary student technicians to facilitate imaging, databasing, and the associated release of the inherent biodiversity data to the scientific community at large through online data portals. &nbsp;The project will impact undergraduate and graduate training, as well as outreach to all groups&mdash;including those historically underrepresented in science&mdash;through secondary education. &nbsp;As a component of the project, NCSC partnered with the 4-H program in the state to develop six curriculum lessons that incorporated NC Essential Standards for Science for High School Biology.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the period of the grant, all objectives outlined above were met. &nbsp;A mobile aisle system was successfully installed, alleviating space constraints and positioning NCSC for future growth.
