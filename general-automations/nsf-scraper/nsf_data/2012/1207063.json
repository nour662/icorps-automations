 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nPhotochemical reactions within molecular crystals provide a way to transform light energy into nanoscale mechanical motion.  Progress in nanoscale photomechanical materials requires an interdisciplinary approach that combines materials chemistry and physical characterization.  In this joint proposal, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, the Bardeen research group's expertise in molecular crystalline materials, optical spectroscopy and microscopy will be complemented by the Mueller group's strengths in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and computational chemistry, in order to pursue a research program with two main thrusts:\r\n1)  New photomechanical materials.  We will concentrate on thermally reversible photomechanical systems that can operate with a single light source.  To make photomechanical elements that can function on the nanoscale, we will look for systems where changes in the crystal shape can be induced intrinsically without relying on specialized irradiation conditions.  Two new types of photochemical \"engines\" will also be investigated:  the unimolecular Dewar isomerization of anthracene, and thermally induced polymorphic phase changes.  We will also develop the capability to make uniform arrays of molecular crystal plates as a step toward making devices based on photomechanical molecular crystals.\r\n2)  Physical characterization of the solid-state reaction dynamics and their connection to crystal deformation.  This part of the project will involve using optical, x-ray, NMR and computational methods to understand how molecular-level reactions drive large-scale crystal shape changes in model systems.  After the photochemical reaction has been initiated, the structure of the photoproduct and how the reaction affects the crystal packing will be determined using solid-state NMR, x-ray diffraction, and computational methods.  We will also use optical and scanning probe microscopy to map out how the crystal geometry changes as a function of these parameters.  Information from these experiments will be combined to provide a holistic picture of the photomechanical process on multiple length scales and timescales.\r\n\r\nNON TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nMachines that function on length scales smaller than biological cells could lead to revolutionary advances in fields like medicine and defense.  But there are many questions that must be answered before this goal can be achieved, including how to produce such structures, how to provide them with power, and how to control their motion.  Our approach involves self-assembling photochemically reactive molecules within a crystal, whose shape and size is controlled by the preparation conditions.  Because the molecules are organized within a crystal, they move in concert to expand or bend the overall nanostructure.  The research in this proposal will assess whether these nanoscale photochemical \"engines\" can be used to manipulate objects on nanometer to micron length scales.  We also want to gain a predictive understanding of how molecular-level chemical changes can combine together to create much larger shape changes in the crystals.  In addition, outreach programs based on this research will be used to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in science.  U.C. Riverside is a Hispanic Serving Institution, with strong connections to the surrounding public schools.  We are currently designing and implementing outreach modules for 1st, 2nd and 4th grade classes that are consistent with the California State Standards for science education.  With undergraduate volunteers, we are bringing these modules to local elementary schools, like Taft Elementary, a local Title I school whose student body is more than 50% Hispanic.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research project had the goal to develop new materials that absorb light and undergo mechanical motions.  These so-called photomechanical materials could be useful as remotely-controlled actuators that perform motions in complex environments and that operate on small (micron) lengthscales.  We are concentrating on photomechanical systems where a single light source is used to initiate the photochemical reaction, which then reverses spontaneously.  In this way the mechanical motion can be repeated over and over again.  Light acts as the fuel for a photochemical motor.  In this case, the photomechanical motion arises from the chemical reaction between two molecules, the [4+4] photodimerization reaction.  The design of these materials requires the synthesis of new molecules and also the control of their assembly into a crystal that can have various shapes:  a needle, a ribbon, or even a branched structure.  In order to design new and improved materials, we must also characterize the solid-state reaction dynamics of the molecules and these reactions work together to drive crystal deformation.  This part of the project involves a collaboration to use optical, x-ray, NMR and computational methods to understand how chemical changes occurring over a range of time- and lengthscales combine to drive large-scale crystal shape changes.  Questions to be addressed include whether the photochemical reaction in the crystal occurs in a homogeneous or heterogeneous fashion, the structure of intermediate and transient crystal states, and the correlation between reaction kinetics and the overall mechanical response of the molecular crystal. \n\nDuring this project, we have synthesized fluorinated derivatives of anthracene carboxylic acid show improved mechanical properties and much faster recovery times, as well as much greater photostability.  Molecular crystals composed of 4-fluoro-9-anthracene carboxylic acid can undergo more than 100 cycles of bending/twisting without loss of response.   A different class of molecules, the divinylanthracenes, can undergo cis-trans photoisomerizations that lead to a dramatic coiling of the crystals.  We have also investigated how the molecular photoreaction affects its reversal, finding that the reaction rate of the Dewar photoisomer of 9-tert-butylanthracene back to anthracene is pressure dependent, a novel result that shows that the reversal of these reactions can be accelerated by mechanical pressure.  In terms of the mechanisms of solid-state photoreactions, we have successfully determined the crystal structure of the 9TBAE dimer intermediate formed by the solid state photodimerization of the 9TBAE crystal.  This is an important step in determining the mechanism of the light-induced 15% expansion of 9-tert-butylanthracene ester nanorods.  We have a possible mechanism for the expansion and are currently performing NMR experiments to confirm that mechanism.  We have also characterized the kinetics of anthracene photodimerization in 9-methylanthracene crystals, and are now developing the theory to explain how reaction kinetics affect the bending rate and magnitude.  This will provide a way to predict photomechanical motion from the molecular level to the crystal level.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this project consisted in using a combination of physical chemistry and materials science described above to design and create new photomechanical materials.  The broader impacts of this research extend to possible technological applications in medicine, biology, and manufacturing.  These new materials can have applications in micromachines, actuation and mechanical switching, and as photon-fueled engines for micron scale robots.  The project has also supported outreach activities to grades 1-5 at Taft Elementary school, a Title I school whose population consists of a majority of underrepresented groups in science.  These activities impact over 500 students in the course of one year.  One such activity was a visit by the 4th grade class from Taft to UC Riverside that introduced both the students and their parents to the possibilities of college.  Finally, the graduate students received training in experimental techniques like sample preparation, crystal growth, electron microscopy, optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and spectroscopy.  This training will allow them to contribute to the science and technology fields in both academic or industrial settings.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher J Bardeen"
