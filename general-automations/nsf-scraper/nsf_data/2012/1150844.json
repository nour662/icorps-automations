 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the Principle Investigator will examine the heterogeneity within impulsive decision making as well as the biological developmental processes that lead to individual differences in decision making phenotypes.  Although decisions to pursue a goal are typically dichotomous (yes/no), factors that contribute to decisions are multiple.  In addition to the value of the targeted reward, individuals must consider the costs associated with effort, time, and risk.  The reduction in perceived value as costs increase is known as cost discounting, and has been demonstrated to differ substantially between individuals.  Because individual variability exists in each of these domains (effort, time, and risk) independently, more variability exists in the process of decision making than is evident in the variability of decision outcomes, requiring more detailed assessment of discounting strategies than can be extracted from tests currently used in research.  Furthermore, developmental theory proposes that variability in cost discounting arises as a function of environmental adaptation, allowing for the development of specific hypotheses regarding the relationship between early developmental adversity and the dopaminergic processing that contributes to cost discounting.  This study will evaluate discounting tendencies in a longitudinal, prospectively collected, epidemiological sample to test the association between genotype, biological development, and decision making phenotypic outcomes.  \r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, this research will expand the understanding of how children process information in making decisions.  Impulsive decision making has been demonstrated to contribute to behavior problems and academic underachievement.  Currently all children characterized by impulsivity tend to garner the same recommendations and behavioral management approaches.   However, because the neural processes involved in decision making are multifaceted, different children can arrive at an impulsive (sub-optimal) decision for different reasons.  This project will develop a detailed assessment of decision making that allows for more individualized characterization of children, which will directly inform the development of a range of strategies for behavior management applicable for classroom use.  The impact of this information is two-fold;  (1) understanding the heterogeneity of impulsive decision making will provide a framework from which research on behavioral change can refine and diversify individual-based approaches, and (2) the developmental, process-based, information extracted from this study will help identify windows of developmental sensitivity and mechanisms of influence that can inform policy and prevention practice to enhance developmental trajectories for under-served children.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis study developed and validated a new paradigm for assessing decision making in children.  There are important differences between children in how they make decisions to pursue an opportunity for a reward when that reward also comes with a cost.  In daily life, costs come in different forms including delay (\"I want it but I don?t want to wait for it), effort (\"I want it but I don?t want to work for it\"), and probability (\"I want it, but not if I am not certain I will get it\").  The assessment paradigm developed as a part of this study advances the current state of the field in several important ways. (1) This paradigm is uniquely designed to differentiate what motivates a given decision, specifically whether a child pursues an opportunity because they are highly sensitive to reward, or whether they are less sensitive to the cost.  Traditional tasks cannot make this distinction. (2) This task establishes a common framework that can be used to study children?s sensitivity to each individual cost domain, and is one of few paradigms designed specifically to capture willingness to exert cognitive effort.  Finally, (3) this task employs an adaptive algorithm to maximize the information gathered while minimizing the duration of the task needed to extract reliable data.  Results indicate that children?s sensitivity to each cost domain is uniquely associated with different behaviors.  Children who demonstrate an unwillingness to engage in cognitive effort on this task are rated by their teachers as less academically motivated, and perform more poorly on measures of academic achievement even after controlling for their cognitive ability.  Effortful engagement in the learning process is critical for academic success, and an unwillingness to work leads to lower academic achievement, which accumulates overtime and can reduce opportunities for higher education and long term career prospects.  We coordinated with educational service providers to develop professional development training modules for teachers to help educate them on children?s brain function and implications for classroom behavioral management.  Further work has examined how early developmental factors, including genetics, maternal smoking, and complications during pregnancy, influence children?s later decision making styles.  This information can help inform efforts to support healthy brain development prenatally.             \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/23/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lisa Gatzke-Kopp"
