They will use existing data sources as well as subscribe to the COACHE survey.  They will interview women who have left Otterbein, and convene focus groups of invisible women.  They plan to institutionalize some data collection efforts.  In addition they will utilize the existing mechanism of Professional Learning Communities to bring ADVANCE topics to the faculty.  Otterbein is a PUI and aligns their activities well with the specific needs of PUIs. In particular the focus on ?invisible women? is very relevant as many institutions are increasing their non-tenure-track faculty, especially PUIs.  Results could prove to have national significance.",
