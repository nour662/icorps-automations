 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project at Prairie View A&M University is developing a smart grid simulator. The project aims to achieve the following objectives: (a) revamp multidisciplinary lectures and corresponding labs in the context of smart grids; (b) improve student learning in power and energy areas; (c) promote multidisciplinary research collaborations on smart grids; (d) develop faculty expertise through research and teaching initiatives; and (e) disseminate results and findings for the academic community and the general public. The project will directly impact 390 undergraduate students, most of whom are from underrepresented groups, in the departments of electrical and computer engineering and engineering technology.\r\n\r\nThe smart grid simulator will integrate simulation software, power electronic devices, motors, embedded microprocessors, and cybernetics to construct a simulated environment with hardware-in-the-loop. A collaborative consortium allows for the most qualified research expertise to tackle the grand challenges in smart grid education and research. Centered on the power grid simulator, segmented resources in several teaching laboratories are infused, and traditional power engineering education is enriched with complementary courses to strengthen student knowledge and skills in communication and information technologies.",
