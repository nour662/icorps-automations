 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Deborah Ann Sunter of the University of California, Berkeley to conduct a research project, entitled \"Economic and environmental comparison of residential combined heat and power systems in Japan,\" during the summer of 2012 at the University of Kitakyushu in Kitakyushu, Japan.  The host scientist is Professor Weijun Gao.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is an analysis of the economic and environmental potentials of solar thermal micro combined heat and power (CHP) systems for the residential sector in Japan. Despite the significant economic merit of both the gas engine and fuel cell micro CHP residential systems when introduced in Japanese homes, the environmental potential for both systems was found to be disappointingly low. This research investigates uses of micro CHP systems using renewable energy sources, in this case solar thermanl energy, to more dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
