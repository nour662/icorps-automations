 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: \r\nSpectrum sensing is the most important element of cognitive radio, as it forms the ba-\r\nsis for adaptive spectrum sharing. Wideband spectrum sensing without frequency sweeping or\r\nNyquist-rate sampling is a challenging problem, especially for network sensing from low-end sen-\r\nsors with limited communication capabilities. Assume that each sensor can only down-convert,\r\nfilter, and send out a binary signal when it measures energy above threshold at its filter?s output.\r\nIs it possible to form a satisfactory estimate of the ambient power spectrum using just a few such\r\nbits? This is the question at the core of this project, and exciting preliminary results suggest that\r\nthe answer is on the affirmative. A well-rounded research program has been designed to build\r\nupon these preliminary findings. The research will evolve along four thrusts: i) core system design\r\nand performance analysis; ii) distributed implementation; iii) relevant extensions, such as adaptive\r\nsensing; and iv) software radio experiments.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: \r\nPower spectrum estimation from few wideband energy detection bits has never\r\nbeen considered - yet is a fundamental extension of spectral analysis. Exciting new applications\r\nof convex optimization theory and methods will be found in the area of network-based spectrum\r\nestimation.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nWideband spectrum sensing using cheap sensors and few bits is a transformative\r\nidea that has the potential to permeate the benefits of cognitive radio down to commodity hardware\r\n- something currently far from reality. The topic is highly conducive for involving students and\r\ntraining the next generation of wireless engineers.",
