 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the mental health of people in conflict and disaster zones has attracted increasing attention among international humanitarian aid organizations. However, as compared with food or medical aid, mental health interventions pose unique design, coordination, and validation challenges.  Amid ongoing debate over what falls within the domain of mental health, aid organizations are employing diverse interventions, ranging from individual therapy, to vocational training, to human rights advocacy. This diversity stems in part from variation in conditions on the ground and in part from disagreement about appropriate goals and methods. To improve oversight and communication, several multinational humanitarian consortia and research groups have worked to develop techniques for scientifically assessing the efficacy of mental health interventions in conflict and disaster zones. But given the varying needs of different populations and a lack of consensus about appropriate measures of success, producing convincing assessments poses significant challenges.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThis project examines the challenges that humanitarian organizations and researchers encounter when trying to implement and assess mental health interventions. It examines the methods that they employ to overcome these challenges, and the manner in which they evaluate the effectiveness of their assessment methods. To address these issues questions, the researcher will interview mental health practitioners, administrators, and researchers involved in humanitarian mental health interventions and conduct participant observation in humanitarian organizations that operate in Israel and the West Bank. The project will document the challenges of designing, delivering, and assessing mental health and psychological interventions in conflict zones, illuminating the complexities of knowledge transfer in the humanitarian sphere. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nBecause humanitarian actors use concepts of efficacy and oversight on a daily basis to plan and implement mental health interventions and justify funding for them, the analysis is likely to interest a variety of researchers, NGOs, and policy analysts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHumanitarian aid workers and policy makers face a high degree of unpredictability regarding specific aid contexts. A food distribution project intended to battle child malnutrition might fail to reach the neediest villages due to local militias demanding bribery in return for access. Or a psychosocial project in a war-torn village might fail to bring healing if locals refuse to speak with counselors.  Given the inherent unpredictability of humanitarian settings, how do policy makers make humanitarian policy? How do they attempt to govern the humanitarian sphere despite the difficulties of finding out what locals need, what other organizations are doing at the same time, and what resources are available on the ground? \n\nWith the help of this NSF dissertation improvement grant, the researcher examined how medical and psychosocial aid practitioners and planners factor contingency and unpredictability into their work.  She conducted interviews with humanitarian practitioners and researchers working in Israel, Palestine, Uganda, Afghanistan, Poland, the United States, England, and Kenya, among other countries.  She found, overall, that aid workers have a considerable tolerance of contingency and unpredictability.  Despite growing calls within the global aid community for evidence-based aid and quantitative efficacy benchmarks, the aid workers she interviewed did not expect science to provide straight-forward guidance.  Rather, they often expected things to go differently than planned, and positioned themselves as improvisers who continually compensated for and adjusted to these instances.  These improvisations, however, still needed to be reconciled somehow with calls from above for orderly, or sometimes even scientific, practice.  The research found that this reconciliation process was not about deception.  Rather, aid workers often found that aid policy itself was written loosely enough to allow for flexible practice and for crucial backstage negotiations, vital for the successful transmission of aid, to occur without necessarily making it onto the written reports provided to aid donors.\n\nThis project, the researcher hopes, will shed important light on the links between humanitarian policy and practice, and provide a seldom-seen view of how frontline aid workers think about aid, and how they strive to reconcile directives from above with the extremely precarious working circumstances in which they find themselves.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen Hilgartner"
