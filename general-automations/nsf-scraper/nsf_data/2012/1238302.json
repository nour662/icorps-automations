The research efforts will be anchored by the University of Massachusetts Lowell as the lead institution, partnering with Texas A&M, the University of Texas at Dallas, and Iowa State University. \r\n\r\nWind energy systems for electricity production are complex engineered systems that operate on land or over water to produce usable power. These systems consist of an array of wind turbines placed on appropriate support structures and interconnected to deliver electric power to the utility grid. The potential for land-based and offshore wind energy is tremendous, but to achieve this potential will require a coherent and industry-relevant research and development program that involves industry, academe and government. The proposed I/UCRC will address industrially relevant research to advance and support the development of wind energy systems with low-cost energy and high reliability. The partners intend to engage in a cooperative program of research and education in the following areas: A) Composites in Wind Energy, B) Foundations and Towers, C) Manufacturing and Design, D) Structural Health Monitoring, Non-Destructive Inspection, and Testing,E) Control Systems and Storage, and F) Wind System Planning, Siting, Operations, and Maintenance. \r\n\r\nThe proposed center will provide a forum in which wind turbine manufacturers, manufacturers of key components, suppliers of ancillary equipment, service companies, and wind project developers can work together to solve problems that are of mutual interest. In addition, the center will work to develop and integrate educational activities that enhance recruitment and retention of diverse student populations. The Center intends to collaborate with KidWind, which provides teaching materials for K-12 teachers, and manages regional and national challenges for team turbine design competitions. The center will provide a conduit for the transfer of ideas among KidWind, industry, and academe and will engage industrial partners to develop regional training programs between educators and industry to create a sustainable pipeline of future STEM workers with strong interest by women and underrepresented groups.",

The potential for land-based and offshore wind energy is tremendous, but to achieve this potential will require a coherent and industry-relevant research and development program that involves industry, academe and government. The I/UCRC planning grant has addressed industrially relevant research to advance and support the development of wind energy systems with low-cost energy and high reliability. The partners intend to engage in a cooperative program of research and education in the following areas: A) Composites in Wind Energy, B) Foundations and Towers, C) Manufacturing and Design, D) Structural Health Monitoring, Non-Destructive Inspection, and Testing,E) Control Systems and Storage, and F) Wind System Planning, Siting, Operations, and Maintenance. \n \nThe goals of this planning grant were to bring together academic and industry partners to establish the structure of the WindSTAR Center, including the administrative, membership and advisory board, to discuss and establish research projects of mutual interest to industry, academic and government entities, and to ultimately submit a full proposal to establish WindSTAR as a Phase I NSF I/UCRC.  The project was successful.  The proposed WindSTAR Center accomplished the goal of hosting a successful planning meeting.  The Center Leadership, including the center director, site directors, faculty researchers, and staff, actively interacted with potential industry members before, during and after the planning meeting in the development of relevant research projects and to educate the industry representatives on the structure and benefits of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center.\n \n\nThe planning meeting was successfully hosted at the UMass Lowell Inn and Conference Center from May 29 to May 30, 2013 in Lowell, Massachusetts.  A total of 62 people attended the planning meeting.  There were representatives from 28 different companies, five universities and the National Science Foundation in attendance.  Another 30+ companies had expressed interest in attending, but were unable to attend.  All of the companies received information on the structure of I/UCRCs and information on the research that will be the focus of the WindSTAR Center.  In addition to the Planning Meeting, WindSTAR Center Leadership engaged in much of the groundwork for establishing a strong Center.  Center Leadership visited many companies to engage them in the process and to educate them on the benefits of joining a NSF I/UCRC.  The Center established a website, www.uml.edu/windstar to share information broadly about the purpose, capabilities, expertise and formation about the center.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mario A Rotea"
