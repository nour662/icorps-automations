 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the Bucknell University \"Summer Research Program in Physics and Astronomy\" will give 8 undergraduate students per summer the opportunity to collaborate with a member of the Bucknell faculty for 10 weeks on his or her research. Projects to be offered cover a broad range of topics, including experimental atomic and molecular physics, theoretical statistical mechanics, quantum information theory, theoretical quantum optics, computer simulation, experimental nonlinear dynamics, astronomy, and geophysics. This immersion in a research environment is intended to complement traditional classroom experiences of the students. Participation will help students make career choices, and will provide specific preparation for those that continue on to graduate studies in physics. Students will be recruited from around the country. All of the students will live together on the Bucknell campus, conduct most of their research in on-campus facilities, and participate in weekly departmental seminars and colloquia. Students will have the opportunity to present their work in regional and national conferences. Finally, it is anticipated that much of the work of the participants will be published in peer reviewed journals and these papers will include students as co-authors.  This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNational Science Foundation funding of the Bucknell REU Summer Research Program in Physics &amp; Astronomy provided ten-week research experiences for a total of 24 undergraduate students during the summers 2012-2015.  (These REU-funded students were part of a larger program with 21 other undergraduates supported with funds from individual investigator grants, the Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy, or Bucknell University.)  Students worked closely with a faculty mentor on his or her research, and because the Department does not have a graduate program, the participants had daily interaction with their mentors, and were able to take major roles in the research.\n\nThe research spanned a large number of areas within physics, astronomy, and closely related fields that depended on the expertise and interests of the faculty mentor(s), including projects in astrophysics, experimental nonlinear dynamics, computational biophysics, theoretical and compuational statistical mechanics, experimental nuclear physics, experimental atomic physics, theoretical quantum optics, solar energy, physics of atmospheric aerosols, and computational condensed matter physics.\n\nResearch with REU-supported students in our program has resulted in 6 published articles in peer-reviewed journals during the years 2012-2015, and students have been co-authors on 13 papers presented at professional scientific conferences, with the students presenting the work in all but one case.  (Additional publications are in preparation.)\n\nThe development of a cohort of students  with the potential to be productive members of the next generation of the STEM workforce was one of the principal goals of the Bucknell REU Summer Research Program in Physics &amp; Astronomy; this is something that has obvious potential to benefit society.  In the Bucknell program students were not simply taught the skills necessary for a single research project -- they also received training in a broad range of professional skills that extended beyond their research area.   This included programming on effective communication of scientific results (informal speaking, formal oral presentations, and poster presentations), programming on responsible conduct of research and scientific ethics, discussion of career paths and graduate schoool options, classes on general scientfic and computer skills that have applicability in a wide range of fields, and presentations by outside professionals on current research being done elsewhere.\n\nIn selecting students, the Bucknell REU Summer Research Program in Physics &amp; Astronomy was cognizant of the fact that the next generation of STEM workers needs representation from the full-breadth of society to reach its potential.  In addition to our national advertising through the NSF website of undergraduate research program, we targeted students from five regional community colleges who are participants in the Bucknell Community College Scholars Program.  This program is a partnership with five regional community colleges that  provides a path for transfer and a four-year degree for a select group  of low-income and first generation community college students.  Our  summer research program is not a part of the Community College Scholars  Program, but our regular and continuing institutional association with  community college faculty, students, and administrators, has helped us  identify promising young science students who might not otherwise be aware of research opportunities like those we can provide.  We invited five community college students to join our program during the years covered by this grant, and three participated with support from NSF.  (A fourth student was not eligible for NSF support, but participated with support from departmental funds, and a fifth student was not able to participate for personal reasons.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/07/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Martin K Ligare"
