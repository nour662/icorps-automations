 "awd_abstract_narration": "San Diego State University is using this planning grant award to explore the needs of returning Veterans in the San Diego region and identify effective strategies for engaging them in education and career pathways in the geosciences.  The San Diego region is host to several military bases and there is a large population of Veterans who have access to higher education through the G.I. Bill.  Data show that there is a greater proportion of Veterans, compared to the average student population, interested in pursuing degrees in STEM disciplines, making them a fertile opportunity for engagement in the geosciences.  In addition, Veterans are generally very diverse in ethnic and cultural background, as well as having a high proportion of persons with disabilities, as a result of their military service.  Unlike traditional students, Veterans often have completed some college level courses and have obtained valuable experiences as part of their service.  As such, their educational needs for completion of college degrees, or transitioning from college into graduate programs, involve a more customized pathway.  This planning grant will host two workshops for academic and military personnel to discuss and consider issues, barriers, and strategies for effectively engaging returning Veterans in the geosciences.  The project leverages an NSF-funded program at SDSU within the Engineering programs that specifically targets returning Veterans.  This project serves the NSF and GEO goal of broadening participation in STEM disciplines and addresses an important Presidential priority.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nVeterans and service persons need to be better informed about career opportunities in the geological sciences and other STEM disciplines.  In general there is a need for improved guidance for veterans.  This is crucial in order to ensure that the expanded post-9/11 GI bill resources are allocated toward best possible outcomes. Veterans making uninformed decisions are wasting their GI benefits on low value degrees.  Through the efforts of this grant we now recognize simple ways geological sciences at SDSU, and the broader university, can take a more active role in providing good information to veterans and service persons at SDSU and in the broader local community.\n\nFour-year institutions such as SDSU need to partner with Community Colleges in order to create unimpeded pathways to transfer into geological sciences as well as other STEM disciplines.  We have been actively working with local community colleges toward this.\n\nVeterans with limited GI bill resources and family obligations are often burdened financially as they work through school.  Providing summer internships for veterans is a possible solution and we have been actively involved in developing approaches to open more pathways to internship opportunities.\n\nLower division math, chemistry and physics requirements are a barrier to many veterans and active duty personnel in pursuing STEM degrees including geological sciences.  We are involved in developing ideas to help overcome this barrier including offering of basic pre-calculus mathematics courses that can help get veterans pointed in the right direction.\n\nLocal military bases provide advisement and counseling to assist active duty personnel with their education paths, but local universities need to play a more active role to support these efforts.  San Diego State University, for example, does not currently teach courses at Navy Base San Diego where many other schools, including many \"for-profit\" schools are in operation.  We are exploring the possibility of teaching courses at the base which will (1) provide active duty personnel with information about career opportunities in STEM disciplines, and (2) establish a solid link between these students and a reputable 4-year institution that can provide a valuable degree leading to successful careers.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/06/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David L Kimbrough"
