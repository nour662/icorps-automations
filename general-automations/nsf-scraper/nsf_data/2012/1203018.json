 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant is being used to develop the Helio-PROTEGEE (Physics Research Opportunity Toward Equality using a Grassroots Education Experience) program, which is a grassroots effort to engage talented students from diverse backgrounds in hands-on research experiences in heliophysics topics, and to mentor students in heliophysics so that they may be successfully placed in NSF-REU summer research programs. The program is motivated by daunting statistics. African-Americans are under-represented in physics at all levels, and it is estimated that African-Americans make up only about 1% of the approximately 1200 solar, geospace and heliospheric physicists in the United States. One difficulty of recruiting minority students to heliophysics is simple geography. Fifty-four percent of African-American's live in the Southeast region of the United States and 77% of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are in the Southeast. The vast majority of heliophysicists, however, live and work outside of this region. The heliophysics research groups at University of Alabama-Huntsville and the Marshall Space Flight Center are notable exceptions. These institutions are situated within a four-hour drive of 21 HBCUs, offering an ideal resource for engaging diverse students in hands-on geoscience activities, facilitating recruitment of under-represented students into the field.\r\n\r\nTwo key techniques that have been proven to successfully engage and retain African- American students in STEM disciplines are mentoring and inclusion in research programs. The ultimate goal of the Helio-PROTEGEE program is to expose a large number of under-represented students to research opportunities in heliophysics, to cultivate sustainable connections with faculty at the HBCU's, to develop mentor relationships with interested students, and to recruit students for existing and on-going heliophysics summer research programs, specifically NSF heliophysics research experience for undergraduate (REU) programs. The planning effort underway will define strategies for conducting meaningful outreach at 10 targeted universities in the southeastern US and engaging interested STEM majors in introductory heliophysics workshops. One goal of the planning effort is to develop mentoring relationships with a fraction of the students so as to help them find REU positions and provide them with additional background experiences in solar physics.",
