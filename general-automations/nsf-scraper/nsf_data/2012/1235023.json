 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will develop a general framework for defining risk measures for systems consisting of\r\na set of interacting agents with uncertain joint outcomes.  This framework will define convex\r\nprogramming-based axioms that characterize a very general class of systemic measures. This class\r\nof risk measures includes all the ad hoc risk measures that have been recently proposed in the\r\nliterature. The optimization-based approach leads to a primal-dual representation for the systemic\r\nrisk that allows attribution of the overall risk to individual agents in a fair manner, as well as\r\nthe development of decentralized algorithms for systemic risk sensitive social welfare\r\nmaximization. The project will seek to extend this representation to include a larger class of\r\nrisk functions. New structural models will aid the study of the role of contagion in complex\r\nsystems. A statistical methodology will be developed for identifying systemically important\r\nfactors and the exposure of the system to these factors. These systemic factors would lead to\r\nmethods for robust and efficient estimation of systemic risk.  Systemic risk measure based\r\nalgorithms for the design and control of the network structure underlying complex systems will\r\nalso be explored.\r\n\r\nRecent events across many disparate settings (e.g., the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in\r\n2010, the financial crisis in 2008, the Northeastern blackout in 2003) have all highlighted the\r\ncritical importance of risk management in general, and systemic risk management in\r\nparticular. Progress on tools for systemic risk management will help prevent, or at least better\r\nmanage, future systemic failures in financial, public health, environmental, national security,\r\nand governmental domains.  The proposed research is synergistic with ongoing relationships and\r\ncollaborations the PIs maintain with industry and policy-making groups concerned with systemic\r\nrisk in electricity grids and in capital markets. In addition, the project will provide funding\r\nfor research and educational opportunities for students.",
