 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding ocean variability over interannual and decadal time-scales is of widespread interest and increasing relevance given the concerns over anthropogenic perturbations of global climate and ocean chemistry due to increases in greenhouse gases.  The contributions of long-term observations to our understanding of how the ocean works are numerous and far-reaching. Yet, such studies are exceedingly rare- especially those with a biogeochemical and deep ocean focus. \r\n\r\nSince 1978, the Oceanic Flux Program (OFP), originally founded and managed by at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and  now managed by the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS),  has continuously measured particle fluxes in the deep Sargasso Sea. The 34+ year OFP time-series is, by far, the longest of its kind and unique in its focus on the deep ocean. OFP has produced a unique, albeit \"edited\", record of temporal variability in the \"biological pump\", a term loosely applied here to material transfer from the surface to the deep ocean. The OFP provided the first direct evidence for seasonality in the deep ocean and the tight coupling between deep fluxes and upper ocean processes. It has provided clear evidence of the intensity of biological reprocessing of flux and scavenging of suspended material in mesopelagic waters. The record has documented interannual and longer variations in deep fluxes and shorter term fluctuations driven by the interactions between mesoscale physical variability, meteorological forcing and ecosystem responses. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide three more years of funding for this unique and fundamental oceanographic time-series. As the record lengthens, we are better able to put into perspective the observed flux patterns in terms of the interplay between climate and ocean functioning. The colocation of complementary research programs at the Bermuda Time-Series Site: the OFP, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series (BATS), the Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM, 1994-2007), as well as new advances in ship-based, moored and autonomous observational capabilities at the site present unparalleled opportunities to study the coupled interactions among ocean physics, biology and chemistry and material fluxes, and how these in turn are linked to atmospheric and climatic forcing. New information about ocean biogeochemistry, preserved as chemical signals in recovered flux materials, continues to be revealed as ever more sophisticated analytical research tools are applied. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: (1) Systematic, long-term biogeochemical observations, such as those provided by the OFP, are essential to gain an understanding of natural oceanic variability and to provide a reference point in which to interpret the repercussions of possible future climate change scenarios. (2) Previous NSF review panels have recognized the OFP as an invaluable \"community resource\". The OFP will continue to share its resources- sample material, data, ancillary ship time, and use of the mooring platform- with researchers and students to make possible a diverse range of investigations at a very low cost to the community. (3) The OFP sample archive is a rare treasure. The sample material to be collected will continue to be invaluable for current and future biogeochemical and climate research. (4) Educational experiences provided by the OFP broaden the research experiences and science directions of many young students and early investigators at critical junctures in their careers. Of particular value are opportunities to become directly involved with observational oceanography, time-series research and integrated ship- and mooring-based research activities occurring at the Bermuda Time Series site",

Understanding the ocean&rsquo;s particle flux is important because it is a key process regulating many aspects of ocean biogeochemistry and global element cycles. For example, generation of large particles in surface waters, fueled by primary productivity, and the transfer of these particles to ocean depths via the sinking flux provides the food source that support most life in the ocean&rsquo;s interior and controls, in part, the ocean&rsquo;s ability to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide. The depth profile at which particles are degraded and dissolved, coined the \"length scale of remineralization\", affects how elements and nutrients are redistributed by ocean currents and, in turn, geographic patterns of productivity. New particle formation at depth by the feeding activities of deep-water biota and sorption of dissolved materials cleanses the ocean by aggregating small, suspended particles (e.g. continentally-sourced clays, pollutants, and authigenic minerals precipitated in-situ) and transferring them to the seafloor, to form the underlying sedimentary record.</p>\n<p>Over its nearly 40 year history, the OFP time-series has transformed our understanding of the oceanic particle flux and how the flux magnitude and composition varies in direct response to changes in the upper ocean environment and processes operating within the water column. OFP results provided the first direct observation of seasonality in the deep ocean, and evidence of the tight linkage between the surface and deep ocean environments via the particle flux. The synergy between the OFP and other Bermuda time-series programs has provided unprecedented new knowledge about the coupling between ocean physics, biology and chemistry and particle flux generation, composition and reprocessing within the ocean interior. Additionally, the OFP has been central in the development of numerous paleo-proxies that are used in reconstructions of past ocean history by studies of the ocean sedimentary record. The OFP time-series is now becoming long enough to reveal how the deep ocean environment is affected on longer time-scales by basin-scale climatic forcing such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and is ideally suited to provide valuable insights into how changing climate scenarios will affect the particle cycle and the deep ocean environment.</p>\n<p>During this grant cycle, we completed a decadal analysis of the detailed elemental composition of the particle flux, which expanded our knowledge of seasonality and upper ocean controls on elemental fluxes. With depth, the sinking flux becomes depleted in nutrient elements (P, Cd and Zn) due to organic matter remineralization and more enriched in lithogenic and authigenic elements due to suspended particle scavenging and oxide and hydroxide mineral formation. Flux elemental composition exhibits a clear signal of seasonal variations in the relative magnitude of inputs from overlying surface water production and from scavenging processes within the ocean interior. A related study of the carrier phases of the phosphorus flux found that as organic materials are degraded the importance of inorganic carrier phases increases, with a trend towards increasing importance of Mn-Fe (oxy)hydroxides and opal carriers in deeper waters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/16/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Maureen&nbsp;Conte</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1234294/1234294_10215618_1487282898354_5OFP3200mFlux_ForamOstracod--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1234294/1234294_10215618_1487282898354_5OFP3200mFlux_ForamOstracod--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"OFP 3200m flux foram and ostracod\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1234294/1234294_10215618_1487282898354_5OFP3200mFlux_ForamOstracod--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"OFP 3200m flux foram and ostracod\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Shells of a foraminifera (left) and ostracod (right) in the 3200m particle flux at the OFP time-series site in the northern Sargasso Sea.
