 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structure of many materials is determined by how the constituents of the material obey the many constraints that are established by microscopic physical principles.  For example, stable crystalline structures are those that are constrained to minimize the pairwise interactions between the atoms or molecules forming the crystal.  Similarly, in magnetic materials, the magnetic moments of electrons that are localized on neighboring atoms may lower their energy either by aligning in the same or in opposite orientations.  In some cases, there is no trivial way in which to satisfy all the energetic constraints within a system, and so the formation of any simple configuration of the system -- e.g. of magnetic moments within a crystalline structure -- is precluded.  This phenomenon is known as frustration.  The question of whether some sort of predictable order is established in frustrated systems, and, if so, what is the character of that order, are both major open questions in physics.  The answer to these questions has relevance to the design of new materials and the application of such materials to information technology and other uses.\r\n\r\nIn this project, the physics of frustrated materials will be explored using cold atoms that are trapped within geometric patterns -- such as the two-dimensional kagome lattice -- that lead to a high degree of frustration.  The effects of this frustration on phase transitions and on transport will be investigated.  The system chosen provides a clean realization of geometric frustration, free of the structural defects that influence solid-state realizations of similar systems.  Thus, the experimental findings may provide clear answers to vexing questions regarding geometric frustration.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn many fields of science, we struggle to understand how a large collection of objects obeying simple rules of interaction combine and organize to realize large scale emergent  structure and dynamics.  For example, in macroeconomics, we consider how individual economic actors together form the dynamical booms and busts of society-level economic activity.  In zoology, we consider how birds interact to form flocks and how these flocks respond to stimuli.  Similarly, in physics, we consider how a collection of many microscopic constituents, obeying well known quantum mechanics and interacting via well known laws of nature, combine to produce complex many-body systems.\n\nThe emergent properties of many-body quantum systems are of particular interest in the study of materials.  From a practical point of view, if we wish to design a material that has some optimal combination of properties, such as the ability to conduct heat or electricity efficiently, or to store information robustly in the form of reconfigurable magnetic structures, we need to understand better how the microscopic structure of a material, such as the geometric layout of ions within a solid-state crystal, influences the properties of the material at the macroscopic level.\n\nThis project has focused on understanding how the geometry of a crystal might lead to novel states of matter through the phenomenon of geometric frustration, which can be defined as a geometric arrangement of interacting objects that naturally produces an incompatible set of energy constraints that prevents better known and simpler states of matter from being realized.  We focused on a particular geometric pattern, the two-dimensional kagome lattice, which is known to exhibit strong geometric frustration in magnetic materials.  We created an experimentally accessible realization of many-body quantum physics in the kagome lattice, employing ultracold atoms as the itinerant objects which inhabit a kagome lattice that is projected upon them at the intersection of several coherent beams of light.\n\nThe first half of the granting period was used to establish the ability to create such a kagome geometry in which one could trap an ultracold atomic gas.  The method of producing the lattice allowed us to examine the interplay between changes in the geometric arrangement of a crystal lattice and its ability to conduct particle flow; specifically, we examined how a lattice-trapped gas could transition from being a perfect conductor to an insulator when the structure of the lattice was changed.\n\nThe second half of the granting period was used to improve the experimental setup.  This set of improvements was forced upon us by some technical failures.  In fixing these failures, we took advantage of the reconstruction of the experiment to improve the optical setup and enrich the experiment with another type of quantum gas -- potassium in addition to rubidium -- that will aid future research.\n\nThe grant also supported several theoretical works that point to novel possibilities for quantum matter that is trapped within two-dimensional triangular and kagome geometries.  We considered a paradigm-breaking type of insulator, a feature-less fractional-filling Mott insulating state, that could be realized by particles interacting with a fairly reasonable type of interaction within a kagome lattice.  We also discovered that ultracold molecules, if trapped within triangular or kagome lattices, could be used in a straight forward manner to simulate the physics of antiferromagnets with long range, isotropic spin interactions.  Based on intensive numerical studies, we reasoned that these dipolar antiferromagnets could realize a mysterious form of magnetic order, the elusive \"spin liquid\" magnetic state that supports unusual types of emergent excitations.\n\nThis work impacts the study of quantum magnetism which is a major part of condensed-matter and materials physics.  The work also impacts atomic physics, for example by the d..."
