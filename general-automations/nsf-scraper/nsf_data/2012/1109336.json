 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves an integrated program to study the process of tectonic escape in Central Anatolia. This is the location where this process was first recognized in the 1970s and the PIs make a strong case that this is good place to investigate the temporal and spatial characteristics of this process in the context of a continent-continent collision. \r\n\r\nThe research builds on previous geophysical and geological studies by many of the PIs in other parts of Turkey (both to the east and west of the planned study area). The  research will investigate modern structure through a combination of geophysics and geology. Past history will be reconstructed through studies of elevation, drainage and volcanism. Studies of the Central Anatolian fault are important as this is a major feature that is poorly understood in Anatolian tectonics.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the PIs will address the questions:\r\n\r\n?\tWhat are the plate dynamics from the mantle to the Earth?s surface, the transition from distributed to localized strain in large strike-slip faults, the origin and consequences of magmatism, and the evolution of relief and landscape during development of escape tectonics?\r\n?\tWhat are the effects of boundary conditions (collision of Arabian plate to the east, extension of Aegean to the west, subduction of African plate to the south) on the driving forces of tectonic escape?\r\n\r\nThe study will integrate results of passive seismic experiments; magnetotelluric profiling; geomorphic, structural, and stratigraphic-sedimentological analysis of surface geology and exhumed orogenic crust; geo/thermochronometric determination of temperature-time histories of magmatic, metamorphic, and fault zone rocks and geomorphic features; isotopic fingerprinting and dating of magmatic rocks; and 2D and 3D numerical modeling.",

Where these plates converge one finds either subduction zones (where denser oceanic lithosphere slides below the upper plate and sinks into the asthenosphere - a less rigid layer below the lithosphere) or collision zones (where buoyant continental lithosphere of the subducting plate resists subduction, and deforms forming mountains). The CD-CAT project focuses on understanding the transition from ocean-continent subduction to continent-continent collision and addressing how the asthenosphere, lithosphere, and Earth's surface evolve during this transition in the Central Anatolia region of Turkey. Before ~40 million years ago, the entire southern boundary of the Anatolian plate was an ocean-continent subduction zone. Then ~40 to 20 million years ago, Arabian plate continental lithosphere began to collide with eastern Anatolia, resulting in mountain building and formation of the high-elevation Anatolian plateau. In contrast, to the west, oceanic subduction continued south of western Turkey and the Aegean Sea. In space, this transition is marked by the major Central Anatolian strike-slip fault (CAF) (a lithosphere tear where two blocks slide horizontally past one another) and in time, by a change from widely-distributed mountain building in eastern Anatolia, to localized lithosphere deformation along the North and East Anatolian strike-slip faults resulting in the westward movement (\"escape tectonics\") of the Anatolian plate away from the collision zone.</p>\n<p>The University of Arizona (UA) contributed two major components to the CD-CAT project:</p>\n<p>(1)&nbsp;<strong>Seismology&nbsp;</strong>(the study of earthquake-generated seismic waves that travel through the Earth to image the subsurface): We collected seismic data continually at 71 seismic stations for 2 years to image the subsurface down to a depth of 900 km. Our seismic images reveal that the mantle lithosphere of central Anatolia is thin due to decoupling of the crust of the accreted blocks. The decoupled material continued to subduct until about 15 million years ago. Beneath the Central Anatolian Volcanic Province (CAVP), the upper most mantle is characterized by very slow shear velocities consistent with the presence of melt and hence, provide a source for the CAVP.&nbsp;The fastest shear velocities observed in central Anatolia underlie the Central Taurus Mountains, which have experienced ~2 km of uplift in the past ~8 million years. These velocities are consistent with lithospheric mantle, and we interpret that the recent uplift of these mountains is due to a rebound of the subducting slab after slab break-off and/or fragmentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also imaged the subducting lithospheric slabs between the African and Arabian plates, and the Anatolian plate that indicate subduction is in the process of terminating through progressive slab tearing and slab break-off.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subduction termination and break-off may be an important process in the transition to escape tectonics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our findings on the destructive process of subduction termination and slab detachment have significant implications for our understanding of the post-detachment behavior of subducted lithosphere.</p>\n<p>(2)&nbsp;<strong>Geochronology and thermochronology&nbsp;</strong>(dating of rocks and reconstructing their temperature history through time by measuring naturally-occurring radioactive isotopes and the products of their radioactive decay): We dated 157 rock samples collected from central Turkey applying 3 different techniques (uranium-lead, uranium-thorium-helium, and fission-track dating) to acquire 260 sample ages. Our most significant findings are (1) new dates of deposition of previously un-dated deformed sedimentary rock that provide a maximum 34 to 40 million year old age for onset of deformation linked to collision of Arabian plate continental lithosphere with Anatolia; (2) This timing is supported by new thermochronology data that record cooling of rocks linked to erosion of new mountains formed at this time; (3) New thermochronologic results integrated with field-based observation show the southern CAF is an important tectonic boundary that underwent at least two phases of movement: one between 45 and 25 million years ago related to onset of collision east of the CAF, and another between 25 and 15 million year ago, that likely reflects early transition from collisional to escape tectonics across Anatolia; and (4) a newly discovered phase of erosion around 25 to 15&nbsp;&nbsp;million years ago west of the CAF related to extension (stretching of the upper lithosphere) driven by continued oceanic subduction at this time below western Anatolia.</p>\n<p>Broader impacts include training and mentoring of 1 masters, and 4 PhD students, and 1 postdoc, in acquisition and interpretation of seismologic, geochronologic, and thermochronologic data. The project fostered international collaboration with scientists from Turkey, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. We acquired substantial new geophysical and other data relevant to understanding seismic and volcanic hazards within the Anatolian plate. As of February 2019, UA researchers have published 7 peer reviewed papers in international high-impact scientific journals, with at least 5 more in preparation for submission, and have communicated their work in 20 presentations at international conferences.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/16/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stuart&nbsp;N&nbsp;Thomson</p>\n</div>\n<div
