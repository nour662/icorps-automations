 "awd_abstract_narration": "When dealing with massive quantities of data, ranking and aggregate\r\nqueries are powerful techniques for focusing attention on the most\r\nimportant answers. Many applications that produce such massive\r\nquantities of data inherently introduce uncertainty in the same time,\r\nfor example, probabilistic match in data integration, imprecise\r\nmeasurements from sensors, fuzzy duplicates in data cleaning,\r\ninconsistency in scientific data. Hence, the importance of these\r\nqueries is even greater in probabilistic data, where a relation can\r\nencode exponentially many possible worlds. Uncertainty opens the gate\r\nto many possible definitions for ranking and aggregate queries. This\r\nproject systematically examines the underlying properties associated\r\nwith the rich semantics of ranking and aggregate queries for large\r\namounts of probabilistic data. More importantly, this project\r\ninvestigates the issue of how to design novel and scalable algorithms\r\nfor processing these queries efficiently in various settings, such as\r\nthe offline, centralized environment, distributed systems and the\r\nstreaming model.\r\n\r\nWith the emergence of probabilistic data in many important application\r\ndomains, the demand for understanding and processing the ranking and\r\naggregate queries efficiently from the scientific community and beyond\r\n(e.g., government and military agencies) is expected to intensify in\r\nthe coming years. The results of this project lay down a firm\r\nfoundation for this important problem. \r\n\r\nFor further information, such as publications, data sets and source code, \r\nplease see the project website at http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~lifeifei/rankaggprob\r\n",
