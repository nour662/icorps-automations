 "awd_abstract_narration": "The influence of organized regions of deep convection on its environment in both space and time has been recognized for many years.  For example, organized deep convective regions are known to enhance upper-level jet streaks through modification of the direct mass circulation in jet entrance regions through diabatic heating.  Individual thunderstorms modify the nearby surrounding mass and momentum fields within a few hours, likely assisting in storm maintenance and influencing storm severity.  While past observational and modeling studies have documented these nearby and more distant feedback effects, this research represents the first attempt to conduct a careful comparison of model-simulated convective feedbacks with those diagnosed from dropsonde and Microwave Temperature Profiling (MTP) observations taken during the Mesoscale Predictability Experiment (MPEX).  The improved capability of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models at convection-allowing grid spacing (1-4 km), and the availability of the NCAR GV airborne observing systems, argues strongly that it is time to understand how deep convection modifies the surrounding environment in much greater detail.\r\n\r\nA multi-institutional team with broad expertise has been assembled to pursue the fundamental scientific questions of convective storm-environmental feedbacks and predictability.  In particular, the team will seek to: 1) quantify the observed environmental modifications and upscale feedbacks from deep convection, and relate these back to the characteristics of the convection; 2) evaluate model simulations of upscale feedbacks from deep convection with MPEX observations; and 3) explore the predictability of convectively disturbed atmospheres.  These objectives will be met using various diagnostic approaches applied to the dropsonde observations, including calculation of heat and moisture budgets; numerical model simulations with ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation at convection-allowing resolutions; and careful comparisons between MPEX observations and model simulations.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: \r\nResults from this project will lead to a much better understanding of the convective storm-environmental feedback.  Upscale feedbacks from deep convection will be documented carefully for the first time with the unique MPEX observations that will surround the convective region.  Model analyses, constrained via the ensemble Kalman filter approach, will allow for a novel assessment of the capability of a convection-allowing model simulation to reproduce these upscale feedbacks.  Improved understanding of the predictability of convectively disturbed atmospheres will provide new insight into the rapid decrease of forecast skill in research and operational numerical weather prediction models of high-impact convective weather events.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nResults from this project will yield new information on the observations needed within and nearby convective regions to extend the predictability of numerical model forecasts of hazardous weather events.  It will also provide insight on how well upscale feedbacks are represented in current model parameterizations of deep moist convection, and how this might affect predictions on seasonal and longer time scales.  Research results will be integrated into teaching materials and published to reach broad audiences.  Three graduate students will be trained through participation in MPEX data collection, research and teaching activities, and participation at conference and workshops.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the entire life of this award there were numerous findings related to our ability to improve the prediction of thunderstorms and to understanding how thunderstorms modify the atmosphere.  The impact of targeted balloon-borne measurements of the atmosphere on numerical model analyses and forecasts of thunderstorms was quantified over numerous events --a first for the meteorological community.  It was found that judiciously chosen locations and times for releasing weather balloon observations a few hours prior to thunderstorm development, and assimilation of those observations into numerical models, can have significant positive impacts on the model forecasts of the subsequent thunderstorms. These results are helping to guide further research on how best to improve our capability to observe the atmosphere as the weather community seeks to improve our weather prediction capabilities (a broad impact to NOAA's task of saving lives and protecting property through hazardous weather prediction).  Furthermore, it was found that current numerical models cannot faithfully depict the near-storm increase in wind speeds induced by thunderstorms themselves, particularly for intense thunderstorms known as supercells.  It was also found that these models tend to under predict the coldness and depth of the rain-cooled air within these thunderstorms. These results add to the important body of knowledge on the deficiencies of current numerical models and will help guide future improvements to them.\n\nUsing strategically released weather balloon observations surrounding thunderstorms, research on how thunderstorms modify their environments resulted in several findings.  First, it was found that the atmosphere around supercells is modified substantially.  However, in the wake of supercells, while the rain-cooled air near the ground can persist for a few hours as the storms move away, storm-induced modifications in the lower to middle atmosphere exit quickly with the storm.  This was not an expected result and could have implications for how forecasters apply knowledge of the environment in their predictions of convective weather.  Second, with supplemental support provided by NSSL-internal funding, weather balloon observations in the inflow of supercells found that tornadic supercells tend to greatly enhance the wind speeds flowing into the storm as far as 25 km away, but non-tornadic supercells do not.  This result is contrary to what was found in past studies of supercell inflow modifications using weather balloon observations taken within the NSF-funded VORTEX2 project (a comprehensive field program to study tornadoes and supercell thunderstorms that took place in 2009-2010).  The data related to the current award represents the environment closer to the storms, so this finding could have identified the spatial extent around storms that tornadic circulations can modify their environments.  This work also identified some subtle but perhaps important differences in the environments between tornadic and non-tornadic supercells, including 1) near-ground temperatures that remain warmer into the near-storm environment for tornadic supercells compared to non-tornadic supercells and 2) higher humidity well-above the ground in the non-storm-modified air flowing into tornadic supercells.  Equally interesting was the lack of any significant differences in the characteristics of the wind shear profile near the ground between tornadic and non-tornadic supercells, which was an unexpected finding.  These results will add to the growing direct observational evidence of the differences (and similarities) between tornadic and non-tornadic environments, which will eventually lead to greater understanding of how thunderstorms produce tornadoes and an improved ability to anticipate them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Coniglio"
