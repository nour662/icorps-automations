 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research project (IIS-1160894, W. Bruce Croft, University of Massachusetts Amherst and IIS-1160862, Jamie Callan, Carnegie-Mellon University) addresses the complex issues of ephemeral information that is generated as part of social interactions is different in terms of time scale, quantity, and quality to archival information found on the web. This project investigates the hypothesis that, because of the context provided, searching either ephemeral or archival information is enhanced using the connections between them. It  develops new retrieval models and features for ranking functions in a range of search tasks that can exploit an integrated ephemeral/archival network. Some search tasks are based on previous TREC blog, microblog, and web activities. It also investigates two new tasks, conversation retrieval and aggregated social search.  Conversation retrieval targets information units in the form of \"conversations\" or \"events\" instead of simply retrieving social postings or web pages. Aggregated social search ranks information in different granularities, such as sentence, posting, conversation, or thread, based on the underlying query intent. \r\n\r\nResearch that explores the connections between ephemeral and archival information requires a dataset that contains both types of information.  A crucial part of this project extends the archival ClueWeb12 dataset with ephemeral microblog, blog, and discussion forum data that links to the web data.  This extension is distributed to the research community as the ClueWeb12++ dataset. This project (http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/research/ephemeral/) is the first to address the full possibilities of search that exploits all the connections and contexts created by bringing together the two \"worlds\" of information.  It also develops and distributes a unique new dataset that supports the development of a new generation of tools to access a broad range of information. Students at collaborating institutions, University of Massachusetts Amherst and Carnegie-Mellon University will be involved in educational activities and benefit from research experience.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigated the hypothesis that analyzing and searching either ephemeral or archival information can be enhanced using the connections between them by developing more effective retrieval models that use both types of information for a diverse set of search and text analysis tasks.  The project also developed new methods of creating links between ephemeral and archival resources, new methods of acquiring ephemeral information efficiently from social media websites, and new reusable datasets for several problems.  These resources enable other researchers to reproduce our research results and do their own research on these problems more easily.  Parts of this research were done in collaboration with the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) in Australia and the Universidade Nova de Lisboa in Portugal.\n\nMuch of the research focused on improving the accuracy of search engines for several tasks.  When social media discussion links to a web page, the discussion provides concise and accurate descriptions of the web page; these descriptions can be used to improve the accuracy of a search engine.  Tuning text summarization algorithms to mimic discussion in social media sites improves the quality of summaries produced for answer passage retrieval.  These improvements are especially important for finding answers to questions that have complex answers instead of simple ?factoid? answers.  Improved learning-to-rank algorithms and data fusion algorithms further improve retrieval accuracy. We have also studied the impact of combining social and archival data in the environment of conversational search, which has become increasingly important during the project.\n \nMicroblog sites such as Twitter are difficult to search effectively, because messages are brief and spelling varies.  This research showed that archival sources such as news websites can be used to identify the temporal scope of a query and to provide greater context for the query, which improves search accuracy and efficiency.  Often microblog posts can be organized into threads or conversations &ndash; sequences of microblog posts &ndash; which are a more effective unit of information for retrieval, topic classification, and sentiment analysis tasks.\n\nSocial media such as microblogs (e.g., Twitter) and community question answering sites (e.g., Yahoo! Answers) are important sources of ephemeral information.  The project developed new methods of crawling social media websites more efficiently, and showed that a 1% sample of Twitter supports the same conclusions as more complete samples for some tasks.  The text collections developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technologies? annual TREC evaluations are the most widely-studied archival datasets.  The project enriched existing TREC datasets by adding relevance annotations that support study of the connections between answers in social media and answer passages in web documents; and by adding links from the mention of an entity in document text to its entry in the Freebase knowledge base.  It also developed new methods of automatically creating datasets for research on question-answering.\n\nOur work in all of these areas has been ground-breaking and has had significant impact on both academia and industry. We have shown the value of integrating ephemeral and archival information to improve several types of search and text analysis.
