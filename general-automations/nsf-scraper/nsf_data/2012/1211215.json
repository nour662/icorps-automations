 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is part of a collaborative project with three universities to conduct a detailed study of circumstellar gas around rapidly rotating A-type dwarf stars. An A-type main-sequence star is burning hydrogen and ais distinguished by having spectra showing strong hydrogen absoprtion lines.  Some of these A type stars also have low metal abundances in their surface layers and are sometimes referred to as \"Lambda Boo\" stars, after lambda Bootis, the first one to show these features.  This project will focus on observing the gas emission in order to constrain models of accretion from disk to the star and to better understand planetary formation and evolution models.  \r\n\r\nThis project will have broader impacts of contributing to knowledge of stellar and planetary system evolution.  These institutions will also add a significant undergraduate educational component, involving students in the data acquisition, reduction, analysis, and publication of results.",

To do that, we would need to employ both archival data (including data from the GALEX, WISE, and Spitzer space telescopes), and new observations to assess the prevalence of dust and gas in the circumstellar environments of these stars.\n\nFor the first goal we reviewed the extensive literature on the Lambda Boo stars, and identified 212 stars that had been classified as Lambda Boo stars in the past.  We then devised new and improved criteria, involving both ultraviolet and visible spectra that would enable us to positively identify a star as a Lambda Boo star.  Using a uniform set of criteria, we then examined those 212 candidates and were able to identify 64 bona fide Lambda Boo stars.  As it turns out, a number of those stars are young protostars which are clearly in the stage of planet formation.\n\nThe second goal -- to discover many more Lambda Boo stars -- is still ongoing.
