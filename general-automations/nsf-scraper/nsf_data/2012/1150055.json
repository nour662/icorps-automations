 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algorithms used in computational mathematics are increasingly\r\nsophisticated and complex; and the modern civilization critically\r\ndependents on scientific software at all levels from design to\r\nequipment control.  Yet, the programming languages and tools used to\r\nexpress algorithms as computer programs do not progress at a matching\r\npace, leaving an expanding gap between provably correct published\r\nalgorithms and their realizations in code.  Failures in software\r\nsystems can cost human lives and are responsible for billions of\r\ndollars lost annually.  Furthermore, silent failures of simulation\r\nsoftware can seriously undermine the credibility of a scientific\r\nmodel, entailing profound intellectual liabilities.  This research\r\nproject will investigate formal-methods-based principles and tools to\r\nmake the practice of programming a more mathematical activity for\r\nordinary programmers. The overriding aim is to make dependability a\r\ncommon basic property of critical software. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo that end, the PI will design a new programming system that supports\r\nresearch in axiomatic programming based on new logical linguistic\r\nconstructs, invent new programming models and tools grounded in formal\r\nreasoning and methods.  The PI will investigate the design of practical\r\ndependent type systems for mathematics software and their efficient\r\ncompilation to support integrated automated deduction and computer\r\nalgebra systems.  The project has synergistic components that build\r\nbridges between symbolic and algebraic computation, compiler construction,\r\nproof theory, and education.  Insights gained from this project will\r\nbe integrated into new courses, supported by a book on the practical\r\nimplementation of modern type systems and compilers.  The PI expects\r\nto discover basic principles of axiomatic programming, tools, and\r\ntechniques.  The results  are expected to influence the evolution of\r\nexisting  major mainstream programming languages (such as C++) in\r\ntheir support for structured generic programming and improvement of \r\nsoftware reliability.  As ever, the PI will involve students both at\r\nthe undergraduate and graduate levels, in hands-on, fully integrated\r\nresearch-based classes.",
