 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science educators are constantly reinventing introductory courses to revitalize the overall curriculum, without the requisite attention to the fundamental upper-level courses. While the focus on drawing students into Computer Science is vital to maintain the enrollment needed to supply a technically-starved workforce, it is vital to use innovative pedagogical approaches, contextualized to how students learn, throughout the curriculum ensuring that students attain the technical skills needed to succeed in industry. To address these challenges, this project has two main thrusts. First, it designs, pilots and evaluates curriculum materials for three upper-level Computer Science courses that utilize mobile computing technology to contextualize, motivate and demonstrate fundamental computing concepts on a platform students can relate to. The three courses utilize active learning pedagogical approaches that engage and encourage students to attain core computing principles while attaining the marketable technical skills associated with mobile technology. Second, it creates service-learning opportunities, out-of-classroom events and internship positions in which students can apply the mobile technology skills in an industry project and showcase their work to the larger community. The culmination of these efforts creates a synergy between instruction in and out of the classroom that balances the acquisition of fundamental computing skills and the attainment of in-demand industry technical skills.",

The exposure to cutting-edge technologies in a capstone project course as well as in core, computer science courses will continue to contextualize important computing concepts to technologies familiar to today\u00c6s students. Societal benefits include an evaluated and improved educational approach spanning several courses that will be used to train students to imagine, design and develop the mobile applications of the future and enable a more prepared workforce. The SMART@TU Mobile Application Development Lab at Towson University will continue to provide service-learning opportunities for students and technology transfer for community partners without the technical resources.
