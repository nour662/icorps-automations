For this project, we were studying a set of closely related roundworms (nematodes), whose populations, like those of many parasitic forms, include not only males and female but also self-fertile forms (hermaphrodites) that produce both sperm and oocytes. Within these populations, the development of hermaphrodites but not males or females is linked in an obligatory way to passage through a distinct larval stage (dauer) than is equivalent to the infective larvae of parasitic forms. Intriguingly, our chosen species, also like many parasitic forms, exhibits skewed gender ratios that can?t be explained by standard Mendelian genetics; but unlike parasitic forms, our species eat bacteria and are easy to rear under standard laboratory conditions. This proposal sought to uncover the mechanisms by which a particular nematodes (Rhabditis sp. SB347, now called Auanema rhodensis) and its near relatives regulate the ratio of males, females, and hermaphrodites amongst their offspring.\n\nHow does A. rhodensis achieve its ratio of male, females, and hermaphrodites?\n\n1)      If females and hermaphrodites are both genetically XX, how is this decision developmentally determined? Females and hermaphrodites were known to be born with different sized gonads, but in this study, we identified molecular compounds (pheromones) that could convert female-fated larvae to develop as hermaphrodites or could be inhibited and convert hermaphrodite-fated larvae to develop as females.  \n\n2)      At a population level, how is the species propagated?

Our analysis of how the structural (cytoskeletal) elements reorganize during sperm development in a variety of nematode species revealed unappreciated similarities to processes in both dividing and differentiating cells. In A. rhodensis, sperm production employs standard cellular mechanisms, but in the tiny spermatocytes, a bipolar process that normally generates two sperm and a cellular waste bag called a residual body, becomes unipolar, generating one sperm and a residual body containing the other complement of genetic material.\n\n4)      How do A. rhodensis hermaphrodites achieve self-fertility? In an unexpected finding, we discovered that A. rhodensis hermaphrodites produce sperm in a fundamentally different way than the well-studied model nematode Caenorhabiditis elegans.

We also discovered that one reason they can do this is that their sperm production involves a population of dividing cells that are intermediates between germline stem cells and spermatocytes (the cells that will directly divide to form sperm).
