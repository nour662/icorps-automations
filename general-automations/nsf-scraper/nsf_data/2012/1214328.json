 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University proposes to support technical services on R/V Marcus Langseth as part of the U.S. Academic Fleet which is scheduled by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).   R/V Langseth, a 235? seismic survey vessel purchased in 2005 from Western GECO to be operated as a geophysical research vessel (with some additional general purpose oceanographic capabilities) is owned by the National Science Foundation and replaced R/V Maurice Ewing, a 236? research vessel operated by LDEO from 1990 to 2005.\r\n\r\nLDEO is requesting funds to support both basic and specialized services for multichannel seismic data acquisition.  They propose to provide at least three technicians on each seagoing research project to provide basic services and to maintain equipment calibrate sensors and provide support for qualified users.  Specialized services include both single cable and multiple cable seismic operations. LDEO proposes to sail eight technicians for single cable mode and 12 technicians for multi-cable mode. The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

This ship is a 235-foot global class research vessel that is a specialized facilty within the U.S. Academic Research Fleet and &nbsp;provides substantial capability for seismic imaging of the subseafloor of the worlds oceans. The ship also has the capability to continuously collect other complimentary data sets like gravity, magnetics, wide swath bathymetric seafloor mapping, current profiling, and dissolved carbon dioxide in sea surface waters.

By using a single streamer, we can create 2-dimensional acoustic images. &nbsp;With 4 streamers (6km each), we can develop a full 3D image of the target area. &nbsp;The depth under the seafloor that we are able to image varies by project goal but can range from a just a few km to as much as 60-70km. &nbsp;Targets of interest for these projects range widely but include study of mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones, earthquake and other geohazard prone areas, origins of hot spots, hydrothermal fields, plate behavior, continental margins, fluids and hydrogeology of ocean crust and more.</p>\n<p>Over the period of this award from 2012 through 2017, 24 major projects were accomplished throughout the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. 18 of these were for 2D or 3D seismic imaging using &nbsp;reflection with Multi-Channel Seismic or seismic refraction experiments using Ocean Bottom Seismometers or a combination of both. &nbsp;The other six projects included supporitng sediment coring , ROV deployment, electromagnetic imaging, multibeam mapping, to chemical/biological oceanography. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Technical Services award also provides for the environmental compliance and permitting/authorizations both nationally and internationally for our projects.
