 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Justine Rebecca Garcia of Emory University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Disentangling the effect of multiple symbionts on host development and survival,\" during the summer of 2012 at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Sapporo.  The host scientist is Dr. Yoshitomo Kikuchi.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is a more complete investigation of the effect of bacteria on host phenotype. Bacteria can have a significant impact on host health, reproduction, and survival, but most studies have focused on the effect of one bacterial species at a time though most animals are colonized with many, possibly interacting bacterial species. Here a natural model is being used to assess the impact of multiple, naturally occurring bacteria on the development, survival, and reproduction of insect hosts. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
