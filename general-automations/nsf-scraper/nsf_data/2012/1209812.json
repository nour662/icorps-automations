 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Brian Steidinger of Indiana University Bloomington to conduct a research project, entitled \"Investigating novel defenses of New Zealand conifers towards exploitative fungi,\" during the summer of 2012 at Landcare Research in Lincoln, Christchurch.  The host scientist is Ian Dickie.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to uncover unique adaptations of Southern hemisphere conifers (Podocarpaceae) that may allow them to segregate and sanction exploitative fungal partners upon whom they rely for soil nutrients.  Field studies are being conducted in collaboration with scientists in New Zealand who collaborate with Maori Iwis (self-governing communities) who collect samples on protected land.  This research explores the efficacy of plant defenses against exploitative fungi in natural conditions - investigations that complement ongoing laboratory work on the same subject. In addition to studying the ecology and physiology of plant defenses, this project provides a learning experience for the Fellow on the economic and cultural value of NZ conifers, which are used for timber and steeped in native mythology.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
