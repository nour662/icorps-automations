 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing the Building Efficiency for a Sustainable Tomorrow (BEST) National Center to support improvements in the field of building systems technician education. With the large scale transformation underway in the building industry, building systems technicians must be educated and prepared to manage the increasingly complex building automation and energy management systems now being installed or under development. \r\n\r\nThe Center is: 1) creating a national network of industry advisors and research laboratories tasked with helping to define emerging industry skill requirements, validate model courses and curricula, and advocate for the mission of the Center to the larger community of industry stakeholders, 2) advancing the knowledge base of community college educators by providing opportunities and resources in the following priority areas: curriculum development, professional development, career pathway development, and dissemination of research, and 3) strengthening the national STEM pathway for educating building technicians and engineers starting in high school.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Educators are advancing their knowledge and understanding of this multi-disciplinary field through professional development workshops that present best practices in building system technician education. Students are benefiting from enhanced industry-validated curricula and well-honed instructional strategies, as well as expanded program offerings and hands-on labs. The Center is creating links to research from national laboratories and research institutions on its website to inform curricular improvements. The project is leveraging the work of other centers funded by the National Science Foundation, as well as Department of Energy-funded research and development activities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The Center responds directly to research conducted by the Building Intelligence Group that identified broad workforce trends and gaps in training for building system technicians. The Center is providing professional development and resources to improve classroom instruction and learning, as well as disseminating information on research and new technologies developed by national laboratories.",

Complementary to HPBOP certification, development of BAS-related credentials and continuing education will strengthen the support of today&rsquo;s &ldquo;intelligent buildings.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Impact on students and the workforce</span> - From 2014-17, more than 3,400 students took at least one course informed by BEST resources, and over 1,400 completed BEST-impacted programs.

Employer feedback reveals that companies recruit employees from BEST colleges because the graduates are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More knowledgeable about mechanical and electrical systems and can rapidly learn new methods and technologies;</li>\n<li>Better prepared due to hands-on skills development;</li>\n<li>Quality employees who transition into the workforce well and can grow quickly within an organization;</li>\n<li>Able to understand the values of energy conservation and environmental stewardship.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The mission continues</span> - In May 2017, BEST was awarded a 5-year renewal grant of $3.6 million from the National Science Foundation.

The goals are to:\n\nDevelop a national HPBOP certification and exam.\nCreate a 2-year Associate of Science degree curriculum aligned with the certification.\nDesign and implement a condensed pilot program for educating incumbent technicians.\n\n\nFor the last goal, BEST has worked with investor-owned utilities and other stakeholders on a plan to enhance the skills of incumbents in California. The successful completion of this pilot program in 2017 has reinforced the urgency of developing the certification and stimulated further interest among businesses and organizations to upskill the workforce.\n\n BEST is also partnering with Association of Controls Professionals, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to create a community of practice for BAS controls technicians, educators, and related professionals. Complementary to HPBOP certification, development of BAS-related credentials and continuing education will strengthen the support of today?s \"intelligent buildings.\"\n\nImpact on students and the workforce - From 2014-17, more than 3,400 students took at least one course informed by BEST resources, and over 1,400 completed BEST-impacted programs. Nearly 1,500 were placed into the workforce, and it is expected that the number of reported workforce entries will rise as more colleges join the Center?s network.\n\nCorporate support and investment in college programs--both locally and nationally--illustrate the value that industry places on these programs. Employer feedback reveals that companies recruit employees from BEST colleges because the graduates are:\n\nMore knowledgeable about mechanical and electrical systems and can rapidly learn new methods and technologies;\nBetter prepared due to hands-on skills development;\nQuality employees who transition into the workforce well and can grow quickly within an organization;\nAble to understand the values of energy conservation and environmental stewardship.\n\n\nThe mission continues - In May 2017, BEST was awarded a 5-year renewal grant of $3.6 million from the National Science Foundation. This will allow the Center to extend its pioneering work with college educators and assist the high performance buildings and technicians so essential to the future of the nation and our planet.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter L Crabtree"
