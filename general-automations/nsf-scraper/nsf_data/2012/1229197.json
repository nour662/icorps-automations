 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's request funding to acquire a state-of-the-art, high-resolution, hybrid mass spectrometry system and associated peripherals (LC-MSn). The proposed instrumentation represents a strategic expansion of ODU research capabilities in marine ecosystem studies and will provide new critical research tools for a team of faculty, researchers and students. The LC-MSn instrumentation will be used for structural characterization and quantitative analysis of a diverse suite of polar molecules, most of which are biotic in origin and represent living materials and metabolites, including those of emerging environmental and ecological health concerns. A range of interdisciplinary research activities will benefit from the proposed instrumentation, include: elucidating biogeochemical cycling of organic matter in the Arctic Ocean by analysis of molecular organic markers; utilizing environmental proteomics to understand marine nitrogen cycling and geochemical processes; analyzing transformations of organic nitrogen in coastal systems; characterizing organic molecules associated with marine protists; and addressing the roles of dissolved organic ligands in the sorption and bioavailability of trace metals. This new instrumentation will facilitate further development of ongoing and future research projects that require new levels of analytical sophistication for characterization of organic compounds present in marine and estuarine ecosystems and their environmental context. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe requested instrumentation will help the continued development of infrastructure for research. Graduate students as well as undergraduate students will benefit from this state-of-the-art facility. ODU has an outreach program through the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center which provides excellent opportunities for public outreach. The research derived from the use of the instrument is to be highlighted through the aquarium and public lectures.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award made through the major research instrumentation (MRI) program at the national science foundation supported the purchase of a new instrument for geosciences research and training at Old Dominion University.  The tandem mass spectrometer is the next generation of instruments capable of measuring the mass of a specific molecular very accurately, which allows its chemical structure to be reconstructed with high precision.  In the past, the complex mixtures present in environmental samples were both challenging and difficult, as the complex mixtures present in the real world required extensive purification before analysis.  These new instruments provide both the accurate mass needed for structural determination as well as he associated detectors and computational power needed to rapidly scan and record the masses of a diverse mixture of materials present.  This advance allows a much more detailed picture of the complex mixture and thus the pathways which are operating in the ocean systems to be better defined.   While the specific research questions being addressed are diverse, the larger goal for this instrument has been to develop capabilities for an integrative research program focusing on organic materials, and their characterization in systems ranging from the nearby coastal systems of the Chesapeake Bay to the polar oceans.  There has also been the focus on student training with a number of graduate students and undergraduates given the opportunity to develop the skill sets needed for operation and data analysis.  Over the three year program period we established this instrument as a workhorse for research projects and have also expanded the scope of materials being analyzed to community partners to develop approaches for chemical analysis which can benefit others.  Multiple graduate student research projects have benefited directly and scientific progress has been shown through both the scientific literature and several graduate degrees.  Additional exposure has included important groups of undergraduates.   This investment in the analytical instruments which are critical to the scientific enterprise has yielded both benefits to the skills training for our next generation of scientists and allowed a deeper understanding of the processes that are active in our oceans.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: H.
