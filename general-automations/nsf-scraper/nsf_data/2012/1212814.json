The R/V Atlantic Explorer is a general-purpose research ship owned and operated by the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS). BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the island of Bermuda. The Atlantic Explorer is in compliance with USCG, University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) regulations.  Funding will be re-negotiated each year and will be dependent upon the number of days at sea in support of NSF funded research programs. The vessel is scheduled for 167 days at sea in 2012 with 32 individual cruises. All days are in support of National Science Foundation funded science.",
