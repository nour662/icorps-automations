 "awd_abstract_narration": "While the Internet has far exceeded expectations, it has also stretched initial assumptions, often creating tussles that challenge its underlying communication model. Users and applications operate in terms of content, making it increasingly limiting and difficult to conform to IP's requirement to communicate by discovering and specifying location. To carry the Internet into the future, a conceptually simple yet transformational architectural shift is required, from today's focus on where ? addresses and hosts ? to what ? the content that users and applications care about.\r\nThis project investigates a potential new Internet architecture called Named Data Networking (NDN). NDN capitalizes on strengths ? and addresses weaknesses ? of the Internet's current host-based, point-to-point communication architecture in order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of communication. By naming data instead of their location, NDN transforms data into a first-class entity. The current Internet secures the data container. NDN secures the contents, a design choice that decouples trust in data from trust in hosts, enabling several radically scalable communication mechanisms such as automatic caching to optimize bandwidth.  The project studies the technical challenges that must be addressed to validate NDN as a future Internet architecture:  routing scalability, fast forwarding, trust models, network security, content protection and privacy, and fundamental communication theory. The project uses end-to-end testbed deployments, simulation, and theoretical analysis to evaluate the proposed architecture, and is developing specifications and prototype implementations of NDN protocols and applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project established the groundwork for a new theory of networked communication for content-centric networking architectures such as NDN (Named Data Networking).  Outcomes in intellectual merit include the following.  The project developed optimal dynamic forwarding and caching algorithms for maximizing the total user demand satisfied by an NDN network.  These algorithms are derived from the new VIP framework relying on the new device of Virtual Interest Packets (VIPs), which captures the measured demand for the respective data objects in the network.  The project has developed two instantiations of the VIP framework, called Algorithms 1 and 2, both of which use the VIP count as a common metric for determining both the forwarding and caching algorithms.   The project has determined the VIP network stability region, the set of all IP arrival rates which can be satisfied by some feasible forwarding and caching policy in an NDN network.  The project has proved that the forwarding/caching policy in Algorithm 1 is throughput optimal, in the sense of adaptively maximizing the user demand rate satisfied by an NDN network.  The project has shown that Algorithm 2 achieves not only load balancing but also stable caching configurations. Numerical experiments have been carried out to compare the joint caching-forwarding VIP algorithm (Algorithm 2) against several baseline routing and caching policies. Results show conclusively that the VIP joint forwarding/caching algorithm has significantly improved performance in terms of user delay and the rate of cache hits. The project has further investigated fair congestion control for NDN networks using the VIP framework.  Unlike traditional network settings, the project focused on fairness among content objects, rather than source-destination pairs.   The project has developed a joint congestion control, forwarding and caching algorithm that yields a VIP throughput vector which can be arbitrarily chose to the optimal solution of a utility maximization problem, while keeping all VIP queues stable.  The project has also developed fair congestion control schemes to obtain a tradeoff between the utility gained by admitting more demand into the network layer, and the incurred average network delay.  Finally, the project has investigated the throughput and delay scaling laws for information-centric wireless networks with caching.  The project examined a wireless network in which nodes are uniformly distributed at random in the network area.  Each node has a limited-capacity Content Store, which it uses to cache contents according to the proposed caching scheme.  The project considered a content-centric traffic model with a general content popularity distribution, where users use multihop communication to retrieve the requested content from the closest cache.  The project derived the throughput-delay tradeoff of the proposed network paradigm for a general content popularity distribution, and solved the problem of joint optimization of caching and forwarding strategies.  The network performance was evaluated for a Zipf content popularity distribution, while letting the number of content types and the network size both go to infinity.  The project extended the analysis in various directions, considering contents with different sizes and hybrid network scenarios.\n\nOutcomes in broader impact include the following.  The project has led to the training of a new generation of researchers, engineers, and professionals in the area of data networking, ready to spearhead the development of new networking protocols suitable for our data-rich world.  Specifically, one postdoc, four graduate students, and two undergraduate students , including two women, have received research and educational training in the information-centric networking area.   The project is inherently multi-institutional.  The project built important collaboration networks with Caltech, Cisco Systems, University of Arizona, University of Mary..."
