 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Professor Jeffrey N. Johnston of the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University to develop new protic acid-catalyzed reactions to form carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom (nitrogen and/or oxygen) bonds.  An emphasis continues with the identification and development of functional groups (e.g. diazo alkanes and azides) that can be activated toward carbon-carbon bond formation by protic acids without protonative self-decomposition.  Underlying the development activities is a study of the mechanistic pathways involved and the elucidation of factors leading to high selectivity.  This approach will secure a fundamental understanding of reactivity, and in so doing, provide a framework for broader conceptual application and development.  The development of diastereoselective variations of these reactions will be an emphasis of this phase, leading ultimately to their application in the synthesis of complex contiguous aminopolyols.  \r\n\r\nThis research aims to develop greener chemical methods to more rapidly and efficiently prepare chiral small molecules.  Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.  This project also provides research training for graduate and undergraduate students and contributes to the development of a workforce in STEM fields.",
