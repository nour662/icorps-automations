 "awd_abstract_narration": "INTELLECTUAL MERIT\r\nMitochondria, the structures inside cells where energy is harnessed from food, are moved and shaped in specialized cells such as neurons and sperm to fulfill different energy needs.  Spermatogenesis (sperm cell formation) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal context for determining the molecular basis of mitochondrial shaping, since mitochondria undergo dramatic events during sperm development, and since the fruit fly is a well-characterized model organism.  The project addresses two broad questions: 1) do tissue-specific ATP synthase subunits control tissue-specific mitochondrial shaping, and 2) how are distinct mitochondrial populations defined and maintained within the same cell?  Both will be pursued through genetic and molecular analysis of Drosophila male sterile mutants showing defects in the Nebenkern, the structure in post-meiotic spermatids that consists of exactly two interwrapped giant mitochondrial derivatives.  The hypothesis that a testis-expressed version of an ATP synthase subunit contributes to the dramatic internal structure of the Nebenkern will be tested through microscopy, molecular biology, fly husbandry, and transgenic techniques.  Roles for testis-expressed paralogs of other ATP synthase subunits will also be explored.  In addition, to determine how distinct mitochondrial populations are defined, the role of Parkin and PINK1 proteins in the segregation of the two mitochondrial derivatives in the Nebenkern will be assessed. The research could demonstrate how tissue-specific mitochondrial morphology is governed by specific ATP synthase isoforms, as well as how distinct viable mitochondrial populations are maintained.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS\r\nThe project will result in the research training of many undergraduate students including four to eight students each academic semester and three summer students.  Additionally, one undergraduate student per summer from a historically black college or university (HBCU) will be involved in the research.  Davidson students from underrepresented groups in science will also be encouraged to embark upon research in the laboratory.  A laboratory technician (usually a recent college graduate aiming to attend graduate school) will also receive research training.  For most students this will be their first research experience.  All students will be mentored in scientific communication and data presentation, and they will present their work at the Davidson College research symposia that occur annually in May and September.  A subset of these students will present their experimental results at the Annual Drosophila Research Conference.  Outcomes will be tracked as these students embark upon careers in science.  In addition, elements of the project will be integrated into the teaching of a Genetics course so that the entire class (approximately 32 undergraduate students per year) will carry out original research and will be challenged and stimulated to make publishable discoveries.",
