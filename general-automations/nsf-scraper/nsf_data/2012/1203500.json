 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses two problems that are facing our nation: \r\no\tThere are not enough technicians to support continued technological innovation or to staff the industries that could improve our country's security and economic position in the world.  \r\no\tThere are not adequate educational opportunities for capable, struggling high school students who need - and deserve - an opportunity to enter a rewarding career. \r\n\r\nThere are tools and institutions in place to solve these problems: \r\no\tAssociate-degree technical-education programs. Community and technical colleges offer these programs, often developed initially with Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program support, using curricula and teaching materials that have been informed by the industries and employers who want to hire technicians. They are taught by capable faculty members who have been educated in both the content and in the strategies that can help technical students succeed in their careers.\r\no\tHigh School STEM programs and academies. Specialized STEM programs have been formed over the past decade to interest, attract, and cultivate students to enter postsecondary education in preparation for careers in engineering, science, and technology.\r\n\r\nThe dilemma is this:\r\no\tMost of the colleges offering technician education in the new and emerging technologies do not have an adequate number of capable students enrolling in and completing their associate degree programs.\r\no\tMost of the high school STEM programs are not attracting and serving the students who have the greatest potential to become the technicians we need. \r\n\r\nThis project is developing a set of papers to be distributed electronically and in a publication that \r\n\r\no\tPresent a compelling, urgent and factual need for creating secondary/post-secondary Career Pathways for STEM technicians.\r\no\tProvide information about the breadth of curricula and AS/AAS college programs to educate STEM technicians.\r\no\tDescribe the vision, strategies and models for extending high school STEM programs and academies to support potential technician students.\r\no\tProvide information and secondary school guidance strategies for identifying and encouraging high school students with the potential to be successful as STEM technicians.\r\no\tShowcase models of high school - college pipelines to support a STEM technician programs.\r\n\r\nThe target audiences for the publications are high school STEM leaders, leaders in community colleges, and those affecting educational policy at the local, state and federal levels. The project is coordinating and editing papers from authors with a wide range of expertise in areas that affect technician education.\r\n\r\nThe PI has been active in developing Career Pathways, and he has written and edited other books in this area. The project is following up the release of the publication with selected speaking engagements to state and national audiences, and with strategies that encourage interested people to access the electronic form of the articles and the entire publication.  In addition, the project is collecting information on how the publication is used and what is its effect on technician programs.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit lies in the information contained about STEM technician needs, the vision and methodology to create the alternate Career Pathways and the examples of models for creating high school pipelines for STEM technician programs at two year colleges.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact is the potential changes needed to encourage and accommodate potential STEM technicians through new Career Pathways, which should result in larger enrollments, lower student attrition, and more well-educated technicians.",
