 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support participants from the US attending the IV Latin-American Congress on Lie Groups and Geometry in CIMAT, Guanajuato, Mexico, August 27-31, 2012. The study of Lie groups in Geometry has a long history, developed by figures such as Sophus Lie, Felix Klein, Wilhelm Killing, Elie Cartan, Hermann Weyl, etc. In particular, Klein proposed that specifying an appropriate transformation group leaving certain geometric objects invariant, one would then observe various geometries. At the global level, whenever a Lie group acts on a geometric object, such as a Riemannian manifold, this action provides a measure of rigidity and yields a rich algebraic structure in terms of its Representation Theory on tensors, cohomology groups, etc. The scientific focus of the conference is the interaction between Lie Group Theory, Geometry and Topology in the broadest possible sense. Topics to be touched upon in the conference will be: infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and their applications to geometry and topology, infinite dimensional  representations as spaces of functions on a manifold, representation theory of Real Semisimple Lie Groups and Integrable Systems, actions of the mapping class group on the representation varieties of surface groups, special holonomy, proper affine actions on Minkowski space, Lie groups and their arithmetic subgroups, tessellations of homogeneous spaces, unipotent dynamics, etc.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the fourth Latin-American Congress on Lie Groups and Geometry is to disseminate the latest developments in the area to both senior and junior mathematicians. This meeting will bring together researchers from all over Latin-America, USA and Europe, working in diverse areas related by their use of Lie groups in their different facets, namely geometrical, topological, algebraic, etc. It will also raise awareness of the excellent academic work taking place in Latin America and provide a networking opportunity for researchers and students. Graduate students and postdocs will especially benefit from the interaction with the senior mathematicians. Researchers working in developing countries will have the chance to interact with their counterparts from the USA and Europe. https://sites.google.com/site/4liegroupsandgeometry/home",
