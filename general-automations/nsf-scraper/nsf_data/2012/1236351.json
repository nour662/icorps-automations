Despite its prevalence in engineering and biological flows, the previous work on flow separation from a hemispheroid-like object, or bump, on a wall has all been limited to steady freestream flow conditions, thus creating a significant void in the knowledge base.  The overall objective of the investigation is to understand flow structures produced by three-dimensional flow separation in pulsatile flow over a 2:1 aspect ratio prolate hemispheroid on a wall. The outcomes of this work will provide insight not only into bioengineering flow applications, but also contribute to the broader topic of unsteady three-dimensional flow separation from smoothly-contoured objects on a boundary.  It will be determined how flow structures interact with the wall in order to elucidate their impact on the shear stress and pressure signature on the wall both upstream and downstream of the protuberance. This secondary objective is of great importance because bioengineering flows are most concerned with fluid-structure interactions that elicit a biological response (e.g. pressure loadings that drive the dynamics of voiced speech, and wall shear stresses that have been linked to atherosclerosis). A suite of experimental investigations will be performed in a wind tunnel, utilizing time-resolved particle image velocimetry, laser Doppler anemometry, wall pressure measurements, skin friction line visualization, and oil-film interferometry, in order to resolve the separated flow morphologies, and their interaction with flow parameters of interest on the wall. The transformative potential of the proposed study is to facilitate the development of an unprecedented ability to design systems that take advantage of inherent features of unsteady 3-D separated flows.\r\n\r\nDetailed study and understanding of separated 3-D flows in pulsatile flows constitutes the intellectual merit of the proposed study. Vocal fold polyps and nodules are hemispheroidal protuberances that develop on the vocal folds, altering the fluid loading that drives voiced speech and produces sound. Magnetically-targeted drug delivery in the arteries results in hemispheroidal conglomerations on the arterial surface, disrupting the hemodynamics. In both scenarios, the protuberance interacts with a pulsatile flow field. Found not only in biomedical, but also engineering applications, pulsatile flow over a bump on a wall presents a fundamental fluid mechanics problem involving three-dimensional flow separation, complex vortex shedding patterns, and fluid-structure interactions along the downstream wall. The proposed research is applicable to the aforementioned examples of bioengineering flows, as well as to the broader case of flow separation from objects that are located in a buffeting wake (e.g. automobile and marine aerodynamics, wind turbine performance, etc.), and also to environmental flows and contaminant transport around hills and berms.  The proposed research plan will achieve broader impacts by (1) benefiting engineering and societal environments, (2) increasing participation of undergraduates and underrepresented groups, and (3) K-12 outreach programs.  Furthermore, the grant will facilitate the training of a Ph.D. student and a post-doctoral scholar.  Dissemination of information will be achieved through scholarly publications, conference proceedings, and the archival of data on the PIs existing research website.  Additionally, several mentoring activities for post-doctoral scientists, graduate, and high school students are underway.",

In previously reported studies, the free stream flow over the obstacle was steady, i.e. constant velocity unidirectional flow. Unsteady, pulsatile flows (ones which pulse like a beating heart) occur frequently in biology, geophysics, biomedical engineering, etc. Our study was aimed at extending the existing comprehensive knowledge base for steady flows to considerably more complex pulsatile flows. We studied the pulsating airflow around a wall-mounted half sphere (visualize a ball cut in half and attached to a horizontal surface like a Quonset hut on an ice field).&nbsp; This study was inspired by flow around pathological growths on human vocal folds, known as polyps, and their role in degrading speech production.</p>\n<p>The experiments were carried out in a special unsteady flow wind tunnel and employed several experimental techniques. The pulsatile flow field was produced by periodically blocking the flow in test section with a set of rotating shutters downstream of the test section (see Figures 1 &amp; 2). When the shutters were fully open, air flowed freely and the velocity over the hemisphere was high, and when the shutters closed the wind speed decreased significantly (nearly stagnant). The air velocity distribution around the hemisphere was measured using the Particle Image Velocimetry technique (PIV). PIV is a state-of-the art, non-invasive, laser-based technique that produces instantaneous snapshots of the fluid velocity vector field in an entire plane illuminated by the laser sheet. &nbsp;Various planes are measured by moving the laser sheet to regions of interest around the obstacle. &nbsp;A schematic diagram of the of the wind tunnel used in the experiments, along with a representative pulsatile flow velocity profile, are depicted in Figure 1, with a corresponding photograph in Figure 3. &nbsp;One of the quantities derived from the PIV velocity field data is known as &ldquo;swirling strength&rdquo;. &nbsp;Swirling strength is a mathematical way of identifying an area of swirl in the flow field, i.e. marking a vortex.&nbsp; The results figures show swirling strength contour maps &ndash; different colors corresponding to different swirling strength magnitude (red colors denote high swirl and blue low swirl).</p>\n<p>Our flow measurements revealed some surprising and unintuitive physics. &nbsp;Remarkably, the vortices moved in the direction <em>opposite</em> to the main flow in the wind tunnel during a portion of the cycle.&nbsp; This phenomenon had not been reported previously for steady flow experiments and was unexpected even in pulsatile flow because the freestream velocity is never negative, i.e. air always flows forward in the wind tunnel test section (see Figure 1).

We found an explanation for this phenomenon by examining vortex rings (for example smoke rings), which will propel themselves in still air. This self-propelled phenomenon is known as self-induced propagation of vortex rings. In the wake of the wall-mounted hemisphere (and other wall-mounted obstacles) a flow structure exists that is similar to a vortex ring - the recirculation arch vortex.
