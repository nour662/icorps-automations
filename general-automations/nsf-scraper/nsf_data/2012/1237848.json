 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project will comprise a substantial national effort to translate nanophotonic and nanoplasmonic research discoveries into innovative products in biosensing applications.  A challenge for the implementation of these biosensors relates to methods of  delivering power to drive those sensors for the targeted bio-feedback.  This AIR project proposes to use nanoplasmonic metamaterial methods to model and demonstrate a compact directional power harvesting system that relies on subwavelength-scale arrayed structures to yield a rectifying antenna or rectenna.  A prototype system shows promise for improvements to the key wireless power transmission metric, specific  power density, by at least an order of magnitude to ~0.1 W/g.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the outcomes of this AIR project would revolutionalize power delivery to portable sensors and equipment and transform the design space for implanted biosensors that measure and control biological functions in vivo.",
