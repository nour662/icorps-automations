 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description: Cluster beam deposition of metal chalcogenide nanoparticles into films is performed in combination with evaporative or ion-assisted deposition of an organic phase. These deposition methods improve control of nanoparticle surface chemistry and morphology for the development of high-efficiency, stable photovoltaic films. Nanoparticle surface chemistry and heterojunction bonding in films are probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and laser desorption vacuum ultraviolet postionization mass spectrometry. Dynamic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is utilized to probe the photophysics of these films by examining their photoinduced charging in an element-specific fashion, without the need for metal overlayers for electrical contact.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description: This research project contributes to fundamental knowledge of the relationship of nanoparticle surface chemistry to film photovoltaic behavior and, ultimately, to production of high-efficiency solar cells using low-cost, abundant materials. One broader educational impact is the development of mentoring seminars for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. These seminars prepare participants for diverse careers in academia, industry, or government by discussing job placement, interviewing, proposals, job expectations, the balance of career with personal goals, and related issues.",
