 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to achieve key technology, infrastructure, and\r\nregulatory science advances for next generation medical systems based\r\non the concept of medical application platforms (MAPs). A MAP is a\r\nsafety/security-critical real-time computing platform for: (a)\r\nintegrating heterogeneous devices and medical IT systems, (b) hosting\r\napplication programs (\"apps\") that provide medical utility through the\r\nability to both acquire information and update/control integrated\r\ndevices, IT systems, and displays. The project will develop formal\r\narchitectural and behavioral specification languages for defining\r\nMAPs, with a focus on techniques that enable compositional reasoning\r\nabout MAP component interoperability and safety. These formal\r\nlanguages will include an extensible property language to enable the\r\nspecification of real-time, quality-of-service, and attributes\r\nspecific to medical contexts that can be leveraged by code generation,\r\ntesting, and verification tools.\r\n\r\nThe project will work closely with a synergistic team of clinicians,\r\ndevice industry partners, regulators, and medical device\r\ninteroperability and safety standard organizations to develop an open\r\nsource MAP innovation platform to enable key stakeholders within the\r\nnation's health care ecosphere to identify, prototype, and evaluate\r\nsolutions to key technology and regulatory challenges that must be\r\novercome to develop a commodity market of regulated MAP components.\r\nBecause MAPs provide pre-built certified infrastructure and building\r\nblocks for rapidly developing multi-device medical applications, this\r\nresearch has the potential to usher in a new paradigm of medical\r\nsystem that significantly increases the pace of innovation, lowers\r\ndevelopment costs, enables new functionality by aggregating multiple\r\ndevices into a system of systems, and achieves greater system safety.",
