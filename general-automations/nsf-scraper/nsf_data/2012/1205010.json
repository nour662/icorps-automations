The project is helping NVC use innovative linkages with high schools, four-year institutions, and industry partners to increase the number of technicians with current knowledge and skills entering the nanotechnology workforce. Project ION's activities are being guided by the objectives of innovation, implementation and regional adaptation. Project ION is demonstrating effective ways that two-year institutions can creatively lead partnerships with four-year institutions, research organizations, and industry partners to provide nanotechnology-related learning, research, and career development activities for STEM students. It is also creating new models for nanotechnology-focused workforce development activities for underserved populations.",

In addition, Project ION focused on community outreach and awareness of nanotechnology through the development of cutting edge classroom activities, internship opportunities, memorandum of agreements with potential employers, and career placement&mdash;with an additional aim of determining best practices for pursuing the development of a future ATE Projects grant.\n\nOver the past 3 years, project leadership successfully created a foundation of proven best practices; enhanced NVC\u00c6s inter-connected networks of support and resource sharing among the formal education system, research and development organizations, and industry, and piloted a robust high school and community college faculty professional development program.  These activities helped NVC to generate new interest in high-tech STEM disciplines. In addition, these activities have prepared educators to integrate Nanotechnology into classrooms, and plan for regional and statewide expansion of our education program.  A summary of accomplishments and activities delineating the impact of Project ION include:\n\nProgram Development and Improvement\n\nA formal 10 member San Antonio Nanotechnology Forum (SANTF) Committee was established in the greater San Antonio area.\n154 students participated in Remote Access laboratory project that was piloted through NACK center at local high schools/districts; \n20 high school students attended in the week-long Summer Nanotechnology Institute; \nSix students participated in hands-on research and project based internship program with Southwest Research Institute; \nOver 200 High School students visited Nanotechnology Table during College and Career Fest at Southwest Independent School District (ISD); \n46 student members joined a Nanotechnology Club that was established at Southwest high school; \n300 students participated in Nanotechnology Day at Natalie High school; \n50 students visited Nanotechnology table during Career Day at Holmes high school; \nThree NVC students were selected to attend NanoJapan Program that was hosted by Rice University as part of a NSF grant; \nTwo NVC students were accepted into the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) Research Experience for Undergraduates Program; \nFive students earned a Student Award for Excellence by the NSF at Annual ATE PI Conference; \nMentoring and partnership opportunities were utilized from two existing ATE Centers to develop Project ION as the first phase of a program that engages high school students and educators in nanotechnology learning activities; \n\n\nProfessional Development for Educators\n\n15 high school and community college STEM faculty participated in the week-long summer \"Educate the Educators\" workshop in 2013, in which 11 faculty Cohort returned subsequent year in 2014.\n14 high school and community college faculty participated in a Remote Access workshop.\nNanotechnology Teaching and Learning kits developed by NCLT center at Northwestern University and SCEM center at University of New Mexico were distributed to 10 local high schools and 1 sister college. Teachers implemented the teaching materials to their classrooms, workshops, and STEM event that yields 1,165 students being benefited from nanotechnology education.   \n\n\nConferences, Workshops, and Seminars\n\nNVC organized and hosted a 1-day First-Ever Nanotechnology Conference in Greater San Antonio, Texas, on October 18, 2013 (over 150 attendees)&mdash;co-hosted in every year of the grant afterwards.\nDr. Zhou (PI) attended and presen..."
