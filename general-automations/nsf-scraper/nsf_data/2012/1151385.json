 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrent limitations in the preparation and utilization of photoresponsive moieties have inhibited the development of enabling technologies that use the advantages of light-responsive polymers in new ways.  The research objective of this award is to develop polymeric materials that have new photoresponsive properties because of the inclusion of photolabile groups, such as the o-nitrobenzylester (NBE) moiety.  The central hypothesis of this research is that rational design of polymers with photolabile groups will enable photochemical control over the non-covalent intermolecular forces governed by hydrophobicity and charge-charge interactions.  This research will focus on three classes of new light-responsive polymeric systems: 1) new block copolymers designed to switch from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, 2) layer-by-layer (LbL) polyelectrolyte films that switch interlayer electrostatic forces from attractive to repulsive, and 3) surface-bound polymeric coatings that switch the sign of the zeta potential.  The proposed work is significant because it combines polymer synthesis and photochemistry to control intermolecular forces, resulting in new approaches to control matter with light.  Expected outcomes of this research include polymers that photo-assemble into and disassemble from micelles, LbL films that are photopatternable in three dimensions, and coatings that enable photochemical control over electroosmotic fluid flow and static charging.  These outcomes have potential applications in: 1) photochemically-labile carriers for targeted delivery, 2) all-aqueous photolithography, 3) photo-controlled microfluidic devices, and 4) photochemical control over the static charging of insulators.  \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nMaterials that respond to light have major technological importance, with applications ranging from human health (e.g. imaging agents and photochemical delivery of therapeutic agents) to microprocessor fabrication (e.g. high-resolution patterning of polymers in photolithography).  The proposed interdisciplinary research will develop polymers that respond to light in new ways with both fundamental and applied implications.  The proposed work also integrates this research with education through two new programs: 1) encouraging STEM careers by involving a local community college in scientific research; 2) a high school science fair mentoring program.",

Regarding intellectual merit, we categorize the outcomes of this project into three groups:</p>\n<p><em>1. The use of light to degrade individual, nanoscale segments of compartmentalized polymer films.</em> The polymer coating fabrication approach of \"layer-by-layer assembly\" enables the user to deposit very thin (1-5 nanometers) layers of electrically charged polymers onto a variety of substrates sequentially in a \"bottom-up\" fabrication process. The location of different polymers can be somewhat restricted within the thickness of coatings. In our research, we demonstrated that we can use light to dissolve one compartment selectively, while leaving the others intact. Subsequently, by using different colors of light, we can dissolve other compartments within the same coating. We demonstrated the power of this novel approach to controlling matter on the nanoscale in several ways:</p>\n<p>&bull; By dissolving a compartment between the rest of the coating and its substrate, we could de-laminate thin (~ 200 nm), free-standing films from their substrates (see figure for an image of a delaminated film). Such free standing films have potential applications as membranes and devices for delivering therapeutic cargo.</p>\n<p>&bull; By dissolving compartments in sequence from the outside of the coating to the inside, we could prepare arbitrary patterns of polymer films at multiple discrete thicknesses (see figure for a microscopic image of an example). Such approaches have potential application in new methods of micro- and nano-fabrication.</p>\n<p><em>2. Photochemical patterning of polymers for organic electronics</em>: Conjugated materials, a subset of organic small molecules and polymers, are leading candidates for complementing existing semiconductor technology in applications such as transistors and displays. Although one of their primary advantages is the ability to use relatively inexpensive solvent-based techniques for their processing, this feature also makes difficult the fabrication of multilayer films that are often required in their target applications. In our research, we designed and demonstrated novel conjugated polymers with which light could be used to remove selectively the parts of the conjugated polymer that made them soluble after processing into thin films. Furthermore, we used this approach to prepare micron-scale patterns of these polymers, and prepared several photopatterned multi-level films. Finally, we harnessed newfound fundamental understanding of how structure influences the solubility of these polymers to design and demonstrate a conjugated polymer that can be patterned upon rinsing with either aqueous solutions or organic solvent, with the photochemically-induced patterns being opposite depending on which of these developing solutions were used. See the attached figure for examples of a photopatterned multilevel film, and how different rinsing conditions yielded opposite patterns of this polymer.</p>\n<p><em>3. Photodegradable gels and nanoparticles</em>: Insoluble soft polymers swollen with water&mdash;hydrogels&mdash;are leading candidates for materials that deliver therapeutics. In our research, we demonstrated a new class of gels that were i) prepared by a known, versatile polymerization technique (Ring opening metathesis polymerization, or \"ROMP\") <em>and</em> ii) could be rendered soluble using light. To do so, we designed and prepared a range of specialized cross-linking molecules that both resulted in gelation, and contained a photo-labile linker in the middle of their structures, such that the cross-links could be broken with light. See attached figure for an example of the photoinduced gel-to-solution transition. We also demonstrated light-induced release of guest cargo from these gels, and showed in seperate experiments that polymeric nanoparticles could also be degraded with light using a related chemical strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Benefit to Society:</em> Both the fundamental insights regarding how chemical structure influences the properties of photoreactive polymers, and the specific approaches and materials prepared in this research, have potential for technological benefits to society in the areas of triggered drug delivery, flexible electronics, and micro/nano fabrication.</p>\n<p><em>Human Resource Development:</em> Funding from this project supported one postdoc (now employed as an industrial chemist) and five graduate students.
