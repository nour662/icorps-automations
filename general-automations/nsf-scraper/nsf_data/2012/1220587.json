 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global emissions of CO2 are acidifying the world's oceans, so the impact of current and future ocean acidification (OA) on marine life is under intense scrutiny.  A growing body of biological evidence demonstrates that OA can impact many aspects of marine organism physiology and that OA responses are highly species-specific.  Species' responses can range, however, from negative to positive, making predictions of \"winners and losers,\" under various scenarios of future ocean environments, difficult.  Physiological responses of individuals within species also vary, yet little attention has been paid to genetically determined variation in physiology that will underpin adaptive responses to increasing OA.  This project focuses on the genomic basis of adaptive metabolic capacities and the potential for the evolution of organisms better able than those of present-day to cope with future levels of ocean acidity. \r\n\tThough most marine invertebrates have a larval stage, present understanding of the biology of these larval forms often limits ability to predict future recruitment to the adult stage or potential \"winners and losers\" under various environment change scenarios.  Fuller understanding of how marine invertebrates will respond to change in the world's oceans requires a merging of information on physiological, genetic and environmental factors.  This study will uncover genotype-by-environment interactions in larval responses to OA for a commercially important bivalve mollusc, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas.  This species has genetic and genomic resources that are unparalleled for most marine animals and permit cross-generational experiments.  Larvae from many different pedigreed families will be screened for differential responses to OA.  Once contrasting responses (phenotypes) are identified, the biochemical, metabolic, and gene-expression bases of the \"winners and losers\" will be identified.  The genetic basis of these physiological responses will then be determined in the following generation, using trait-mapping methods.  Such interdisciplinary experimental approaches provide a mechanistic understanding and will improve prediction of biological adaptation to changing ocean conditions.\r\nEducational outreach will involve all project associates who will give lectures and laboratory demonstrations to K-12 students, first-generation university students, and students from underrepresented groups on national food security, seafood sustainability, biodiversity and conservation, and ocean change.  For the science and policy communities, investigators will disseminate results through publication, conferences, and international collaborations.  The genetic markers and gene-expression profiles created by this project will contribute to ongoing international scientific efforts to annotate and assemble the genome sequence of the Pacific oyster.  As the Principal Investigators have worked closely with the U.S. West Coast oyster industry for more than a decade, research results will translate directly into improved breeding programs for this $100M industry.  Finally, results of these fundamental studies will be directly applicable to other highly fecund marine species, many of which are fish and shellfish of commercial importance that provide a major source of food for human consumption.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n   Background:  Our Planet has undergone continual changes in the many environments that support Life on Earth.  During the past century or so, the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere have resulted in a portion of that gas being absorbed into the World's largest environment -- the global ocean.  As a result, the World's oceans are slowly becoming more acidic.  During this NSF project the investigators studied the metabolic capacities of marine organisms to respond to changes in ocean acidity.  Our experimental approach included a unique merging for the study of marine animals of information on environmental, genetic, and physiological processes (i.e., Phenotype = Genotype + Environment).\n\n   Intellectual Merit:  We focused on early stages of marine animal development that are known to have high sensitivity to environmental change.  Specifically, we added an environmental perspective to the study of one of the best-characterized marine animal model systems -- sea urchins (a group of organisms that formed part of the basis for the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine).  We also studied the larval stages of the Pacific oyster and worked closely with the U.S. West Coast aquaculture industry that is been negatively impacted, economically, by recent failures to produce sufficient \"seed\" oysters to support commercial operations.  A brief summary follows of the major outcomes of this NSF award.\n\n   1.  Physiologically, organisms withstand environmental stress through changes in biochemical regulation that maintain homeostasis.  While responses to environmental stressors involve metabolic costs, the biochemical bases of actual energy demands are rarely quantified.  We investigated this question and found that two processes dominate the energy-requiring needs of growing organisms.  About 70% of the total biological \"energy currency\" of cells, measured as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), was allocated to just two cellular processes -- protein synthesis and maintaining the balance of sodium ions.  Furthermore, we measured the metabolic cost of protein synthesis to determine whether this fundamental \"cost of living\" was influenced by genotype, phenotype, or environment.  We showed that there is no genetic variation in the metabolic cost of protein synthesis, thereby simplifying bioenergetic models.  This finding provided a bioenergetic framework to quantify trade-offs in the use of metabolic energy in response to environmental stress.\n\n   2.  We then applied this knowledge to building a series of energy budget allocation models that could be used to predict the tipping points at which organisms have insufficient cellular energy to respond to additional stress. Surprisingly, we found that developing organisms can cope with more-acidic oceans, but they have to radically alter their cellular energy use to do so.  Under certain environmental stress conditions, about 85% of available energy was allocated to maintain protein synthesis and ion regulation.  This high trade-off in available energy allocation under stress would certainly compromise an organism's ability to support other essential physiological processes.\n\n   3.  A genetic basis is frequently invoked to explain variation in metabolic performance, yet it has remained challenging to study such processes in marine animals due to the lack of genetically-enabled \"model\" organisms.  To address a central question in this NSF project, a series of studies where undertaken using quantitative genetic crosses of pedigreed lines of the Pacific oyster.  Crossbreeding these pedigreed lines provided many different larval families that showed different traits and abilities (phenotypic contrasts) in responding to environmental stress.  For instance, some families altered rates of protein synthesis, while others did not in response to the same level of environmental stress.  Importantly, we showed that there was a wide range of growth responses and that some families produced by crossbreeding showed high resilience to ocean acidification.  These findings show that resilience to ocean acidification may exist among certain genotypes.\n\n   Broader Impacts:  As a group, oysters are the marine animals that are most raised in global commercial aquaculture.  Recent failures of larval Pacific oyster hatchery production along the U.S. West Coast have highlighted negative impacts of environmental change on marine organisms, in general, and aquaculture species, specifically.  One of the practical outcomes of our project is the demonstration that a genetically-based resilience to ocean acidification may exist in subsets of current populations.  This finding could provide new approaches for increasing yields and production in commercial aquaculture operations.  For the general scientific community, in addition to publishing our work in noteworthy peer-reviews scientific journals, we presented over two dozen presentations at a range of difference scientific conferences, such as the American Physiological Society; International Larval Biology Symposium; National Shellfisheries Association; Ocean Sciences International Meeting; Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology.  Our group of scientists engaged in extensive interactions in public outreach through presentations and discussions in educational programs for numerous middle and high school students, and their families.  The focus of these educational and outreach activities in basic science also included broad societal issues regarding national food security, seafood sustainability, biodiversity, conservation, and global ocean change.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donal T Manahan"
