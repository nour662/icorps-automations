  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPredator-prey interactions are very common in nature - most animals are either trying to eat something or trying not to be eaten by something else.  These interactions cause the numbers of predators and prey to fluctuate over time: predator numbers increase when prey are abundant and decrease when prey are scarce, and prey numbers increase when predators are rare and decrease when predators are common.  Predators and prey are also continually adapting to each other.  Prey evolve defenses against predation (e.g., thicker, tougher shells) and predators evolve counter-defenses (e.g., bigger, stronger jaws).  These adaptations affect how many prey are eaten by predators, and consequently, affect the fluctuations in numbers of predators and prey.  What is unknown is how predator and prey adaptations affect those fluctuations and the overall numbers of each species.  \n\nThis work developed new mathematical models and theory to explain how adaptations in predators and prey affect fluctuations in their abundances.  When adaptation is not possible, fluctuations in predator and prey numbers follow a predictable pattern: prey increase because predators are rare, predators increase because their prey are abundant, prey decline because predators are common, predators decline because prey are scarce, and the cycle repeats.  The new theory developed in this work predicts that when prey and predators are adapting to each other, very different kinds of patterns can emerge.  For example, adaptation can lead to reverse of the pattern described above. This is surprising because the reversed fluctuations suggest that the prey are eating their predators.  More importantly, this theory identifies how adaptations in predators and prey can have large effects at the scale of whole populations and completely change how the numbers of those populations fluctuate in time.  Thus, the theory identifies particular patterns to look for in population data.  Applying the theory to data from different systems in nature identified cases where adaptation was causing these new kinds of fluctuations.  Thus, the theory increases our knowledge of what is driving fluctuations in those systems.  \n\nIn addition to the increase in scientific knowledge, this project contributed to the training and education of three graduate students and one undergraduate student through graduate and undergraduate research mentoring.  Collaborations on other scientific questions with two other graduate students were also started and completed during this time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael H Cortez"
