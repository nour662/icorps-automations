 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate the dynamics and control of hummingbird flight.  Two species of hummingbirds of different sizes and two species of insect (hawkmoth and wasps) will be used, and an integrative approach based on animal experiments, mathematical modeling, theoretical analysis, and engineering experiments will be performed.  The goal of this work is to provide a general theory for animal flight maneuverability, stability and control through a series of targeted experiments.  This research will directly contribute to the development of new, improved models of flight mechanics, and it will substantially advance our understanding of one of the major forms of animal locomotion. Ultimately this scientific basis will not only advance the theory of animal flight but also provide design guidelines for bio-inspired engineering systems with superior stability and maneuverability. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will enhance the infrastructure for research and education through interdisciplinary research in biology and engineering.  The research results will be disseminated broadly to the biology, physics, and engineering research communities.  The theories developed in this work can potentially be translated into other forms of locomotion.  Advances in high performance flapping wing micro aerial vehicles can be used in civilian and defense applications such as search and rescue in collapsed buildings, or indoor surveillance such as in crowded airports. Building upon their historically-successful outreach activities including various television, film, radio, web-based and newspaper reports, the PIs will continue on their active outreach effort with the goal of engaging general public, pre-college students, K-12 students in scientific research and generating scientific excitement and awareness through various public activities and events.\r\nAbstract",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur research advanced understanding of several fundamental aspects of bird flight.  We revealed the way hummingbirds accomplish spectacular escape maneuvers, their aerodynamics during turning while hovering and while flying steadily during cruising flight.  We also described how they dissipate heat during flight.  For doves and finches, we revealed their functional transition from wing to leg forces during landing and the aerodynamics of their unique wingbeat styles including the first description of clap-and-peel forces in doves.  We also demonstrated the mechanics of sound production by feathers during take-off in pigeons and the functional significance of wing extension and flexion during flapping and gliding flight in raptors.  Our broader impacts were diverse including public lectures, interviews in various media (television, website, magazines, newspapers, books), laboratory visits by K-12 students, and development of web-based outreach including a new website, two YouTube pages, and a Facebook page.  We provided research training for two post-doctoral fellows, five graduate students, and over 30 undergraduates.  Our work is being used by biologists and engineers who are pursuing biologically-inspired design of flying robots.  Funding under the grant motivated a grant from a private foundation that improved infrastructure for research involving animal locomotion at the Field Research Station at Fort Missoula.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bret W Tobalske"
