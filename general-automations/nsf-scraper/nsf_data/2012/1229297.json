The instrument additionally includes augmentation of traditional interfaces that support research in 3D merger of graphics and video-coding, augmented reality and human perception research. It will also be used a to further advance the development of novel algorithms and techniques for large-scale data analysis and visualization, immersive virtual environments and image coding, as well as their on-going collaborations with scientists and researchers at national laboratories and industry. As evidenced by the availability of very large flat-panel displays and basic tracking systems such as Xbox Kinect, these types of coders, displays, and tracking systems should become more mature and affordable in the future. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe proposed instrument can greatly impact the areas of telemedicine, manufacturing, and robotics. It can also be used for classes on computer graphics, virtual environments, data visualization, multi-media, and computer gaming. The PIs propose to organize summer programs to attract high-school students into \r\nscience and STEM related areas.",
