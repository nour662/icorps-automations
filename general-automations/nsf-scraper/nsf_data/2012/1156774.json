 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to Purdue University that will provide research training for eight students for ten weeks during the summers of 2012-2014. The program provides advanced training for undergraduate students in the manipulation and analysis of proteins. It facilitates deep understanding of experimental laboratory research, insights into protein biochemistry, and contemplation of the broader context of research. A wide range of student research projects mentored by faculty in the Department of Biochemistry is available. Examples include the experimental analysis of enzyme mechanisms, post-translational protein modifications, proteomics, and protein-nucleic acid interactions studied in the biological context of cell cycle control, chromatin regulation, and renewable energy research. Problem-based modules presented during the first week of the program introduce key concepts in protein biochemistry and experimental design. The remaining nine weeks emphasize full-time research supplemented with weekly sessions on ethical conduct in research, professional communication, GRE preparation, and the graduate school application process. At the end of the program, students will present their results at a departmental symposium and a university-wide poster session. The program will recruit life science and chemistry undergraduates who have an interest in research. Students who are members of underrepresented groups in STEM fields are encouraged to apply. Student recruitment efforts include direct mail pieces to selected institutions, an internet presence linked to the websites of appropriate professional organization, and enhanced connections with existing Purdue University programs that promote research opportunities for students from underrepresented groups. Students are selected based on academic performance, demonstrated interest in research, and the potential for outstanding research careers in the life sciences. Student career decisions will be tracked to assess the lasting impact of the research experience. Multiple methods will be used to evaluate the program including the REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://www.ag.purdue.edu/biochem/Pages/REU.aspx, or by contacting the PI (Dr. James Forney at forney@purdue.edu).",
