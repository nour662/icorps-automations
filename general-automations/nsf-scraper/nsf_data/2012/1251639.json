 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) grant provides funding for developing materials and methods for the low temperature, directed synthesis of graphene and graphene nanostructures on a variety of substrates.  Graphene is a very promising new organic electronic material that can possess conductivity much greater than silicon, the primary semiconductor material in today?s consumer electronic devices. However, the high temperature processes used today for graphene growth hinder the integration of graphene into electronic device materials and processes. A novel approach for low temperature graphene growth is proposed here and involves the use of aromatic precursors for graphene. Processes for depositing those precursors in a well controlled manner onto surfaces will be developed as well as processes for the low temperature conversion of the precursor coatings to graphene.  Three primary approaches will be tested for developing such graphene precursor and processing approaches.  One is a solution-based approach, another relies on surface reactive layers to capture the precursors and the third will explore the controlled deposition of exfoliated graphene.  A range of methods will be utilized to characterize the quality and properties of the graphene and graphitic materials that result from such processes.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to new methods for the low temperature deposition and formation of graphene on a variety of substrates.  The primary goal of this work is to establish the feasibility of such approaches to low temperature graphene formation, such that graphene could be more widely and easily integrated into a variety of optoelectronic applications that are currently impractical with present high temperature graphene synthesis procedures.  Such integration of graphene into electronic devices could enable a number of advancements including: better optical detectors integrated with CMOS, faster flexible organic electronic devices, and faster computer processors with lower heat dissipation and lower power consumption.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to test the hypothesis that graphene, a special form of carbon with unique and exciting electrical properties, could be made using specially designed precursor molecules and carefully chosen processing conditions at low temperatures (i.e. below 400 C).  Such low temperature manufacturing of graphene is critical in order to enable the use of the material in many applications such as semiconductor devices like the microchips that power modern cell phones, tablets, and computers.  One of the outcomes of this work has been that several new precursor molecules that can be used to make graphene at moderate temperatures have been synthesized, characterized, and used to make graphene.  Another major outcome of the work has been that a method for forming monolayers, i.e. layers that are only one molecule thick, of precursor molecules on surfaces that can subsequently be converted into graphene has been developed.  This development is important since it allows graphene precursors to be used that are not volatile and which are difficult to deposit in thin film form from solution processing.  The final and perhaps most important technical outcome of the project is that it has been shown that it is possible to make graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), a form of graphene that has very useful electrical properties for making electronic devices such as integrated circuits, at very low temperatures (&lt;250 C) by confining graphene precursors into very small nanoscale channels.  This confinement of the precursor molecules allows them to have an extended amount of time to react with one another  and thus enables low temperature growth of graphene and GNRs.  Thus, the main intellectual merits of the work have been in advancing the state of the art in the synthesis of graphene at low temperatures.  In terms of broader impacts, the project will impact society technically through the potentially expanded use of graphene in consumer electronics, while the project has impacted workforce development and education through student and teacher training.
