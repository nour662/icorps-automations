The\r\nutility methods confine attention to the most relevant part of the ROC curve. This leads to a\r\nmore meaningful measure of performance, and also reduces sources of extraneous variability\r\nrelative to effect size, thereby leading to a more powerful statistical design of experiments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was developed as part of a one-year Scholar-In-Residence at FDA Fellowship.\n\nThe goal of this project was to investigate utility based methods for analyzing observer performance studies that are used to validate the diagnostic performance of medical imaging technologies. Utility measures incorporate the cost and benefits of right and wrong decisions, whereas the standard measure of performance (area under the ROC curve-AUC) does not.\n\nWe investigated practical aspects of the utility approach, such as statistical power, and found that it appears have an advantage over AUC in that it is more likely to find a significant difference between imaging modalities, when one is actually there, than AUC, with no increase in the false discovery rate.  Over a wide range of different scenarios, we found that 95% of the time the utility approach had greater statistical power.\n\nWe also use the utility approach to reanalyze previously published studies.  Here we found that the utility measure results has larger effect sizes than AUC, but larger components of variance as well.  We found that there is no systematic difference using expected utility (EU) as an endpoint of a study compared to ROC.  We did not find any situations where AUC indicated that one system was best and EU indicated that a different system was best).  We just find that if one system is better, the EU is more likely to find it than the current standard.\n\nWe also investigated the utility approach in the context of more complex studies that are gaining in popularity.  These include studies that investigate localization in addition to detection performannce, and allow for multiple abnormalities in an image.  Many of these approaches have been proposed (LROC, FROC, AFROC1, AFROC2, EFROC), with some disagreement in the scientific literature regarding when thay are most appropriate.  Using utility theory, we showed how each of these studies can be justified by assuming different utility structures.  This leads to the rational choice of an observer performance study based on the needs of the imaging modality under consideration.\n\nWe believe that this project contributes to an ongoing effort to  incorporate the notion of outcome utilities into applied decision  making.  Our application is in radiology, but the appoach is valid for  any decision making process.  For example, one application we have investigated is  precision-recall curves for search engines.  This topic lends itself to a very similar mathematical treatment.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Craig K Abbey"
