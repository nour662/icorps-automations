This application is designed to provide a new approach to event creation, discovery and management among groups. It provides user-location and social-activity aware information to users.  By leveraging its end-to-end social mobile platform, users initiate activities and manage real-world attendance. Using the same system, businesses may engage with customers through direct and timely communications. \r\n\r\nThe project team plans to engage students in the research and development process.  The application is designed to allow a user?s current social activities and interests to be taken into account when presenting location-based information. This will enable the application to use user-mobility and locatability to connect local businesses with potentially interested individuals.",
