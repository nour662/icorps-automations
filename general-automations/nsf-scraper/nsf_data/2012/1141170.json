 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer science educators recognize that rapid advances in technology and the emergence of a global economy make it essential to national competitiveness to expose students from all disciplines to the ideas of computational thinking. Computational thinking includes a broad range of mental tools and concepts from computer science that empower specialists in all disciplines to more effectively adopt, use and develop computational tools to solve problems, design systems and understand human behavior. To adequately prepare a workforce for the changing economic and global landscape, the project is developing a model that enables students with diverse perspectives and disciplinary backgrounds to learn how to collaborate and integrate concepts from their respective fields to develop technology-based solutions for complex real-world problems. The model includes collaboration with a community partner, making it practical for the many campuses with community engaged learning curricula.\r\n\r\nThe approach is deeply rooted in the considerable research base on pedagogy in computer science, the liberal arts and journalism, as well as how students learn. The project is demonstrating how to adapt computer science and non-computer science courses, and is developing a suite of assessment instruments to measure outcomes for participants. The model is replicable for a wide range of computing-dependent disciplines and local community partners. Through multidisciplinary, collaborative and immersion experiences, undergraduate students better internalize how to take responsibility for engaged citizenship in a complex and diverse society, while advancing their critical, analytic and computational thinking.",

The goals for project were to formalize a model for courses that collaborate across disciplinary boundaries and with a community partner; create an experiential and engaging learning environment through which to immerse both computer science (CS) and non-CS majors in computational thinking (CT); to study the collaborative learning environment; and to articulate the processes, products, challenges and effective strategies that manifest collaborative problem solving.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span> </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The pilot project was a multi-semester study of the impact on student perceptions of their computational thinking abilities as a result of collaboration between students in CS and journalism courses to solve a problem for a community partner, Habitat for Humanity.

Computational thinking can be broadly defined as a way of solving problems that draws on concepts fundamental to CS.

In this study, undergraduate students in CS and journalism courses focused on creating a computational solution to address a real community need, and we investigated whether immersion in multidisciplinary collaborative experiences increases the computational thinking abilities of both CS and non-CS students.

The gains for the digital arts students outpaced those of the journalism students, however, journalism students expressed increased motivation to acquire more computing skills.

The collaboration thus had a positive impact on all students in terms of increasing their sense of local efficacy, but this impact was much stronger among CS students. While the model was designed to make computational thinking more attractive and relevant to people from underrepresented groups, there was not enough diversity by gender or race / ethnicity in these courses to determine whether the model had an impact.
