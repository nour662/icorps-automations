 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is increasing demand to deploy web applications across multiple data\r\ncenters to improve fault tolerance and reduce network delays to\r\nusers.  As application servers need to share data, their\r\nconstruction can be significantly simplified if a storage backend exists for\r\napplications to seamlessly access replicated data at different data centers.\r\n\r\nA geo-replicated storage system faces the unpleasant tradeoff of consistency\r\nvs. performance because of large inter-data-center communication delay.  This\r\nproposal investigates novel consistency and programming models for\r\ngeo-replicated storage that are easy-to-use and can achieve good performance.\r\nIn particular,  this project proposes parallel snapshot isolation, a novel \r\nconsistency model that enables efficient implementation with minimal\r\ncoordination across data centers.  Parallel snapshot isolation provides much\r\nstronger guarantees than existing weak consistency models by disallowing\r\nwrite-write conflicts and preserving the causality of operations.  The PI\r\nbuilds Walter, a geo-replicated transactional key-value store that guarantees\r\nparallel snapshot isolation.  A number of common web applications are written\r\non top of Walter and evaluations demonstrate that the new consistency model is\r\neasy to program for and enables applications to achieve high performance.  The\r\nsuccess of this project will bring much improvement to the state-of-art in\r\nwriting scalable and fault tolerant web applications.",
