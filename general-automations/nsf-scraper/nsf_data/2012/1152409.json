 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will optimize and pilot test the \r\npatent-pending Exogen system for the generation of biogas during wastewater \r\ntreatment. Based on a newly discovered process called electromethanogenesis, ExogenTM \r\nuses applied voltages and bio-electrodes to increase wastewater treatment rates and \r\nmethane fraction compared to competing fixed-film anaerobic digestion processes. Phase \r\nI R&D demonstrated (1) 30% - 50% increase in chemical oxygen demand removal rate, \r\n(2) 30%-60% increase in biogas production, (3) 5 - 18% increase in methane \r\nconcentrations with both artificial and real-world wastewater, resulting in a payback \r\nperiod of 1.7 - 3.7 years. Further benefits include reduction in start-up time and the \r\npotential for real-time automation via direct electrical feedback. During Phase II R&D \r\nCambrian Innovation will optimize the technology and build a scaled demonstration plant \r\nat a customer site \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to help alleviate the conflicting \r\ndemands for water and energy in the United States and across the industrialized world by \r\nenhancing the process of generating energy from wastewater treatment. Anaerobic \r\ndigestion can generate energy from wastewater. A recent AgSTAR report has highlighted \r\nthe potential for this technology in the U.S., identifying over 8,000 livestock facilities \r\nand numerous industrial sites suitable for the technology. Cambrian's ExogenTM platform \r\naims to decrease the costs and increase the benefit associated with deploying anaerobic \r\ndigestion in key industry segments, resulting in faster diffusion. Eventually the \r\ntechnology could open up new industries for anaerobic digestion processes. Exogen  \r\nfurther has the potential for carbon sequestration via the direct reduction of CO2 to CH4. \r\nAs such, ExogenTM technology offers a broad range of applications with significant \r\nsocietal benefit.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report for the General Public\n EcoVolt&reg;: Enhanced Anaerobic Digestion using Bio-electrodes\n NSF Phase II Award:  1152409\n June 29, 2015\n\nCambrian Innovation has successfully completed Phase II and Phase IIB SBIR research under award number 1152409 entitled: EcoVolt&reg;: Enhanced Anaerobic Digestion using Bio-electrodes.  The purpose of the project was to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel anaerobic wastewater treatment process to produce renewable biogas while simultaneously treating high levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) found in industrial wastewater.  EcoVolt&reg; technology leverages biologically-catalyzed electrochemical reactions at electrodes. At the anode, microbes consume pollutants comprising BOD while generating an electrical current; at the cathode, different microbes utilize the electrical current along with carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions to form a high methane-fraction biogas.\n\nThe Phase II project built upon Phase I results, demonstrating the proof of principle of this wastewater treatment concept.  Phase II laboratory experiments focused on evaluating and optimizing the components, operational conditions, and treatment system architecture.  Phase II concluded with pilot testing of the technology in the field on an actual industrial wastewater stream.  Phase IIB efforts focused on demonstrating the system in the field at an industrial scale.  Cambrian Innovation tested the system for a period of 16 months at a Sonoma County winery.  The demonstration treatment system exceeded target performance objectives under dramatically fluctuating wastewater loading characteristics.\n\nAs a direct result of research under this Award, Cambrian Innovation has officially launched the EcoVolt&reg; product line for sale to industrial customers in the food and beverage market.  This unique product offering is the first commercially available wastewater treatment system to feature bio-electrochemical technology.  The EcoVolt&reg; product is a modular, containerized, energy-positive wastewater treatment system designed for stable, automated operation.  A typical installation is a turn-key solution which includes: a headworks unit for pre-treatment of the wastewater stream, EcoVolt&reg; reactor modules for BOD removal and biogas production, and a combined heat and power (CHP) system to covert the biogas into usable heat and electricity for the customer facility.  EcoVolt&reg; has been enthusiastically received in the market and full-scale commercial installations are already operational at customer facilities.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew R Silver"
