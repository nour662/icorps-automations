 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes a robotic hand based on a novel\r\ntorque-switching mechanism and patented miniature motor controllers. The mechanism actively channels\r\nmotor torque along different transmission paths and enables dependant and independent (time-discreet)\r\ncontrol of both finger joints in a robotic hand to perform both power and pinch grasps. There is a growing\r\nneed in industry for adaptable and flexible manufacturing capabilities in a dynamic environment. Industry\r\ngenerally uses single-axis grippers and end-effectors that are modified to pick up specific items in a\r\nhighly-controlled environment. This requires exchanging multiple customized and expensive grippers via\r\ntool-changers. This project?s goal is to produce a paradigm shift in the materials-handling industry by\r\nintroducing a highly flexible, affordable, and lightweight robotic gripper that can grasp and manipulate\r\nobjects of varying size, shape, and stiffness. The Phase-II project objectives are to design and develop a\r\nprototype 3-fingered gripper using a novel torque-switching mechanism, optimized motors, multiple\r\nfeedback sensors, and miniature control electronics, and to test and evaluate the prototype gripper in an\r\nindustrial setting. This program will result in a compact, lightweight, and affordable robotic hand capable\r\nof grasping and manipulating a large range of objects.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project addresses the shortcomings of gripper devices\r\navailable today which discourage the use of robotic systems, thereby undermining manufacturing\r\nproductivity. The proposed solution improves manufacturing competitiveness by enabling easier adoption\r\nof robotic work cells in conventional markets such as light manufacturing and emerging markets such as\r\nthe food and beverage industry. The societal impact will be felt in the field of education where robotics is\r\nrecognized as a strategic motivator for children and young adults to enter into technical fields. Most\r\nrobots are too large and dangerous to bring into a classroom. The proposed robotic hand will be very\r\nportable, safe, and exciting for both educators and students. A significant increase in gripper dexterity will make it an even more attractive motivator in the classroom and other secondary educational programs and\r\nworkshops. A potential secondary application for this innovation is a more dexterous and lightweight\r\nhand prosthesis which could have a major societal impact. Finally, the ability to transmit torque through\r\ndifferent paths in a miniature package and allow control of different functions with a single small actuator\r\nenables lightweight yet versatile machines and could have impacts beyond the field of robotics.",
