 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work as an International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) Young Summer Scientist Program (YSSP) participant would augment recent studies by quantifying future power plant emissions from anticipated hotter summer conditions in India. The overarching goal of this work is to determine populations in India most exposed to air pollution-related health risks in 2030.\r\n \r\nThe proposed research will advance knowledge by linking energy use, air quality, and health impact data in a creative way. Expected results include estimations of relative risk of adverse health outcomes due to exacerbated air pollution levels, which will help inform future energy, climate, and health policies. The YSSP participant will work with researchers at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis to disseminate research results with the aim of improving climate, energy, and health intervention strategies. Risk estimates will also be placed in the larger context of air pollution policy to estimate an optimal emissions scenario balancing economic needs and health concerns. \r\n\r\nThe expected results from this research have clear benefits as broader impacts to society: risk estimates will inform currently unaddressed consequences of energy use. As urban expansion continues, the results will improve energy use and health intervention planning by highlighting air pollution risks. In addition to conducting this research with targeted policy applications, the YSSP participant will engage with the university community after his return from IIASA to further the reach of the project.  The YSSP participant plans to work with his advisor on a teaching module demonstrating how energy production, climate, air quality, and human health are linked for a course on Health Impact Assessment of Global Environmental Change.  The YSSP participant is also a member of a National Science Foundation Integrated Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program which promotes sustainability and vulnerability research across disciplines (Humans and the Global Environment, CHANGE). The Young Scientists Summer Program at IIASA will allow him to undertake interdisciplinary work and capitalize on the communication and leadership skills gained through the IGERT experience.",
