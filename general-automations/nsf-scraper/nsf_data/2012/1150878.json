 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches:\r\nThe research objective is to create a silicon-based multijunction solar cell device with integrated photoelectrochemical capability, resulting in a high-efficiency, robust, and easily manufacturable device capable of converting sunlight into storable chemical energy. A systematic approach toward device optimization will be implemented, combining simulation, device fabrication, and hierarchical nanoscale characterization.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis project seeks to leverage the inherent advantages of silicon for photovoltaic applications (reliability, scalability, performance, manufacturability, over 60 years of accumulated R&D) while overcoming its inherent disadvantages (high cost, low efficiency, intermittency). Collaborations between the PI?s PV-focused group and catalysis experts will ensure rapid interdisciplinary progress. \r\n\r\nScientific challenges will be addressed in a systematic fashion: (1) High-performance sub-devices (individual solar cells) will be created; (2) Sub-devices will be integrated into a single high-performance silicon-based multijunction cell; (3) Aforementioned devices will be integrated with catalyst materials. The envisioned result is a silicon-based multijunction device capable of direct solar-to-fuels conversion.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis project addresses five critical needs enabling utility-scale implementation of solar energy conversion: low cost, high efficiency, non-intermittency (dispatchability), scalability, and domestic manufacturability. Close interaction with local companies will ensure expedient technology transfer and student internship opportunities. Outreach efforts will improve solar energy education via augmenting a university course, engaging the general public at local museums and interactive websites, and educating future thought leaders. Underrepresented minorities will be engaged in solar energy research and engineering through an active mentorship program.",
