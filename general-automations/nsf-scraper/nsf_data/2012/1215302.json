 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to be able to replace human agents with\r\nartificial agents in studying two-player games. This project, if\r\nsuccessful, will greatly enhance the ability of economists to test\r\neconomic theories by partially replacing laboratory experiments with\r\nsimulations. Over the last decades laboratory studies have proven\r\ninvaluable both for the validation (and invalidation) of economic\r\ntheories, and for the practical purpose of testing mechanisms (such as\r\nauctions) in the laboratory prior to practical implementation. The\r\nability to use simulations with artificial agents in place of\r\nlaboratory experiments with live human beings will both reduce the\r\ncost of validation and testing, and make it possible to explore\r\nquickly a much wider range of theories and policy alternatives. It\r\nwill also enhance our understanding of human behavior and enrich our\r\nknowledge of the connection between human and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nAgent-based modeling is an emerging and attractive approach to\r\nvalidating economic theories. Existing research has focused on simple\r\nand naive agents. This project proposes as the next step to develop\r\nartificial human (economic) agents capable of mimicking the behavior\r\nof human laboratory subjects in the context of two player simultaneous\r\nmove games. Substantial and detailed data is available on human play\r\nunder these conditions. Existing algorithms fall only slightly short\r\nof the ability to mimic human play but do not yet implement fully\r\nautonomous agents. Based on hidden Markov models, the PIs propose to\r\ndevelop and investigate a framework of belief learning that is broad\r\nenough to encompass many existing learning algorithms including\r\nreinforcement learning, fictitious play, and smooth fictitious play.\r\nMoreover, based on this framework, the PIs propose to derive more\r\nsophisticated learning methods to fully develop artificial agents. This\r\nresearch will pursue two important directions. First, the PIs will\r\nintroduce the initial calibration of priors based on available\r\ninformation and a cognitive hierarchy model. Second, the PIs will allow for\r\nthe reconsideration of the existing model when \"surprises\" occur. The\r\nproject will lead to the next stage of research in both economics and\r\ncomputer science in broadening the class of artificial agents to\r\nattack broader and more economically important tasks. It will also\r\nenrich the research on graphical model learning for artificial\r\nintelligence.",
