 "awd_abstract_narration": "Markov chain simulation is a very general technique applied to a wide spectrum of problems in the physical sciences.  From explicit simulations of physical and dynamical processes, such as fluid dynamics and spin systems, to algorithms for sampling from probability distributions over enormous sets of combinatorial objects, Markov chains are ubiquitous.  This project will seek to improve the design and analysis of such algorithms, leading to faster running times.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the performance of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm involves proving bounds on how quickly it approaches its limiting, or \"stationary\", distribution.  Due to the inherent randomness in any Markov chain simulation, there is often no reliable empirical criterion for measuring this convergence; rather, one must rely on theoretical guarantees. The PI will focus on the twin long-standing problems of how to redesign Markov chains to actually converge faster, and of proving better convergence guarantees, both of which allow us to safely terminate MCMC simulations sooner. Over the course of this work, these goals will be approached using techniques from three main thematic groupings:\r\n\r\n1.  In the \"Coupling Method\" for proving convergence bounds, one seeks to show that two copies of a Markov chain can be \"made to approach each other\" under some metric on the state space.  To improve this kind of analysis, the PI seeks to find better metrics, i.e., better definitions of the distance between two states.\r\n\r\n2.  Several different mathematical notions of duality have played important roles in the analysis of Markov chains.  For example, the duality between the spin system and the cluster characterization of the Ising model, a standard model of magnetic materials, the high-temperature/low-temperature duality for the Potts model on a planar graph, and strong stationary duality, which underlies a recently introduced technique called the Evolving Sets method.\r\n\r\n3. The PI will attempt to convert reversible Markov chains into non-reversible \"lifted\" Markov chains, by adding additional \"momentum\" information to the states.  These lifted chains allow sampling from the original distribution, but can run quadratically faster.\r\n\r\nThe project will include the creation and deployment of a free web resource, \"Markov Chains Central,\" which will include a collection of new and existing laboratory applets for simulating and experimenting with Markov chains and various measures of convergence. These applets will help students visualize Markov chains and understand them through experimentation and play. The project also features an integrated educational plan, which provides for wide dissemination of generated knowledge and educational materials. This work will support undergraduate and graduate student research and mentoring. Effort will be made to maximize involvement of women and minority students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the course of this project, progress was made on a number of research objectives, some directly related to the project objectives,and some inspired by them indirectly.  Funds were primarily used to support graduate students with Research Assistantships and to pay summer salary for the PI, but also to pay for travel to conferences and research meetings, and for computer equipment.\n\nWe investigated fast parallel algorithms for generating random configurations from spin systems.  We assumed that the parallel processors are connected in the same pattern as the spin system.  Although this work is theoretical, it is of interest because the running time needed can be exponentially less than in the non-parallel setting.  It is also interesting because it applies to a fairly broad class of spin systems, including important examples such as graph coloring and independent sets.\n\nWe investigated the use of non-reversible liftings of Markov chains to speed up their mixing times.  This technique can potentially speed up the mixing time as much as quadratically.  However, it remains very difficult to design and analyze such liftings.  Our progress was in the special case when the state space has a linear, or path, topology, in which case we are able to match a known conductance lower bound.\n\nWe made advances on a number of problems related to spatial mixing and mixing time for graph colorings.  Our main goal here is to prove that this spin systembehaves well for fewer colors than current rigorous results have established.  We have been able to get improved results for random graphs, trees, and graphs with many triangles.  New techniques developed in these works seem likely to have applications to other spin systems besides graph colorings.\n\nRelated progress inspired by the project objectives included developing improved algorithms for networks of distributed agents trying to communicate and do computations in the presence of adversarial noise, algorithms for a model of energy-aware computation on distributed radio networks, and achieving a better understanding of the properties of random geometric graphs.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas Hayes"
