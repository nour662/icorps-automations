Together they constitute a potential solution to the global energy crisis and at the same time can reduce carbon emission due to the use of fossil fuels. A photoelectrochemical  (PEC) cell utilizes solar energy to directly split water and generate hydrogen, which is clean and free of carbon emission. However, it is broadly recognized by the PEC community that there is no single material that can be the perfect photoelectrode candidate for solar water splitting with respect to light absorption, water reduction, chemical stability, etc. This project will investigate  the use of three-dimensional  (3-D) tree-like branched  nanowire  heterostructures from earth abundant materials by low-cost fabrication process as photoelectrodes  for high efficiency and potentially,  a  practical  and  sustainable  clean  hydrogen  generation.  The array of  the  tree-like  3-D branched nanowires offers a unique combination  of desired properties that are critical to high efficiency PEC hydrogen generation, including enhanced light absorption, improved charge separation/collection, enlarged surface area, and better electrochemical reaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed research focus will be on (i) design and fabrication of the 3-D nanostructured photoelectrodes using earth abundant materials (Si, Cu2O, Fe2O3, etc.)  by  low-cost  solution  processes,  (ii)  understanding  of  the  interface between   the  nanowire   core  and  branches   and  their   effect   on  separation   and  transport   of  the photogenerated  charge carriers, and (iii) understanding of the electrolyte/nanowire  interface, in particular the surface electrochemical reaction/corrosion of semiconductor electrodes at high local acidic/basic conditions. Chemically robust materials such as TiO2 and WO3 will also be studied.  The research will develop an understanding of the fundamental materials science and chemistry questions regarding heterojunctions   formation  in  nanomaterials   and  interfaces,   as  well  as  create  a  new  paradigm  of heterogeneous functional integration at nanoscale. Specifically with regard to renewable energy research, this work will also shine a light on design and fabrication/manufacturing of high-efficiency photovoltaic devices and H2 generation.  In addition, the project will provide opportunity to the undergraduate and graduate students to obtain training in the interdisciplinary areas related to this project.",
