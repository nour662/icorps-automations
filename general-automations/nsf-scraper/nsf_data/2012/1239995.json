 "awd_abstract_narration": "Xavier University's Robert Noyce Scholarship Program is focusing on attracting community service-oriented science, computer science, and mathematics students to careers in high school teaching.  Xavier is creating opportunities, including tutoring and summer internships, for science, computer science, and mathematics majors to teach science, technology and mathematics content to underserved, urban students.  It is also enhancing Xavier's education program by revising the required introductory education course to incorporate theories related to asset-based community development including experiential learning and neighborhood tours.  Xavier's Noyce program is providing three points of entry to accommodate varying decision-making processes:  the beginning of students' junior or senior year or in their first year after graduation.  Fifteen undergraduate science, computer science, and mathematics majors are being awarded $20,000 scholarships for two years and eight graduate students are receiving $20,000 stipends for one full-time year of licensure courses.  The project is investigating how service experiences can encourage science, computer science, and mathematics majors to consider teaching, and whether students who are attracted to teaching because of a personal commitment to service are more likely to be successful in high-need districts and stay in these school environments for longer periods.  It is also considering what curricular supports make education licensure courses and field work relevant to students motivated by a commitment to community engagement, and what supports enable new science, computer science, and mathematics teachers to be successful in high needs districts.  By 2017, the program will have increased the number of Xavier students attaining science, computer science, and mathematics teaching licensure by 52%, helping to address critical shortages of teachers of these subjects in Ohio and Kentucky.",
