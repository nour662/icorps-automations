The\r\nsite exposes students to a range of topics in Computer Science, including\r\npen-based computing, computer-supported cooperative work, assistive\r\ntechnology, natural language processing, functional programming\r\nlanguages, wireless sensor networks, programming pedagogy, parallel\r\nprogramming, and virtual reality. Students will work in small teams\r\nwith a mentor and will experience conducting research as part of a team,\r\ndisseminating research results, and participating in a community of\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\nThis REU site will allow 24 students (over three years) to experience\r\nresearch in a variety of areas in Computer Science.  The site focuses\r\non recruiting students from undergraduate-only institutions, who do not\r\nhave as ready access to research opportunities as students at research\r\nuniversities.  The site?s primary objective is to encourage talented\r\nstudents enrolled at undergraduate institutions to pursue graduate\r\nstudies and research careers in Computer Science.",
