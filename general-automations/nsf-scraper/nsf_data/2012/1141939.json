 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antarctic clouds constitute an important parameter of the surface radiation budget and thus play a significant role in Antarctic climate and climate change. The variability in, and long term trends of, cloud optical and microphysical properties are therefore fundamental in parameterizing the mixed phase (water-snow-ice) coastal Antarctic stratiform clouds experienced around the continent.\r\n\r\nUsing a spectoradiometer that covers the wavelength range of 350 to 2200nm, the downwelled spectral irradiance at the earth surface (Ross Island) will be used to retrieve the optical depth, thermodynamic phase, liquid water droplet effective radius, and ice-cloud effective particle size of overhead clouds, at hourly intervals and for an austral  summer season (Oct-March).  Based on the very limited data sets that exist for the maritime Antarctic, expectations are that Ross Island (Lat 78 S) should exhibit clouds with:\r\na)\tAn abundance of supercooled liquid water, and related mixed-phase cloud processes\r\nb)\tCloud nucleation from year round biogenic and oceanic sources, in an otherwise pristine environment\r\nc)\tSimple cloud geometries of predominantly stratiform cloud decks\r\n\r\nIncreased understanding of the cloud properties in the region of the main USAP base, McMurdo station is also relevant to operational weather forecasting  relevant to aviation. A range of educational and outreach activities are associate with the project, including provision of workshops for high school teachers will be carried out.",

Interpretation of Spectral Irradiance Data\n\nWe demonstrated how shortwave spectral irradiance data could improve understanding of Antarctic cloud microphysics in a set of case studies under contrasting meteorological conditions influencing Ross Island (Scott and Lubin 2014). In our case studies we find that cloud systems arriving at Ross Island after transiting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and Ross Ice Shelf (RIS) are radiatively dominated by the ice phase.

Deep cyclonic disturbances over the Ross Sea are seen to be limited in their ability to deliver significant moisture as far south as Ross Island, and in this case most cloud are optically thin.\n\n3. Unique Regime of Antarctic Cloud Microphysics\n\nIn Scott and Lubin (2014) we realized that the ice phase is associated with movement of air masses over varying terrain elevation. We then investigated whether the high Antarctic terrain provides a contrast in cloud microphysics with the high Arctic (where most polar atmospheric research has taken place). We compared Ross Island with two well-instrumented Arctic field sites: Barrow Alaska (site of the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program; ARM) and Summit, Greenland (site of the Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric State and Precipitation at Summit, or ICECAPS program). We examined NASA CloudSat and CALIPSO data comparing seasonal variability in microphysical and radiative cloud properties at these three sites, and confirmed that Antarctic orographic lifting provides a strong contrast with the Arctic (Scott and Lubin, 2016).\n\n4. Surface Radiation Budget of the WAIS\n\nWith the experience gained from the two above efforts, SIO graduate student researcher Ryan Scott further analyzed NASA remote sensing data and also incorporated broadband radiation measurements from the joint NSF- and DOE-supported ARM West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE). Here Mr. Scott collaborated with NASA Langley Research Center and Brookhaven National Laboratory (Scott et al. 2017).

SIO?s contribution to SSI involves providing professional development to prepare science teachers countywide to teach to the recently adopted (in CA) Next Generation Science and Engineering Standards (NGSS).
