 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal objective is to invent new approaches for manipulating quantum systems to enhance their nonlinear-optical response.  Rather than studying specific systems, this work seeks to discover universal properties that are key to optimizing a material for a given task, which may identify altogether new and transformative materials paradigms and applications.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is in the development of fundamental quantum mechanical concepts that build an understanding of the performance limit of optical materials and practical methods for attaining the limit.  The fundamental knowledge gained will guide chemists and nanotechnologists in designing new materials and nanostrucutures, provide new paradigms to physicists/materials scientists for making novel functional materials, and generate ideas for engineers to develop novel devices.\r\nThe broader impacts are diverse by virtue of the generality of the approach, which is based on sum rules that apply to all materials that interact with light including organic molecules, inorganic crystals, nanoparticles, smart materials, nanowires, etc. For example, medical imaging and diagnostics based on selective two-photon absorption would be made more efficient with better tagging chromophores.  Other applications of this project include ultra fast switching for telecommunications, logic elements for computing, light-emitting materials for displays, and 3D photolithographic materials for optical memory.  In addition to visits to local schools, online interactive resources will be developed to disseminate information to high-school and undergraduate-level students; and, numerical code that is developed as part of our work will be distributed over the web so that students can participate in publishable research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nElectronics has transformed our lives, giving us access to a wealth of information and the computing power to transform this information into cures for diseases and new technologies that enhance our lives.  Photonics, which replaces electricity with light, provides the next leap.  It can rev up the speed and capacity of computers; supercharge the internet; provide ultrasensitive medical imaging technologies and noninvasive cancer therapies.  These kinds of advances require materials that mediate the interactions between beams of light.\n\n \n\nMost materials development programs essentially rely on intuition and trial and error.  As a result, nonlinear-optical materials improvement has stagnated, with only incremental changes in efficiency.  A fresh approach is needed to develop new paradigms for making matter.  To do so requires that a method be developed for assessing how far present materials fall short of what is possible.  To that end, fundamental guiding principles need to be discovered that will guide materials improvement by defining the critical parameters that need to be adjusted.\n\n \n\nOur research has developed a new fundamental understanding of the limits of the nonlinear-optical response and used it to define new paradigms for making more efficient device materials.  These new approaches can be used to make molecules better and they provide guidelines for fabricating artificial quantum systems with enhanced nonlinear-optical responses.  In particular, we have found that geometry (shape), topology (how the pieces are connected), and interactions between atomistic units (such as nanoparticles, hybrid molecule/quantum wire composites, and quantum graphs) profoundly influence the linear and nonlinear-optical properties.  Furthermore, to address device requirements, we have defined a material figure of merit (FOM) that quantifies the combined properties of optical nonlinearity along with other requirements, such as low optical, which can be optimized from quantum principles to determine how to make the best materials for a given application.  These results will guide researchers and nanotechnologists in making materials that are optimized for particular applications, give insights into nonlinear-optical phenomena and provide fabrication recipes for enabling new devices.\n\n \n\nThese results were obtained using Monte Carlo studies, which broadly sample all possible quantum systems to identify the most important properties in making an optimized material.  One novel structure found is a composite that combines a molecule with a metal nanorod.  While a large body of literature can be found on each of these, our work has determined how the two pieces need to be combined in the most optimal manner.\n\n \n\n(1) Intellectual Merit:  This proposal has applied fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics to build an understanding of the performance limit of optical materials.  In addition to contributing to insights into the fundamental Physics of light-matter interactions and investigating the types of questions that are answerable from the axioms of quantum mechanics, the practical results will guide chemists and nanotechnologists in designing new composite materials, provide new paradigms for physicists/materials scientists in making new structures, and give engineers new ideas for developing novel devices.  It should be stressed that our approach applies to all materials, impacting the design of organic molecules, nanostructures, and inorganic materials.\n\n \n\n(2) Broader impact: While the proposed focus is on photonic devices, the guidelines developed here for making optical materials can be used in any application that depends on nonlinear interaction between light and a quantum system, be it a nanostructure or a molecule.  For example, one type of cancer treatment works by tagging a tumor with two-photon absorbing chromophores that preferentially bind to the tumor.  A laser beam deposits energy into the chromophores thus burning the tum..."
