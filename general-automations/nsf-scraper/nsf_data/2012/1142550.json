 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to eliminate the use of heat during the process of spray drying liquid emulsions into powders. Typically, a liquid emulsion consists of a high-value liquid ingredient emulsified with a carrier system that when dried captures the liquid ingredient in a powdered form.  Traditional spray drying employs air heated up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit to dry the liquids into powders. However, exposing sensitive, volatile liquid ingredients to high temperatures causes molecular degradation that negatively impacts performance.  By eliminating the use of heat, it is expected that the quality, solubility, stability and overall performance of powders will be significantly improved. This project will focus on designing novel drying equipment, formulating emulsions, and reducing moisture content in the finished powders.  \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide an innovative, commercially viable no-heat spray drying technology with the ability to manufacture significant amounts of powdered products for applications in foods, chemicals, probiotics and pharmaceuticals where the production of a free-flowing powder is required. This no-heat spray drying process is anticipated to improve shelf life, create better solubility, reduce costs and deliver a more efficacious product, enabling liquid quality flavors and ingredients in a powder form.",

The Phase I/Ib research primarily focused on improving our DriZoomTM technology as we continue to scale and commercialize our technology.  This research has significantly improved upon our innovative, commercially viable \u00e6no heat\u00c6 spray drying technology by furthering our ability to manufacture significant amounts of powdered products.
