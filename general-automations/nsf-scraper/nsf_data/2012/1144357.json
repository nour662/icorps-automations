 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award facilitates scientific research using the large new computational resource named Blue Waters scheduled to be deployed at the University of Illinois in 2012. It provides travel funds to support technical coordination between the principal investigators, the Blue Waters project team and vendor technical team.\r\n\r\nThe Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm for structure formation has had many successes over a large range of scales: from Cosmic Microwave Background fluctuations on the scale of the horizon to the formation and clustering of individual galaxies. However, at the low end of the galaxy luminosity function, the agreement between the CDM theory and observations is somewhat at odds. In particular, the existence of bulgeless, cored small galaxies is not a natural prediction of CDM. However, these are the scales where the baryonic physics of gas cooling, star formation and feedback can significantly impact the overall mass of the galaxy. Furthermore, accurately modeling the star formation process requires spatial resolution of order 100 parsecs or less and mass resolutions of less than 10000 solar masses in order to resolve the molecular star forming regions of the interstellar medium.  The planned simulations  will use the Blue Waters petascale system to model space telescope survey volumes consistent with addresssing small galaxies from high redshift to the present with sufficient resolution to make robust predictions of the luminosity function, star formation rate and morphologies appropriate for these surveys.\r\n\r\nStudents will be involved in these computational advances in cosmology research.  The project team is successful in attracting a diverse population of students.  Morever, the simulations will be represented visually in public outreach forums as well as in instruction in undergraduate courses, increasing public understanding of galaxy and star formation which is fundamental to our knowledge of the Universe as a whole.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding the origins of galaxies like our own Milky Way requires\nthe modeling of physics on a vast range of scales.  The majority of\nthe matter is dark (that is, only interacts gravitationally) and its\naccumulation and distribution within a galaxy depends on structure on\nthe largest scales.   Galaxies themselves are quite small compared this\nlarge scale structure (see image).\n\nWhile the visible components are a minority of the mass, they have\nsignificant influence on the evolution of the Universe, and certainly\non how we can observe the Universe.  Therefore it is important for\nmodels of the formation of galaxies match both the sizes of galaxies\ntoday, and the observations of galaxies in the early Universe, such as\nthose made by the Hubble Space Telescope.  In this project we have\ndemonstrated that we can build models that satisfy these requirements,\nbut only at significant computational cost and using the largest\nsupercomputers available (such as the NSF Blue Waters sustained\npetascale computiing facility.)\n\nThese sophisticated models help us understand processes in the\nUniverse that would be otherwise hard to address.  For instance, we\nknow that most of the volume of the Universe is filled with a very low\ndensity, very hot plasma, (the Inter-Galactic Medium) but we don't\nknow how that plasma came to be so hot.  Our models show that,\nsomewhat counter-intuitively, radiation from the stars in the smallest\ngalaxies are sufficient to heat the IGM to its current state.  This is\nbecause our models predict there are a large number of small galaxies\n(which we predict will be discovered by future telescopes, such as the\nJames Webb Space Telescope), and that the radiation more easily escapes\nthese small galaxies.\n\nThe fascination of this subject has attracted many good students both\nat the Graduate and Undergraduate level to work on the simulation\nresults.  The work performed in analyzing these simulations was a\nsignificant part of two Ph. D. theses at the University of\nWashington.  Five undergraduate students participated in the analysis\nof these simulations, particularly in comparing the simulated galaxies\nto real galaxies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/08/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas R Quinn"
