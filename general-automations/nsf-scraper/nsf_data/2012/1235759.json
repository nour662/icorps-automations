The major difficulties in predicting such a complex flow include: (1) roughness of the spreading surface, (2) chemical reactions between the liquid/melt and the substrate, and, (3) inadequate models of the physical mechanism by which the triple line (a locus of points where solid, liquid and vapor/gas meet) propagates.  This project will integrate experimental and modeling strategy through: (i) experiments on characterized virgin and designed surfaces, with in situ monitoring and measurements of the triple line motion, (ii) advances in theory and modeling based on the diffuse interface (phase-field) models, capable of representing propagation of phase- and chemical reaction fronts, as well as the diffusive nature of the triple line motion, and, (iii) integration of modeling and experiments.  Real time in situ monitoring of the spreading at the micro scale around the triple line will be the source of data on kinetics of the liquid front propagation.  To achieve projects objectives, the phase-field modeling for reactive and non-reactive spreading will be implemented within a versatile computational finite element framework, thus enabling studies of variety of problems with different geometries.  The major experimental challenges are related to the fast evolution of the triple line and the presence of reactive substrates.  The required time resolution will be achieved by developing hot stage microscopy techniques for in situ monitoring of the moving liquid front and the dynamics of the contact angle.  Suppression of a chemical reaction will be accomplished by formation of intermetallics prior to spreading of a liquid metal.  The major modeling challenges include: (a) implementation of the surface diffusion kinetics governing the motion of the triple line for the non-reactive model into the finite element framework to model rough surfaces, and, (b) implementation of the combined liquid-gas phase-field and the chemical reaction phase-field into the finite element framework.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this investigation will be felt in a broad set of applications, related to industrial and natural processes.  The transformative nature of the research is that it will results in the ability to effectively control wetting by surface alterations and the selection of liquid system and solid substrates.  This will enable rational design of industrial processes which depend on liquid spreading, and products whose function depends on wetting.",
