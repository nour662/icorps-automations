The Moriond meetings in 2012 are transitional since, besides experimental results to be reported from U.S.-based CDF, D0, PHENIX and STAR, new results will be presented from the extensive running of the LHC Experiments (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb) in which the U.S. scientists play a major role.  Moriond remains a unique and excellent opportunity to both advertise the impressive U.S. science program in particle physics and at the same time to give our most talented young scientists extra visibility by allowing them to deliver their latest results at these two major European forums. Special efforts will be made to encourage women and minorities to participate.",
