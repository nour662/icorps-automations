Enzymes are fully recyclable catalytic proteins that frequently display exquisite chemo-, enantio- and regioselectivity and operate under mild conditions of pH and temperature.  These characteristics make enzymes cost effective and sustainable catalysts for a wide range of chemical transformations.  Modern tools of protein discovery, design and engineering aid the development of novel biocatalysts and their tailor-designed integration into industrial processes.  Consequently, biocatalysts have applications to the production of pharmaceutical intermediates, novel materials and diagnostics, as well as fine, performance and agro-chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe proposal requests support for the twelfth biennial Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Biocatalysis.  The conference will take place at Bryant University, in Smithfield, Rhode Island on July 8-13, 2012.  The meeting will be preceded by the first associated Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) on July 7-8, 2012.  Together, these meetings will bring together graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and leaders of the field to discuss the latest scientific and technological advances in biocatalysis from the research bench to the industrial production plant. Topics include: \r\n\r\n- synthetic biology in biocatalysis\r\n- design and engineering of biocatalysts\r\n- cascade reaction systems\r\n- design and engineering of processes\r\n- academic and industrial trends in biocatalysis\r\n- biocatalysis in synthesis\r\n- industrial biocatalysis\r\n- future challenges in green chemistry \r\n\r\nIn an effort to better facilitate scientific exchange between graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, the co-chairs of the GRC have established a research seminar where the young scientists will present their research findings and discuss potential future implications of their work.  Participation by early career researchers will add significant value to this conference and will foster communications among current and future leaders in the field.  The small, highly interactive setting helps foster intellectual discourse, networking, and collaborations.",
