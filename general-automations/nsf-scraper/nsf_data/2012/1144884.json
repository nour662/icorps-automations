 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the influence of solar wind conditions on isolated high-latitude transpolar arcs (also known as theta aurora) and determine the local and global plasma flows in the ionosphere associated with the arcs. The project will examine the electrodynamic characteristics of the transpolar arcs and relate them to the corresponding A total of 87 events where Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F13 satellite has measured precipitating charged particles associated with transpolar arcs.  The satellite measurements will be used to determine: (1) the spatial extent of the precipitating particle regions, (2) the electrostatic potential distribution, (3) the cross-track (sunward/antisunward) horizontal ionospheric plasma flow, (4) precipitating ion and electron average energies and fluxes, and (5) field-aligned currents. In addition to the satellite measurements, data from the Super dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) will be used to determine the details of the ionospheric convection pattern associated with the transpolar arcs. \r\n\r\nThis project will examine the energy coupling between the solar wind, Earth's magnetosphere, and the ionosphere during periods when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is pointing northward.  During northward IMF, auroral arcs often form and divide the polar cap into two apparently separate regions.  The project seeks to understand the nature of the electromagnetic coupling of the different regions and how they evolve.",
