The project, called Explore Emerging\r\nComputing in Science and Engineering (EXERCISE), exposes students to\r\nemerging parallel programming models, such as GPGPU languages and MapReduce,\r\napplied to compute intensive problems in computer networks, image and signal\r\nprocessing, and geographic information system.\r\n\r\nThe project will provide an opportunity for twenty-four undergraduate\r\nstudents over a three-year period to participate in a supportive environment\r\nthat encourages them to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science.  It will\r\nexpose these students to parallel programming, which is an area of growing\r\nimportance, and offer them the opportunity to present their results at\r\nregional and national professional conferences.  The site will recruit\r\nparticipants from under-represented groups.",
