 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's request funding for an ocean observation Research Coordination Network (RCN:OceanObsNetwork). The goal of the RCN is to foster a broad, multi-disciplinary dialogue, enabling more effective use of ocean observatories and observing systems consistent with national and international efforts. The major RCN activities are: increasing observing systems sustainability; stimulating inter-disciplinary cooperation; facilitating open data exchange; promoting interoperability; improving the flow of information to key stakeholders; and expanding effective capacity building. The proposed RCN will be the seed for a long-term, sustainable international forum on observatories for scientists and users of ocean information.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:     \r\n\r\nThis effort will encourage new partnerships, provide for new and innovative research outcomes and provide younger scientists with opportunities to lead technical task teams under senior Network mentors and facilitate both technical and leadership capacity building in under-represented groups. An emphasis on interoperability and exchange of data will both allow closer cooperation between observatories and also support improved global modeling. Interfacing with end users of information, whether in the government, academia or industry, will increase use of data, providing more visible impacts of observatories and ocean observing systems. Observatories are major investments and broadening the user community will help long-term sustainability of the systems.",
