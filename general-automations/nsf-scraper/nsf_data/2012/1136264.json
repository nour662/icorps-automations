 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee proposes two studies to examine attrition and persistence in engineering careers.  Study 1 extends Fouad and Singh's previous work on women engineering alumnae from 30 universities to male engineering alumni from the same universities, using a web-based survey, allowing comparison of attrition decisions between male and female engineers with the same educational preparation. The survey will use a modified Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) model to assess three domains of self-efficacy, three domains of outcome expectations, interests, workplace supports and barriers, job attitudes (satisfaction and commitment), cognitive and psychological withdrawal, and intentions of leaving the career or profession. Study 2 will focus on only those men and women engineers who are currently working in engineering to identify factors that influence their decisions to stay in engineering, and differences in how men and women become embedded in their careers. Job Embeddedness (JE) theory will be incorporated into the modified SCCT model as a moderator of intentions to leave. Study 2 will also use a web-based survey with members of professional engineering societies to examine self efficacy, workplace supports and barriers, job attitudes (satisfaction and commitment), job embeddedness, work engagement, cognitive and psychological withdrawal, and intentions of leaving the career or profession. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The results will offer important new insights into the distinctive and specific needs of both men and women engineers that can help organizations in designing effective career development and other work-life programs that will aid their retention efforts. Specific recommendations will be developed that will help engineers feel more connected to their profession as engineers and to their organization, thereby aiding their retention in the profession. In addition, such interventions could enhance multiple types of efficacy, job and career satisfaction, and minimize withdrawal cognitions, thereby potentially altering the trajectory of departure choices. The findings may also be used to identify strategic decision points and career stages at which interventions need to be tailored and specifically targeted to increase retention in engineering careers. The findings will also have practical guidance to educational institutions to help them better prepare students for engineering careers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project had two studies:\n\n Study 1:  Using the expanded Social Cognitive Career Model as the theoretical base, Study 1 investigated gender differences in factors related to men?s decisions to leave or stay in engineering.  In Study 1, we were able to partner with 16 universities to recruit their male alumni in engineering bachelor's programs.  Over 6600 men responded, with 4622 completing the survey.  Of those, 486 (11%) graduated but did not enter the field, 1,889 left the field of engineering and 2, 247 were currently engineers.  We asked men who left reasons for leaving, as well as assessed various  factors that predicted their intentions to stay or leave engineering.  Below we compare the reasons men left and factors related to persistence with the group of women engineering alumnae we surveyed in an earlier (2009-2011) study.\n\nWe compared reasons men leave the field of engineering with reasons women leave the field and found very similar reasons due to pay, lack of interest, lack of opportunities for advancement, lack of flexibility, but women were more likely to leave because they wanted to spend time with family or did not like the culture or their boss.\n\nWe used a social cognitive career theoretical perspective to predict turnover intentions.

Overall our model predicted 34% of the variance in turnover intentions for men, but 55% of the variance in turn over intention for women.\n\nMen and women were similar in that intending to leave one's job was highly related to intending to leave the profession of engineering.\n\nThe results indicate that the integrated SCCT model was a much more powerful predictor for women?s engineering turnover intentions, explaining over half of the possible variance than it was for men.  For men, our results suggest that the one facet of self-efficacy that plays a role in male engineers? engineering turnover intentions is their confidence in their ability to manage their work and family responsibilities. \n\nStudy 2 examined gender differences in engineers? retention using the Job Embeddedness (JE) theory.

We found no gender differences in the following variables:   Workload management; Promotion opportunities; Training and development opportunities; Level of work-family conflict; Pay satisfaction; Role overload; Job search behaviors.\n\nWe found gender differences in the following variables:\n\nMen were significantly higher on Engagement, Job Satisfaction, Career Satisfaction, Organizational Commitment, Commitment to the Engineering Profession, Perceptions of Fit with the Organization and with Engineering, Perceptions of Supportive Organization, Perceptions of Family Supportive Organization, Psychological Safety, Empowerment, and Fit with the Engineering Profession.\n\nWomen were significantly higher on Psychological Withdrawal, Role Ambiguity, Supervisory Undermining, Work Withdrawal, Job Turnover and Engineering Turnover (intent to leave the job and field)\n\nThe results of our studies contribute to a growing body of knowledge, especially in the context of a technical profession that has high costs of entry in terms of training, educational, and certification requirements, and a high cost of exit.
