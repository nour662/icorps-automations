 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the advent of adaptive optics (AO) has ushered in an era of dramatic discoveries that make use of the superb resolution of large ground-based telescopes, lack of knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) still stands as a fundamental limitation. Extragalactic, galactic and solar system AO science programs currently rely on non-synchronous PSF calibration stars, which results in increased random and systematic errors in astrometry, photometry, morphology and kinematics. The future of quantitative AO science, and the goal of the project proposed by Dr. Peter Wizinowich and his collaborators at the California Association for Research in Astronomy, lies in reconstructing synchronous PSF knowledge based on real-time telemetry collected from the telescope and AO system.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will develop PSF determination tools for on-axis both natural and laser guide-star AO science observations and demonstrate the quantitative science improvements that can be realized with these tools using the 10-m diameter Keck telescopes.  The significantly improved capabilities produced through this program will be directly available to astronomers at the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the University of Hawaii through their time allocation committees, while the entire U.S. community will benefit due to their access to Keck through NASA and the NSF Telescope System Instrumentation Program.  Moreover, success at the Keck Observatory would enable PSF determination to become a reality for AO on large telescopes worldwide, as the algorithms and techniques will be made publically available.  Keck will also reinforce its role in the training of AO experts and continue to offer educational programs and services to work with local residents, educators and especially students, including its strong participation in the Akamai Workforce Initiative aimed at local Hawaiian students.\r\n\r\nFunding for the development of real-time PSF assessment techniques is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.",

AO is now routinely used for science observations on the world&rsquo;s largest telescopes and is providing a much more detailed view of our universe. The ability of astronomers to extract quantitative information about the objects they study with AO is currently limited by lack of knowledge about the uncorrected aberrations in the image. These uncorrected aberrations can be measured by taking an exposure of a point source (i.e. a star) and the resultant image is known as the Point Spread Function (PSF). Unfortunately typically there is no star in the science field and the PSF varies with both time and position in the science field due to variations in atmospheric and observing conditions.</p>\n<p>One of the major challenges for achieving further breakthroughs in high angular resolution science is therefore to provide astronomers with an accurate estimate of the PSF with every science exposure. The result would be dramatic improvements in the quantitative science that can be obtained with AO; accuracy improvements by factors of a few to a hundred for measurements of brightness, position, velocity and structure depending on the science case (as illustrated by Figure 1). Our project has successfully demonstrated that an accurate PSF estimate can be produced using real-time information (i.e. telemetry) from the AO system taken in parallel with each science observation.</p>\n<p>Astronomers use the light from both natural and laser guide stars (NGS and LGS) passing through the atmosphere to measure the wavefront aberrations introduced by turbulence. We have developed and demonstrated algorithms for both of these cases where the calculated PSF is determined in the direction of the guide star. On-sky NGS AO testing consisted of closing the AO loops on the NGS. On-sky LGS AO testing consisted of pointing the LGS in the same direction as an NGS, closing the high order AO loops on the LGS and the low order loops on the NGS. In both cases an image of the NGS was taken with the science camera (this is the real PSF) and simultaneous AO telemetry data was used to produce a PSF estimate (the reconstructed PSF or PSF-R).</p>\n<p>These real and reconstructed PSFs have been compared in a number of ways to understand the accuracy of the reconstructed PSF. Figure 2 shows the star image (real PSF) at left, the reconstructed PSF at center and a slice through both images at right. Another metric for comparing the real and reconstructed PSFs is a normalized difference between the two PSFs summed over all of the detector pixels. This metric is plotted in Figure 3 for all of the on-sky data and shows that the reconstructed PSF is within 2% of the actual PSF for this metric.</p>\n<p>An additional benefit of our developing a deeper understanding of the AO delivered PSF has been a deeper understanding of the performance of the Keck AO systems and telescopes.
