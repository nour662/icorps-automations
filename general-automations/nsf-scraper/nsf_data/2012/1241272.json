 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at Clemson University in the summer of 2013 on uncertainty principals in harmonic analysis. The principal speaker will be Professor Alexei Poltoratski from Texas A&M University. The lectures will cover such areas as gap and type problems, Beurling-Malliavin theory for Teoplitz kernels, and Bernstein's Problem on weighted polynomial approximation. In addition to the 10 main lectures by Dr. Poltoratski, lectures will be presented by other experts in the field. \r\n\r\nHallmarks of the NSF/CBMS regional conference series are focus on a single important and timely area of research by a leading practitioner, a published monograph for a wider audience, and continued effect and local stimulation through regional recruitment emphasis.  The conference will provide a venue for advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients to interact with leading researchers in this field.  This award will support approximately 30 participants in the conference, mostly at early stages of their careers.",
