Special attention will be paid to baryonic effects and to other systematic errors, and tools will be built to best extract the cosmological information.  The simulation library and emulator will be necessary to realize the full potential of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and other future weak lensing datasets.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, release of simulation data, and outreach to the public via work at the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History.",
