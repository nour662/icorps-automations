 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT \r\nThis EAGER award creates an interoperability test bed to identify the components of an effective layered architecture for geoscience and environmental science research. In a layered architecture, every layer consists of different technologies, each of which uses different interaction protocols. The proposed project will examine a wide variety of existing technologies in terms of their effectiveness in working across present data silos. These technologies include data grids, workflow systems, policy management systems, web visualization services, and security protocols that work with various repository catalogs. Project goals are focused on developing cyberinfrastructure tools and approaches that allow geoscience data repositories to enable new science and more effectively make their data holdings discoverable and available to the public. Essential elements of the project include the collection and comparision of various approaches and existing tools to check effectiveness in handling and integrating geoscience data, and by automating processes needed to integrate various databases and data types. The project is led by a team of experts in cyberinfrastructure and geoscience data management and employs a spiral softwar3ee development approach. Broader impacts of the work include building infrastructure for science in order to facilitate data-enabled science in the geosciences. It will also produce results that are likely to be applicable to fields outside of the geosciences. The effort supports a larger NSF effort to establish a new paradigm in the development of an integrative and interoperable data and knowledge management system for the geosciences for a new NSF initiative called EarthCube.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe EarthCube Layered Architecture concept award assessed the types of cyberinfrastructure needed to support GeoScience disciplines.  In particular, the major goal was to demonstrate whether a loosely coupled federation environment could be used as the unifying infrastructure that links community resources to research environments.  A collaboration environment was proposed as the unifying infrastructure that would support the interoperability mechanisms needed to interact with existing cyberinfrastructure.  This approach captures the knowledge needed to interact with existing resources within interoperability mechanisms provided by the collaboration environment.\n\nThe demonstrations required the identification of appropriate EarthCube science scenarios, associated use cases, and the implementation of appropriate interoperability mechanisms.  The NSF DataNet Federation Consortium federation hub was used as the testbed for the demonstrations.\n\nA secondary goal was the identification of the types of interoperability mechanisms that were needed, and whether these interoperability mechanisms could be implemented within policy-based data management systems. \n\nMajor Activities\n\nA total of ten interoperability mechanisms were demonstrated.  They included interoperability mechanisms for accessing each community resource from the DataNet Federation Consortium collaboration environment, and either querying an information catalog, retrieving data, initiating a workflow, or archiving results:\n\nKepler workflow system\nNCSA Cyberintegrator workflow management system\nGeoBrain broker\nData Access  Broker (DAB)\nConsortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) Hydrologic Information System\nData Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) information catalog and repository\nData Conservancy repository\nNOAA Envrionmental Research Division\u00c6s Data Access Program (ERDDAP)\nSustainable Environment Actionable Data (SEAD) repository\niRODS workflow system for reproducible data driven research \n\n\nFour science scenarios were developed that used the interoperability mechanisms to support a research goal:\n\nStudy of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico\nEcohydrology analysis of a watershed\nAnalysis of river flow for Texas drought\nReproducible data driven research using workflow provenance\n\n\nSignificant results\n\nThe interoperability mechanisms were organized into three types of knowledge encapsulation.  The loosely coupled federated architecture captured knowledge needed to support:\n\nInteraction with a remote community resource.  The knowledge included support for execution of the required access protocol, and for quantifying input and output variables.\nManagement of the products cached within the collaboration environment.  This included management of the shared collection, as well as management of the interactions with the remote community resources.\nReproducible data driven research.  This included management of the provenance associated with each analysis workflow, sharing of workflows, and re-execution of workflows.\n\n\nThe interoperatiliby mechanisms were implemented through three basic mechanisms:\n\nDrivers that applied partial I/O manipulation at the community resource.  This requires installing software middleware at the community resource to manage manipulation of data from the community resource, before transmission over the network.  A simple example is data subsetting of a terabyte data set to avoid sending the entire file over the network.\nMicro-services that execute the interaction protocol required by a community resource.  In this case, no modifications are needed at the community resource.  Instead the interactions are controlled from the collaboration environment and implemented within the collaboration environment.  Data sets can be indentified, retrieved, and cached in the collaboration environment in support of research analyses.\nPolicies that control interactions with the community resource, or manage the shared collectio..."
