 "awd_abstract_narration": "The amount of primary production attributable to sea ice algae is seasonally and quantitatively important to current arctic marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. Although light and nutrients have been studied for decades as the determinants of ice-algal production, more complex synergistic effects between ice algae and other microbial residents of sea ice that may foster primary production are poorly known. Studies of sea-ice bacteria and algae, including genomic evaluations, have revealed potential links between compounds called compatible solutes (CS), commonly used by microbes to protect against osmotic shock (death by cell explosion) in high-salinity surroundings, and the availability of regenerated nitrogen within the ice. This research will test a seasonal-synergy hypothesis whereby CS precursor compounds (like choline) that are released by ice algae during fall freeze-up are taken up by bacteria in the ice, converted to CS for survival in the high-salinity brines of winter sea ice, and then metabolized for carbon, nitrogen and energy as spring temperatures warm, salinities freshen, and the need to retain CS as osmoprotectants diminishes. An important end product of this bacterial conversion of CS is ammonia, increasing the within-ice availability of nitrogen to ice algae on the verge of blooming as photosynthetically active radiation penetrates the ice. Elements of this proposed seasonal synergy between bacteria and algae encased in sea ice will be examined by a combination of field and laboratory approaches. Sea-ice brines will be collected during fall freeze-up and spring-bloom periods and tested for bacterial uptake of choline, conversion to CS, and remineralization, using radiolabeled and stable isotope-based incubations and spectroscopic methods. The latter will reveal the key bacterial phylotypes responsible for a CS-based seasonal synergy within sea ice. Measurements of temperature, salinity, pH, bacterial and viral abundances, chlorophyll pigments, and extracellular polysaccharide substances will provide environmental and biological context. Pure cultures of available and newly acquired (on CS- based media) sea-ice bacteria will be examined across temperature and salinity gradients to clarify the key processes.\r\n\r\nThis award will help to launch the faculty career of a polar early career scientist and provide unique training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students in the field, in the laboratory, at the computer, and in outreach efforts in Washington State, Alaska and Greenland. By conducting the proposed field research from the Greenland Climate Research Center in Nuuk, Greenland, this US team will foster international cooperation among scientists from the US, Greenland and Denmark, adding to the outcome and continuing pan-Arctic goals of the recently completed International Polar Year.",

Specifically, ice algae produce a chemical compound, choline, within their lipid membranes; when the algae die, this compound is released into the ice matrix. We have shown that bacteria within the ice in early spring can take up this choline and convert it into glycine betaine, a substance that can protect them from the extremely cold, salty conditions within the ice. Later, as the ice warms, it melts and freshens the brine channels in which the microbial community resides, such that the bacteria no longer require the protective compounds (called compatible solutes) and so they break them down to generate energy. When they do so, they release ammonia, a nutrient which can then be taken up by the ice algae to complete the cycle. While testing this hypothesis, we conducted field work in Kobbefjord, West Greenland, at a marine research station in Daneborg, East Greenland, and in Ukpia?vik, Alaska (formerly known as Barrow). In each of these locations, we collected microbes to examine the diversity of both bacteria and algae in these environments, and to isolate them in pure culture. Many of the isolates we obtained had the capability to break down choline and produce compatible solutes, and we conducted genome sequencing on these strains to learn about the diversity and evolution of this pathway. In two strains we isolated and used as representatives of the major components of the sea ice bacterial community, Polaribacter sp. 11 and Shewanella sp. 9, we found that both accumulated glycine betaine as an adaptation to low temperature, but that Shewanella sp. 9 also accumulated ornithine, an intermediate compound in the production of two other compatible solutes. This award has increased our understanding of the utilization of compatible solutes in sea ice and the microorganisms that catalyze these pathways. As part of this award, one female postdoctoral fellow was trained in sea ice field work and numerous student and public groups were addressed on topical issues such as the critical role of bacteria in recycling nutrients for use by photosynthetic primary producers, the importance of sea ice algae to Arctic food webs, and the subsequent consequences of the ongoing loss of sea ice in the Arctic as a result of human actions.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Roy&nbsp;E&nbsp;Collins</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203262/1203262_10178777_1478026465610_DSC_5300--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203262/1203262_10178777_1478026465610_DSC_5300--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sea ice with sediment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203262/1203262_10178777_1478026465610_DSC_5300--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sea ice with sediment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Rafted landfast sea ice near Ukpia?vik, Alaska (formerly known as Barrow).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Cryomics Lab, University of Alaska Fairbanks</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Roy&nbsp;E&nbsp;Collins</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sea ice with sediment</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203262/1203262_10178777_1478026670633_ScreenShot2016-03-30at5.25.20PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203262/1203262_10178777_1478026670633_ScreenShot2016-03-30at5.25.20PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Assembled genomes of sea ice bacteria\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1203262/1203262_10178777_1478026670633_ScreenShot2016-03-30at5.25.20PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Assembled genomes of sea ice bacteria\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Complete genome sequences of Arctic sea ice bacteria that were isolated from sea ice near Ukpia?vik, Alaska (formerly known as Barrow).
