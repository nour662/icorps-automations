 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the difficulty in working in the deep sea, especially around high-termperature hydrothermal vents that belch hot, corrosive, metal-rich fluids into ocean, novel instumentation needs to be developed and tested so important thermal and chemical fluxes associated with these systems can be determined. This research involves the testing, implementation, and data recovery from a unique acoustic sonar system (COVIS) that uses acoustic sonar and doppler phase shifts to make quantitative measurements of hydrothermal vent plume rise rates, volume fluxes, and plume shapes and distributions with time. Software will also be generated to enable processing of the resulting data and the extraction of heat fluxes, both in the plume emmanating from the hydrothermal vent and its rising thermal plume and from the diffuse flow of hot water along the seafloor around the vent. Field testing will occur at the Grotto hydrothermal vent cluster at the Endeavor vent field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge which is presently part of the Canadian mid-ocean ridge monitoring station. Resulting quantitative acoustic images of the plumes will be used to generate seafloor heat flux values that are fundamental to understanding the dynamics of hydrothermal venting. Three dimensional images of the hydrothermal plumes coming from the Grotto vents will also be generated. Project goals include determining linkages between time-varying flow measurements on the seafloor and fluxes higher in the water column. Broader impacts of the work include building infrastructure for oceanographic science in terms of developing hardware and software that will complement and potentially be implemented on NSF's newly installed Ocean Observing System infrastructure at the vent fields at Axial Volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, which is slated to be instrumented in 2013. Additional impacts include international collaboration with Canadian scientists, support of an institution in an EPSCoR state (New Jersey), support of two PIs from groups under-represented in the sciences, training of graduate and undergraduate students, and public outreach through the NEPTUNE Canada and NOAA outreach engines.",

The transferred heat and chemicals influence the composition of the ocean, affect ocean circulation, and support communities of animals and microbes. This project sought to understand the process and rate of heat transfer at a particular hot spring on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  Measuring temperature is relatively easy but measuring the transfer of heat is challenging.  At these hot springs heat is largely moved by the fluids flowing out of the seafloor in both localized high temperature vents (black smokers) and diffuse vents covering a wide area (diffuse flow).  We use sound sent out by a sonar (like a radar) to detect the turbulence of such moving fluids and measure rates and areas of discharge.\n\nPreviously, we (scientists from Rutgers University partnered with scientists and engineers of the Applied Physics Laboratory of the University of Washington) developed and built a sonar system that can image the plumes rising from black smokers in 3D and detect the surrounding seafloor seeps in 2D.  We sought to measure heat flux in the plumes (based on flow rates and volume fluxes) and areal extent of the diffuse flow to use as quantitative measures of their impact on the ocean.\n\nOur Cabled Observatory Vent Imaging Sonar (COVIS) was connected to a seafloor observatory called NEPTUNE from September 2010 to September 2015.

We also sought to estimate diffuse flow area and to investigate the potential for using the sonar data to estimate temperature or flow properties for diffuse flow.\n\nThe Imaging scans are used to reconstruct the geometry of the plume.  We have demonstrated that the plume bends in response to the local ocean currents, which are primarily but not entirely tidally driven.  Ongoing efforts seek to understand and describe the interactions of multiple plumes coming from black smokers on different parts of the mounds.\n\nThe Doppler scans are used to estimate the vertical speed and volume of flow for the plumes, which is then used to estimate the heat transfer rate for the black smoker(s) contributing to the plume.

Our work has provided opportunities for students to experience research and our results have been communicated through general publications as well as scientific journals.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/08/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen G Bemis"
