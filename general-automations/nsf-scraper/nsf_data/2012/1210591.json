 "awd_abstract_narration": "While it may seem like a matter of simple choices, feeding is a complex event with many potential trade-offs.  Current theory predicts that the goal of foraging is at least impart to maximize fitness, reproduction. However, to do this an individual must not only obtain food it must also avoid cost, such as being eaten itself.  This means that foraging involves significant trade-offs.  Therefore, to understand these types of trade-offs it is necessary to examine feeding within the boarder contexts of ecological, developments, and physiologically, as well as, behavioral conditions. Young animals have different skills than adults, and also they may have different constraints.  The goal of this study is to develop a model that can address these factors using the data on diving capacity, habitat, and foraging behavior across different age groups of sea otters.  The data do not involve direct manipulation of sea otters, instead they rely on using data being obtained form the US Geological Survey that has tagged sea otters already.  The results form this research should have boarder application to general foraging models for other species and will provide practical information on habitat requirements that can be used in the conservation and management of sea otters.  The results will also be made available to the public through the Monterey Bay Aquarium.",
