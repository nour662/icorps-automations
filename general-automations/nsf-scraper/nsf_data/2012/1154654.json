 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UCLA Mentoring Underrepresented Scholars in Engineering (MUSE) project addresses a National Science Board critical need of increasing engineering and computing degrees for the technical workforce and strengthening America's global competiveness. The project design derives from seminal research in active learning communities and its application to low-income engineering students from underrepresented groups. The project provides the resources to recruit, retain, mentor and graduate low-income underrepresented freshmen, community college transfers, and continuing students in the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science. For each year of the grant, MUSE scholarships are awarded to 5 incoming freshmen, 5 new community college transfer students, and 10 continuing students. Key project objectives are for the MUSE Scholars to succeed in gatekeeper courses and to exceed the School's overall retention to graduation percentage. To achieve these outcomes, MUSE provides support structures to increase Scholar's persistence and performance in gatekeeper engineering and computing courses. Additionally, the project provides closely monitored faculty and industry mentoring programs and professional development for Scholars to enter the workforce or advanced study. The MUSE project is adding to the understanding of retention in engineering by both broadening the participation and increasing graduation percentage of-low income engineering students from underrepresented groups.",

The MUSE objective was to close the academic and social gaps that all URES bring from high school. The mentoring program was focused solely on the MUSE Scholars. The summer bridge component made a strong impact on first quarter grades and created a close-knit peer supportive community. Analyzing the academic and non-academic curricular and co-curricular activities of the MUSE project should reveal association between interventions and Scholars? performance and attitudes. Future work may more directly link particular MUSE activities with the positive outcomes achieved. Greater understanding may be had by teasing out which experiences, events, and activities students themselves link to their individual and collective group successes. \n\n \n \n\n \nBroader Impact: The large majority of the low-income and first-generation students admitted to the School graduated from low-performing urban and rural high schools. They constitute the high-performing, multi-risk student population in bottom 40% of all School admits. Hence, they are the prime S-STEM scholarship and MUSE target. The MUSE project was designed as a high-impact practice, the intervention program is based upon the theories of Tinto (integration into the university academic and social systems), Bean (attitudes and behaviors drive academics), and Astin (degree and quality of involvement predicts success) to increase persistence in engineering and computer science.\n\n \n \n\n \n[1]American Society for Engineering Education.
