The workshop will focus on archive selection; best practices for data and meta data formatting; eliciting researcher participation; and providing for on-going technical and financial support. The overarching goal is to create a central site where researchers can go to locate sources of visual field recordings, digital data sets, websites, and archival collections of fieldnotes, photographs, coding sheets, and other materials. The workshop will bring together archivists, anthropologists, representatives of key anthropological institutions, and technical specialists. The resulting report will be widely disseminated through multiple publication venues to encourage a wider discussion and support from anthropological researchers.",
