 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the PI will study the group behavior of photosynthetic bacteria that are growing in biofilms and in dense populations. The photosynthetic bacteria that are the subjects of this study, the anoxygenic phototroph Rhodopseudomonas palustris and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, collectively carry out all major modes of metabolism that exist in the bacterial world. The PI will study the effects of different growth pressures on the pattern formation of these bacteria. The PI will grow and analyze the architecture of biofilms that are formed by photosynthetic bacteria which are growing in different metabolic modes. Mathematical models will be developed and compared to experiment to understand the physical principles that underlie the observed growth patterns. Experiments will also be performed to analyze in detail the collective motion of photosynthetic bacteria that are growing at high cell population densities, with system modifications inspired by photosynthetic biofilms. The research will explore a new range of parameter space for biologic pattern formation and collective bacterial motion, providing experimental evidence with which theoretical and simulational models may be compared. This research will be undertaken in an undergraduate-only institution and involves interdisciplinary faculty and student collaborations in applied physics and microbiology. Undergraduate students will be trained in techniques at the interface of these fields, will be co-authors on publications, and students will be expected to present results of this research at local and national meetings. The techniques and finding from this research will be used in the classroom in teaching of biology and physics, and the techniques developed and data obtained from this research will stimulate the development of future interdisciplinary courses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith this Research in Undergraduate Institutions grant we sought to contribute to the physics of biologic pattern formation and active systems and to increase understanding of the behavior of high-density microbiological systems that may someday aid in the development of applications from energy technology to bioremediation.  We investigated two areas of bacterial group behavior: phototrophic bacterial biofilm morphology and bacterial collective motion behavior.  This research has enabled insight into factors that influence the morphology and pattern formation of biofilms formed by a single species of phototrophic bacteria.  The metabolic mode of the bacteria resulted in quantifiable differences between biofilm structures (Image 1) that could be simulated using a hybrid discrete continuum model and recognized by a machine learning algorithm.  In our studies of collective motion using bacterial systems, we developed an experimental system to investigate and analyze the physical parameters that influence collective motion on a micro scale using single and multiple bacterial species (Image 2).  This work has resulted in greater understanding of the physical parameters that influence collective motion in bacterial systems.  This grant has enabled rich interdisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduates and supported a research program at the interface of physics and biology that will continue for years to come. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/24/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca J Christianson"
