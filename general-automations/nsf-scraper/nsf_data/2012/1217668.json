 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the proliferated growth of wireless communication services, the radio spectrum has become a precious resource. On the other hand, many licensed spectrum bands are considerably under-utilized in both time and spatial domains. This situation has motivated dynamic spectrum access to increase spectrum utilization. \r\n\r\nThis project proposes a novel application-oriented dynamic spectrum access model, termed on-demand spectrum access (ODSA), to capitalize on recent spectrum policies evolution, while eliminate technical barriers bothering the existing dynamic spectrum access model. We consider a spectrum service provider to offer on-demand spectrum services to users, such that users can dynamically set up application-oriented virtual topologies to carry out specific applications. This project will develop optimal or near-optimal spectrum allocation algorithms, and novel techniques to improve spectrum sharing and increase spectrum utilization. \r\n\r\nThe developed algorithms, techniques, and architectures have the potential to affect the spectrum authorities on policy reform of spectrum management, and affect the design, deployment, and operation of future wireless communication systems, to result in significant economical, societal, and public safety impacts. This project also offers an excellent opportunity to promote broadening participation of underrepresented minority students in research and education, by directly supporting underrepresented minority students and outreach activities.",
