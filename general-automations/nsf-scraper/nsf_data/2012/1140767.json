 "awd_abstract_narration": "At Calvin College faculty from Biology, Chemistry, and Mathematics and Computer Science are collaborating to reform the four courses of the introductory biology sequence to align with the findings of the document \"Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action.\" Building on problem-based learning in the first course, they are now developing laboratory modules, derived from faculty research, in the middle two courses, which culminate in student research projects in the fourth course. The three-week laboratory modules develop students' abilities to read and critique the scientific literature, to frame scientific questions and to seek their experimental answers, and to learn the conventions of oral and written communication of scientific results.  Like genuine research projects, the modules include quantitative and interdisciplinary features, so students are less inclined to see their STEM courses as isolated from one another. The lecture aspects of the courses have also been revised to be more student-centered and interactive, making use of the best ideas in pedagogy. Participating in the review and testing of this strategic reform are partners from two universities, four liberal arts colleges, and a community college, all of whom have collaborated with Calvin College on previous projects. Grand Rapids Community College contributes an external collaborator, a biologist, who receives a stipend for carrying out review, testing, and evaluation of the modules, as do the other collaborators.  By following the blueprint of \"Vision and Change\" for reform of classroom, laboratory, and assessment practices, Calvin College's project is sure to have a broad impact on undergraduate biology education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant funded the development and implementation of project-based laboratory modules for two introductory courses in the biology major at Calvin College.  These modules were developed in the summers of 2013 and 2014 with the assistance of undergraduate research students and an interdisciplinary team of faculty.  In place of the more traditional labs that emphasize a concept learned that week in lecture and teach methods in isolation of a research context, the new modules follow a guided inquiry progression (teaching essential skills first, then methodologies, and finally student-designed experiments) and reflect the typical research sequence (examining literature first, and then designing, conducting, and analyzing experiments).  Immediately following their first implementation, we experienced a mismatch between student learning gains and their perceptions and affective dispositions.  By conducting student surveys and focus group interviews, we were able to identify a number a factors that contributed to the mismatch.  We found that students needed more guidance in following the steps in the project from week-to-week.  They also needed more time to practice quantitative skills and guidance in applying them to data analyses.  This forced us to pare down our lab modules from three projects to two.  We also discovered that students mastered the quantitative reasoning skills more effectively when we provided prompts outlining the steps in calculating rather than just having students draw flowcharts of their experimental manipulations in order to discover the requisite calculations.  Finally, our experience also taught us the importance of faculty investment in the revision process: our modules have been fully implemented and improved in one course and only partially implemented in another course where the level of faculty investment was lower.  Our experience underscores the value of \"scientific teaching\" in implementing effective educational reforms. \n\nOur grant was also instrumental in expanding reforms beyond our department.  Our chemistry colleagues have made adjustments to their teaching of simple and serial dilutions after reviewing our evidence of the difficulties students were encountering; colleagues who teach more advanced courses are also reinforcing these skills so that students gain confidence in their abilities to use them.  The faculty development workshops we held led to other synergistic initiatives in our STEM division, including a weekly breakfast series sponsored by our academic dean that brought STEM faculty together to discuss strategic initiatives, including curricular and pedagogical reforms. Our dean also appointed the co-PIs of this grant to lead HHMI grant proposal-writing efforts for the past two years, where the focus is on institutional transformations in support of inclusive excellence.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David S Koetje"
