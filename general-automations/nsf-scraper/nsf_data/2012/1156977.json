Students will evaluate the strengths and\r\nweakness of existing methodologies and current practices for\r\nsafety assurance, as well as investigating issues such as how\r\nthe introduction of software safety requirements may affect\r\nthe software lifecycle and how software processes, methods\r\nand tool support should be adjusted.  In addition to research,\r\nstudents will take field trips to industrial partners and attend\r\nmentoring workshops on technical writing and oral presentation.\r\n\r\nThis REU site will allow students, especially those from\r\nunderrepresented groups or universities with limited research\r\nopportunities, to experience cutting-edge research in software\r\nsafety --- critical to the prevention of catastrophic accidents\r\nand safe operation of software-dependent systems. It will also\r\nencourage these students to continue into graduate programs and\r\ncareers in science and technology research. Students will gain\r\nproficiency in a broadly applicable skill set including oral\r\nand written communication, research methods, critical thinking,\r\nand problem solving.",
