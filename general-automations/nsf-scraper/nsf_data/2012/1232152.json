 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:  While wind power is becoming an important source of alternative energy, the adverse effect of wind farms on existing radar systems is raising serious concerns.  The objective of this research is to gain an in-depth understanding of electromagnetic scattering from wind farms. Our approach entails: (i) developing simulation techniques to predict and analyze dynamic radar signatures of wind farms, (ii) developing radar facility and measurement techniques to acquire scaled model and in-situ data from wind farms, and (iii) exploiting the knowledge for interference mitigation and turbine monitoring applications.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The proposed research will lead to an in-depth understanding of the dynamic radar signatures of large wind farms.  In the process, efficient simulation and measurement techniques will be developed to study the scattering from rotating turbine blades.  These techniques will be applicable to a much wider class of problems where the main radar features of interest lie in how target structural changes are manifested in the time-varying radar returns.  Examples include tracking of human activities and structural monitoring of large buildings and bridges.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The proposed research will result in a better integration of wind power with existing radar infrastructures.  The research findings will lead to technology advancement in interference mitigation and structural monitoring techniques.  The developed radar measurement facility will be made available to academic researchers, and should significantly bolster the research and education infrastructure in radar.  A number of outreach activities are planned to inspire K-12 students to pursue careers in science and engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhile wind power is becoming an important source of renewable energy, the adverse effect of wind farms on existing radar systems is raising serious concerns.  Wind farms create strong Doppler clutters and deep electromagnetic shadows that can lead to false alarms and missed detection of targets of interest like aircraft and storms.  In this project, we set out to address the following two research questions: 1) What is the basic scattering phenomenology behind wind turbine scattering, and how is it manifested in the dynamic radar signatures of wind farms? 2) Can we exploit the resulting understanding for radar interference mitigation or structural health monitoring of large wind turbines using radar?  To answer the first research question, we have developed simulation and in-situ measurement techniques to gain an in-depth understanding of the various mechanisms that occur in wind farm scattering. Based on this knowledge, we have designed processing algorithms for radar interference mitigation and structural monitoring applications.  The radar interference issue is currently a key barrier to wind power development.  Our research contributes to the timely removal of this barrier.  This will help lower the cost of wind energy and lessen the world?s dependency on fossil fuel.\n \n\nThis project has provided training opportunities for four graduate students, five undergraduate students and three high school students during the past four years.  They were closely involved in the modeling, simulation, and measurement of radar scattering from wind turbines.  They also received hands-on experience in using a state-of-the-art ultra-wideband radar transceiver.  In addition, we worked with several high school teachers through the UTeachEngineering program and the Science Olympiad organization to create activities to motivate students for potential careers in science and engineering.  In addition to using the transceivers to carry out our research, we have utilized them for teaching undergraduate electromagnetics.  Students in our undergraduate course Antennas and Wireless Propagation used the units to measure channel impulse response of indoor environments and study multipath phenomena.  This setup provides a low-cost pathway for other universities to build up the same capability, and can significantly bolster the infrastructure for radar research and education in the United States. \n \nThe results of our research have been disseminated through journal publications (8), conference presentations (12), PhD dissertations (2), and MS theses (3).  The primary graduate student who worked on this project won the 2013 FEKO student competition for his work on simulating the dynamic signatures of a wind turbine.  The results of our NSF-funded research are available through a web site, which is being accessed by both the wind power industry and numerous radar stakeholders in the US government.  The PI has also connected with the European community by co-organizing a convened session at the 2016 European Conference on Antennas and Propagation to showcase research being conducted in Europe and the United States on electromagnetic scattering of wind turbines and wind farm effects on radar systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/19/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ali Yilmaz"
