TNCB specimens of 0.25mm diameter will be obtained by a custom-designed coring device, while larger 0.40mm cores will be taken with a new commercial biopsy needle. Corresponding fine needle aspirate (FNA) specimens will be taken at or alongside the TNCB sample sites. While maintaining TNCB tissue within a tube or microfluidic chamber, the specimen will be fixed, stained, and optically cleared. Absorption dyes of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) will provide transmission image contrast for the morphological structure of cells and tissue.\r\n\r\nFluorescence dye will be imaged from various immunohistological targets, such as proteins expressed at the base epithelial membrane to help determine invasion and protein expression. Optical projection tomographic microscopy (OPTM) will be used to generate 3D multimodal images of biopsy tissue. Although the length of the tissue core will be longer than the microscope field of view (FOV), different regions of the tissue will be imaged and stitched together by image processing. Both 2D and 3D visualization of the entire TNCB specimen will be provided to a pathologist using a custom computer interface to manipulate the 3D dataset. Sensitivity and specificity of cancer diagnosis will be made using tissue-slice pathology as the gold standard. Comparative evaluation of pancreatic cancer diagnosis will be made between TNCB imaged with the OPTM versus conventional FNA. This new technique is expected not only to detect the presence of neoplastic cells but detect invasion of tissue by cancer cells.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project is to develop a more accurate and efficient means to make a diagnosis for the cells and tissue taken from an organ using a needle.  This tissue removed from the body is called a needle biopsy and the organ being studied in this project is the pancreas, and the disease is pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe bioengineering exploratory project has developed two new innovations for the semi-automatic processing of the millions of needle biopsies taken every year in the USA.  The first innovation is the use of a proof-of-concept plastic device that accepts the needle biopsy and processes the specimen using small pumps of chemical fixative to preserve the tissue, and then infusion of colorful stains to highlight the nucleus of the cell and the surrounding tissue around any disease to visualize the host response.  Finally the plastic fluidic device (the size of a small mobile phone) is used to pump into the tissue a fluid that reduces the light scattering so the optical microscope can see all the way through the tissue.  With all these steps being done in a small chamber in the plastic device without manual handling, the entire needle biopsy specimen can be prepared quickly while keeping the 3D microstructure of the cells and tissue nearly intact.  This new device and semi-automated procedure is novel, as current needle biopsies are simply cut into thin slices and imaged separately on a conventional optical microscope, and the native 3D structure of the tissue is not preserved.  The result of this exploratory project was the design, fabrication, and successful testing of an early prototype of this plastic device.  Demonstrations of this device were made that can accept a needle biopsy from a clinical needle and chemically fix the tissue, stain the tissue, and optically clear the tissue for subsequent 3D optical imaging. \n\nThe second innovation is the ability to image the specimen (which is long and thin like the pencil lead of a mechanical pencil) in 3D using a new optical microscope invented at the University of Washington Human Photonics Lab.  This Optical Projection Tomographic Microscope (OPTM) can image the needle biopsy specimens that are colored with an absorptive stain in the same manner as current thin tissue slices are imaged for 2D imaging.  The innovation is being able to image the needle biopsy specimen in 3D by rotating the specimen within a tube, seeing all perspectives in 360-degrees of rotation.  The resulting 3D optical image will allow the pathologist to determine if there is cancer and also the invasiveness of the cancer in 3D because the tissue surrounding the small tumor is also three-dimensional.  This new method of imaging tissue for making a cancer diagnosis is new, as current techniques require the tissue to be cut into thin slices and put on the more conventional optical microscope and image in only a single perspective without any 3D information.  The exploratory project results were the ability to image tissue to 1-mm in thickness that was optically cleared for the generation of 3D images of the entire length of the needle biopsy specimen.\n\nThe broader impacts are well beyond diagnosing pancreatic cancer and applied to all organs in which disease is diagnosed by acquiring a small piece of tissue using a needle biopsy device.  The benefit to society is the more accurate diagnosis expected using 3D imaging rather than using thin slices of tissue imaged in 2D only.  The ability of rapid point-of-care diagnosis is made possible by the automation provided by the pathology lab-on-a-chip approach.  Intellectual merit is in the technical advancement of point-of-care diagnostics, microfluidics, and 3D optical imaging and 3D digital pathology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/15/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric J Seibel"
