 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to discover robust and cost efficient power generation scheduling, in order to maintain a smart and secure power grid while ensuring high utilization of renewable energy. The approach is to study innovative robust and chance constrained optimization models along with solution methodologies to provide thermal unit commitment decisions incorporating intermittent renewable generation. \r\nIntellectual Merit: This project proposes one of the first studies on two-stage robust and chance-constrained optimization methods to solve power grid optimization problems. The proposed project will enrich scientific methods to solve power grid optimization problems under renewable generation uncertainty, while ensuring system reliability. In addition, the proposed solution approach will lead to methodology innovations for robust and chance constrained optimization, including deriving exact separation algorithms for two-stage robust unit commitment problems and proving the convergence of the sample average approximation algorithm for two-stage chance constrained stochastic programs. \r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed research is extremely beneficial for the reliability runs for system operators to achieve cost efficiency and security. It will also provide a tool to estimate the storage capacity requirement in order to guarantee a certain percentage (e.g., 80%) of electricity usage coming from renewable. In addition, the collaboration with national research labs facilitates testing real data and implementation at energy markets in short time, which will immediately benefit the society. Finally, results from this project will be disseminated through multiple means, including journal publications and conference presentations, and underrepresented students will be involved in all aspects of this research effort.",

Up till 2017, renewable energy has surged to 18% of the U.S. power mix. In particular, solar and wind projects made up the majority of new power construction. For instance, roughly 62% of new power constructions in 2017 came from solar and wind projects (from Fortune magazine), due to their cost continuing to plummet. On the other side, however, a large amount of renewable energy at different locations in the power grid system causes challenges for power system operators to maintain the system reliability due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy. The main challenge is that the system operators have the obligation to balance the system while taking the most advantage of renewable energy. During the past, power system operators have been keeping around 3% to 5% extra generation capacity as the reserve amount to accommodate the uncertainties in the load side. This policy faces significant challenges recently since the magnitude of the uncertainty for the renewable generation is much more significant. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />In this project, the PI studied a systematic approach, deriving innovative optimization under uncertainty techniques, more specifically, two-stage robust optimization and chance-constrained models, to decide the reserve amount for the power systems while minimizing the total operational cost. For the robust optimization approach, the randomness of the renewable generation is described using an uncertainty set, which includes the worst-case scenario. Then, a robust power generation schedule for the thermal generators in the day-ahead market can be obtained by minimizing the total cost while ensuring the generation schedule is feasible for all possible renewable generation output in the uncertainty set. This proposed approach is more reliable because the worst-case scenario has been considered. For the chance-constrained approach, our model ensures that, with high probability, a large portion of the renewable generation output at each operating hour will be utilized. This is an alternative approach to minimize the total power generation cost while ensuring enough renewable generation to be utilized. This proposed model includes both the two-stage and chance-constrained stochastic program features. These types of problems are challenging and have never been studied together before.
