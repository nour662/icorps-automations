 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support to defray expenses of participants to attend a conference on Nevanlinna Theory and Complex Geometry during March 14-18, 2012 at the University of Notre Dame. The conference will center around Nevanlinna theory and complex hyperbolic geometry. Notre Dame has been a power house in these areas. In recent years, there has been much important progress, including several major breakthroughs, in the study of complex hyperbolic geometry and Nevanlinna theory. The purpose of this conference is to gather experts in the field of algebraic or complex geometry, especially complex hyperbolic geometry and Nevanlinna theory, to report and understand the recent exciting discoveries and techniques.\r\n\r\nSpecial efforts will be made to invite young researchers, graduate students and women mathematicians to participate and to give talks during the conference. We expect that this conference will have a positive impact on young researchers and graduate students in the field. The members of the organizing committee are planning to act as editors of a special proceedings volume for the proposed conference. Each submitted paper will be carefully refereed to ensure the submission is appropriate and is of high quality. It is expected that many publishers will be interested in printing such a volume. The conference will provide a platform of communication, to explore further collaboration on the diverse areas related to this subject, to further expound on new ideas and to introduce the rapid developments in this area to a new generation of mathematicians. The geographic diversity of the participants should contribute to the fast dissemination of new scientific developments reported in this conference. Details about the conference, list of speakers,  participants, and scientific program can be found at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nd.edu/~conf/complex_geometry2012/",
