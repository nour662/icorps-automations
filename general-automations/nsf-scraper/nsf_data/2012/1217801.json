 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support costs for the conference Design and Analysis of Experiments 2012 (DAE 2012) at the University of Georgia from October 17, 2012 to October 20, 2012. The conference features leading researchers of international repute, promising new researchers, and graduate students actively pursuing research in the area of design and analysis of experiments. Participants represent academia, industry and government, and the conference offers a forum for interaction, discussion, and exchange of ideas on novel research in this area. Special sessions and activities to facilitate mentoring of junior researchers are an important focus of the conference. Themes of DAE 2012 include computer experiments, designs in marketing and business, designs in the pharmaceutical industry, algorithms for finding efficient designs, fractional factorial designs, designs for generalized linear models, designs for nonlinear models, designs for correlated data, and design robustness. The award provides partial support for approximately 40 participants.\r\n\r\nDesign and analysis of experiments are indispensable in the scientific process. Experiments are an integral part of the discovery process in virtually all scientific disciplines and in engineering and manufacturing. Rapid developments have taken place in research on design and analysis of experiments, both in more traditional areas of application and, especially, in entirely new areas of application. This conference, DAE 2012, helps the advancement of cutting edge research in design and analysis of experiments by bringing together senior and junior researchers from academia, industry and government. DAE 2012 prepares future researchers in design and analysis of experiments through extensive mentoring activities that stimulate interactions between senior and junior participants. The conference makes significant efforts to broaden the participation of under-represented groups. Indirectly, by virtue of the fact that design and analysis of experiments play critical roles in the process of discovery and improvement in science, engineering and manufacturing, activities at the conference have an enormous impact on society. The conference website address is http://www.stat.uga.edu/dae2012.",
