 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Fall Series Symposium (FSS) is the first international gathering in North America in the field of computational aspects of affective narrative, bringing together participants from a long list of contributing disciplines. One of the aims of the Symposium is to attract students to a new and exciting multidisciplinary area, where it is still easier to attract the experts' attention and mentoring. The goal of this grant is to subsidize travel, registration fees, and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the Symposium which will be held, along with several other AAAI Fall Symposia, on November 2-4, 2012, in Arlington, VA. \r\n\r\nThe Symposium calls for long and short papers both from leaders in the field of computational aspects of affective narrative and pertinent areas and from graduate students as well as poster presentations from the undergraduate students interested in the subject. Papers from undergraduates, attracted through Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and Senior Research Opportunity Program (SROP) networks as well as solo graduate contributions will be carefully mentored to the level of poster or short paper eligibility. The multi-format program of the Symposium will also accommodate special student sessions, especially for promising but not fully developed ideas. \r\n\r\nThe AAAI FSS Symposium on computational aspects of affective narrative provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of multidisciplinary researchers in a variety of pertinent disciplines to enter the computational affective narrative research community.  It is expected that the Symposium will attract underrepresented populations as well as provide benefit to future development of computational systems from better understanding of affective narrative as the inherently human phenomenon.",
