 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project led by Polk Community College is enhancing an existing Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Technology program and converting it to an Open Entry/Open Exit (OEOE) format. In the OEOE format, course objectives are divided into single credit hour units that can be scheduled to fit time constraints of students. The program addresses the needs of working students and provides a learner centric focus. Through outreach activities, student interest in advanced manufacturing and enrollment in the program is increased. \r\n\r\nThe OEOE format is modeled on other successful programs but tailored to fit the local constraints within the Florida College System. NSF sponsored ATE Centers are partnered with Polk Community College to assist with the curriculum development efforts. The project is responsive to local industry needs and has industry involvement throughout the planning and implementation. Students can also be placed in industries to obtain practical experience and by collaborating with four year institutions; the project is enabling students to transfer to four year schools to continue their studies. \r\n\r\nThe OEOE format and a partnership with the Polk County Public Schools enable secondary and college instructors to strengthen their knowledge of Advanced Manufacturing principles by completing selected units of study. This instructor development ensures a strong sustainable program.",

CBE, along with personalized approaches, has become an emerging model that a number of institutions are exploring to better respond to local employer needs and to facilitate student success. To empower students through the educational process and align to the needs of non-traditional students in an affordable, accessible, and targeted manner, Polk State College has implemented a ground-breaking competency based education (CBE) Engineering Technology degree program that was initiated as a result of NSF-ATE funding, which is now in the third year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The Open-Entry / Early-Exit (OEEE), Engineering Technology Associate of Science degree is a hybrid, CBE, modular, non-term, self-paced, learner-centered, faculty-mentored format that serves to educate two-year students creating career pathways into the high-performance field of applied engineering / advanced manufacturing.&nbsp; Polk State&rsquo;s OEEE Engineering Technology program has implemented:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>educational reform through the transition of a traditional AS degree in Engineering Technology to an open-entry / early-exit, hybrid competency-based, modular, open-lab, degree program; </li>\n<li>professional development &ndash; technical skills professional development for the college and secondary program faculty and pedagogical professional development for the college staff and faculty on competency-based program development and delivery; and </li>\n<li>outreach programs &ndash; increased collaboration with secondary feeder programs in the college&rsquo;s service area, disruptive innovation applied to advisory council collaboration, and greater engagement with industry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Default\">In the 60 credit hour degree program, the 42 credit hours of Engineering Technology courses have been converted from 14, three-credit courses to 42, one-credit courses to allow for greater student flexibility, industry certificate content mapping, and modularized completion.&nbsp;The flexible modular format is a true non-term OEEE registration process, operating within the guidelines of the Florida College System. The open lab non-term program is increasingly accessible to working learners and is learner-centered rather than faculty-centered; building a collaborative relationship between the secondary system and the college that embeds certification-based articulation resources and pathways into the program; and providing pathways to baccalaureate degrees.
