Hunt (Dow Chemical Company) and Prof. Mamadou S. Diallo (Caltech and KAIST) will be co-organizing a 1-day symposium at the fall ACS annual meeting in 2012.  The symposium is titled \"Ensuring the Sustainability of Critical Materials and Alternatives: Addressing the Fundamental Challenges in Separation Science and Engineering\". The aims of the symposium are to: 1. Discuss the issues related to stresses in the global market and the key and enabling role of SSE in ensuring a sustainable supply and utilization of critical materials; 2. Bring into focus crosscutting research needs and Scientific Grand Challenges in SSE associated with the sustainable extraction, recovery, recycling and purification of critical materials; and 3. Communicate these research needs to the SSE and broader science/engineering community.  In addition to the organized talks and panel discussion during the symposium, the symposium content will be summarized in a comprehensive report and a dedicated new website will be set up for permanent dissemination of symposium materials.",
