 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary project will explore the technological, environmental, and socioeconomic barriers to adopting sustainably printed organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules for building-integrated solar power production by considering the overall life cycle of the product.  Research efforts will focus on: 1) validating a new strategy for recouping photocurrent losses in high photovoltage devices, 2) providing a cradle-to-grave assessment of printed OPV modules as building-integrated roofing shingles, 3) developing a general route to achieving state-of-the-art efficiencies from halogen-free solvents, and 4) developing a comprehensive picture of the charge generation/recombination mechanism for a novel homologous series of fullerene-free organic acceptors.\r\n\r\nWhile solar power technically has the greatest potential of any sustainable resource, it is currently used to supply only about one-tenth of one percent of worldwide energy demand.  The ability to implement any potentially disruptive technology for solar power generation is constrained from below by the performance, manufacturability, and competing uses/economics of available materials, and constrained from above by decision making frameworks (public/fiscal policy, individual finance) related to, among other things, the product?s cradle-to-grave life cycle.  This project will explore the sustainability of solar power devices capable of being fabricated from novel organic dyes and polymers (organic photovoltaics or OPVs) that require low energy inputs and low capital investment.  Because OPVs can be relatively lightweight and can be arbitrarily molded to flexible or curved substrates, they have potential for being integrated into building components such as roofing shingles, thus bringing down costs.  This research will assess the technological, environmental, and socioeconomic feasibility of such applications.\r\n\r\nThis project will also engage and mentor high school students in hands-on learning activities that demonstrate the basic solar energy concepts of absorbing light and converting it to electricity, will share research results with a broad public audience, and will establish university-industry partnerships in the area of solar energy development.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported under the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the necessary workforce to address these challenges.  With SEES Fellows support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to sustainability.",

For example, &ldquo;<em>How do the nature of recombination pathways influence light-to-electricity conversion efficiency?</em>&rdquo; These findings are reported in a series of 10 peer-reviewed scientific articles. When a solar cell efficiently turns sunlight into electricity, the energy from the sun effectively pulls apart two opposite charges that are attracted to each other. Negative charge is pushed in one direction and positive charge in the other direction, producing the electricity flow that can power an appliance or charge a mobile phone. &nbsp;However, if a positive charge reencounters a negative charge in the cell, the two charges can again become stuck to one another, halting the flow of electricity. This process of re-attraction and the resulting power loss is called charge recombination. The underlying photophysics of OPV materials leads to the possibility that these recombination events can produce positive and negative charge pairs in which the quantum mechanical property of electrons known as &ldquo;spin&rdquo; can lead to different configurations. Prior to this NSF-funded project, it was commonly assumed that certain spin configurations, called triplet states, were unavoidable energy loss pathways. One major finding of this project was the discovery that triplet energy levels need not limit photocurrent collection in OPVs [Schlenker, et al. <em>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</em> 2012, 134 (48), 19661].
