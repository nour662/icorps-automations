 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Saddleback College S-STEM Scholars Program is utilizing S-STEM scholarship funding to support academically talented and financially needy students in STEM disciplines. The Scholars Program is awarding crucial financial aid to 14-20 full time students each academic year. It serves to support students entering Mathematics, Pre-Engineering, and Chemistry programs and allows them to pursue their immediate educational goal of completing an associate degree and/or transferring to a university to complete a BS degree in a STEM major. Recruiting efforts for the program are focused on underrepresented populations and veterans. \r\n\r\nIn addition to providing student financial support, S-STEM Scholars are encouraged to engage in extra-curricular opportunities in research (Chemistry/Engineering) and computer applet development under the direct supervision of faculty mentors and research collaborators. Creating a sense of family for the S-STEM scholars is a critical piece of this program, and social activities serve to bring S-STEM scholars, faculty members, and other highly motivated STEM students together on a regular basis to promote networking and a sense of belonging to a group with shared interests and goals. Additionally, many S-STEM scholars participate in STEM related conferences as a group with their faculty mentor. S-STEM Scholars attend transfer workshops as a group and must complete a transfer assessment through the Saddleback College Transfer Center after being selected for the program. Participants receive group and individual tutoring as needed and attend a workshop on Research Ethics as part of the overall program, and they also participate in career guidance seminars and assess internship opportunities with STEM industry partners.",
