Information about the conference can be found at http://math.gc.cuny.edu/conferences/szpirofest.html\r\n\r\nThe conference will focus on the following three major themes and their interconnections: \"unlikely intersections in algebraic groups,\" \"non-abelian Chabouty method,\" and \"arithmetic dynamics.\" Such a conference is particularly timely in view of the many recent breakthroughs in these subjects.\r\n\r\nSolving Diophantine equations, i.e., finding solutions in rational integers of polynomial equations is one of the earliest branches of mathematics. The CUNY conference on Diophantine geometry and dynamical systems will survey the most recent advances in this ancient subject. All the conference topics are central to number theory and extremely active subjects of current research. By bringing together leaders in these areas, the hope is to further inspire cross-fertilization among these closely connected, fundamental areas of mathematics. A major goal would be to encourage younger researchers and graduate students to attend, so as to introduce them to a very active field and to prepare them for further research.",
