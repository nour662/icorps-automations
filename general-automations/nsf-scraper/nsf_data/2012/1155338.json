 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Mark Golitko and colleagues will conduct one field season of excavation and survey targeted at reconstructing mid-Holocene (~7000-3000 BP) landscape, environment, settlement patterning, subsistence, and exchange networks near Aitape, northern Papua New Guinea (PNG).  The project brings together American, Australian, and New Guinean experts in Pacific prehistory, paleo-environment, and paleo-tsunami research.  \r\n\r\nThe north coast presents considerable environmental challenges to human survival.  For instance, a massive tsunami in 1998 wiped out villages along Sissano Lagoon, and similar events are believed to occur several times per century.  The north coast of PNG is also heavily impacted by the ENSO cycle, which can cause severe subsistence stress resulting from alternating cycles of heavy rainfall and drought.  This region is among the most linguistically and biologically diverse places on earth, suggesting a history of inter-community isolation, yet in recent history, coastal communities are linked into extensive social networks through which goods, people, and ideas travel.  These social connections presently serve in part as a form of insurance in the face of environmentally driven risk. Thus, in addition to informing scientists about the past, the research has the potential to provide insight into successful strategies to mitigate the detrimental effects of extreme environmental events.\r\n\r\nThe place of the north coast of PNG in Pacific prehistory is controversial and poorly understood due to a relative paucity of research conducted there.  In one view, the north coast was largely uninhabited and isolated from Island Melanesia prior to the disappearance of Lapita style pottery after ~2000 BP, resulting in significant linguistic, genetic, and cultural differences between people living on the mainland and off-shore islands.  Alternatively, it has been suggested that the introduction of highland PNG domesticates during the mid-Holocene period increased population levels on the coast to such a level that new settlers were excluded from the region.  From another perspective, the north coast may have served as a significant barrier to human movement and interaction only prior to the stabilization of world sea-levels and formation of productive alluvial plains after ~6000 BP.  Settlement on these alluvial plains, in conjunction with an upswing in ENSO frequency after ~7000 BP may have increased the degree of social interaction as populations on the north coast became increasingly exposed to environmental risk.  Thereafter, the north coast formed the heart of an interaction sphere through which people, goods, and ideas freely moved.  \r\n\r\nTo test these alternative hypotheses regarding north coast prehistory, excavations will be conducted at two sites located on the reconstructed mid-Holocene shoreline inland from the modern town of Aitape - Paniri Creek, where human remains dating to the mid-Holocene were previously recovered in association with potential paleo-tsunami deposits, and Kobom/NGRP25, where obsidian was collected during prior survey work.  Survey and coring at river-cuts and garden clearings elsewhere along the mid-Holocene shoreline will provide a broader regional perspective on paleo-environment.  Excavation and survey will target paleo-environmental indicators (pollen, phytoliths, charcoal), datable materials, and obsidian for sourcing analysis.  \r\n\r\nThe project will provide significant new information about prehistory on the north coast that will address the origins of human diversity in the Pacific.  The study will examine long-term human adaptive responses to climate change and sea-level rise, and therefore contribute to modern policy debate in PNG and elsewhere regarding global warming, sea-level rise, and effective response to environmental risk.  Involvement by local archaeologists and students will contribute to archaeological training in PNG.",

An international team of scholars including two New Guinean archaeologists and team members from the US, New Zealand, and Australia conducted two field season of combined archaeological survey and excavations and environmental sampling in the area around Aitape, northern Papua New Guinea were carried out during 2014 and 2016, targeting inland areas that were likely near-shore environments during the period between about 7000 and 3000 years ago, when sea-levels were up to two meters higher than at present. Archaeological excavations recovered abundant evidence for human settlement dating back 2000 years, but little evidence for earlier settlement, particularly during the period between 5000-2000 years ago. However, dating of sediments and analysis of indicators of past environment contained within them (diatoms, pollen) suggests that older archaeological deposits are deeply buried at present, and that land surface stabilized some 2000 years ago, accounting for greater archaeological visibility of sites dating to the more recent past. These environmental analyses show that between about 13,000 and 6500 years, ago, the region around Aitape consisted of narrow coastal flats and freshwater lakes. These lakes were periodically inundated with sea-water, likely during tsunami events like the ones that still regularly impact the circum-Pacific region. After about 6500 BP, the coastal flats expanded in extent and developed a series of large productive lagoons that may have supported more substantial settlement than was previously or currently the case. Given known increases in ENSO (El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation) frequency (a climate phenomenon which has major impacts on the southern Pacific and New Guinea in particular, creating subsistence stress and other risk via alternating cycles of droughts and torrential rains) and the likelihood that lagoon formation fostered substantially increased population levels during the mid-Holocene, risk exposure would have been heightened, and may in part have driven the development of larger scale networks of intercommunity interaction and increasing mobility as ways to offset risk, as documented through the wide scale movement of materials between communities after about 6500 BP documented in the regional archaeological record. Analysis is still ongoing to determine empirically whether land use patterns changed and settlement intensity increased during the mid-Holocene period coincident with lagoon formation.
