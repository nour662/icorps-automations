 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal explores how software designers and developers with can obtain information about the power behavior of the software they are developing and guide them toward designing and developing more energy efficient solutions. Very little is understood today about what factors in software design/development influence power consumption, and therefore this exploratory project will do empirical studies to measure the power consumption of executing software and map the power profiles to implementation and design properties of the software applications. The research will measure power consumption of executing software and map it to code sequences, then identify a set of program properties that are correlated to specific power consumption behavior. While research on energy sustainability has so far focused on the role of hardware design, compilation techniques aimed at optimizing with respect to power consumption, and operating systems, this exploratory project is aimed at understanding how the programming the source code can be correlated to low-power implementations.",
