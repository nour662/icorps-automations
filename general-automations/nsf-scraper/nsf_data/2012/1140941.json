 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at California State University-Long Beach (CSULB) is developing a hands-on laboratory- and project-based virtual course on sustainability of the built environment using Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology. Demand for specialists who can integrate BIM and Green Design is increasing because sustainability is becoming a driving force in industrial practice. Using BIM to analyze building performance enables students to go beyond conventional 2D and 3D models used for purely visualization purposes. The outcomes of this project include ten core modules and five advanced modules, including solar radiation analysis, day-lighting analysis, shading analysis, ventilation and air flow analysis and quantification and analysis of greenhouse gas emissions due to the building materials and energy use of the buildings. Through these modules, the students develop a strong foundation for understanding global environmental problems such as climate change and ozone depletion, being familiar with the concept of building assessment, gaining a clear understanding about sustainable development and sustainable construction, and understanding the relationships between sustainability and building materials, building forms, and building systems. The modules cover seven credit categories of the United States Green Building Council's rating system, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), including sustainable sites, energy and atmosphere, water efficiency, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation in designs, and regional priority. The project has the following educational components: 1) Sustainability in Built Environment; 2) Changes of Teaching Method in Engineering Education using BIM, and 3) Sustainability in Construction Education. One component of the project introduces K-12 students to green buildings and BIM technology through outreach programs available at CSULB campus, which is designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution.",

To incorporate the LEED requirements, BIM-based LEED Evaluation Software for Existing Buildings has been developed and presented. Finally, the comprehensive assessment and evaluation are presented with statistical analysis and findings. Based on the statistical analysis and results of assessment and evaluation, the project goal was well achieved by enhancing students learning of sustainability significantly through an innovative virtual approach using BIM technique. The Green BIM approach inspired undergraduate students with Green Buildings associated with BIM for the sustainable development of a built environment as the demand for specialists in these two emerging fields is increasing tremendously since green buildings education, research, and practice issues are becoming driving forces in academia and industry. The Green BIM approach, if successfully implemented in a construction education curriculum, will provide students with building models containing integrated architectural information to implement sustainability that goes beyond both conventional 2D solutions using electronic drafting board and 3D modeling for purely visualization purposes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/22/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joseph&nbsp;J&nbsp;Kim</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140941/1140941_10217915_1482445841014_NSFImage01--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140941/1140941_10217915_1482445841014_NSFImage01--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BIM Model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140941/1140941_10217915_1482445841014_NSFImage01--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BIM Model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">BIM Model developed for BIM manual for this project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joseph Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;J&nbsp;Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BIM Model</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140941/1140941_10217915_1482445891428_NSFImage02--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140941/1140941_10217915_1482445891428_NSFImage02--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students in the lab\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140941/1140941_10217915_1482445891428_NSFImage02--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students in the lab\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students working in the lab</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joseph Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;J&nbsp;Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students in the lab</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140941/1140941_10217915_1482446005035_NSFImage03--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140941/1140941_10217915_1482446005035_NSFImage03--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"LEED Checklist Software\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140941/1140941_10217915_1482446005035_NSFImage03--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"LEED Checklist Software\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">LEED Checklist Software for developed in this project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joseph Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;J&nbsp;Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LEED Checklist Software</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140941/1140941_10217915_1482446068563_NSFImage04--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140941/1140941_10217915_1482446068563_NSFImage04--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Result graph\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140941/1140941_10217915_1482446068563_NSFImage04--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Result graph\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">One of the result graphs</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joseph Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;J&nbsp;Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Result graph</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
