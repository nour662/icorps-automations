 "awd_abstract_narration": "Streams occupy a small part of Earth's surface, but are disproportionately important for transport and processing of nutrients and for maintaining global biodiversity. Logjams in streams increase retention of nutrients and fish production. Human removal of logjams is pervasive in forested ecosystems, creating \"dam-impoverished\" streams with limited capacity to store nutrients and produce fish. A prime example is streams of the southern Rocky Mountains, where a legacy of wood removal has greatly reduced logjams. This project asks: Does the loss of jams reduce the productive capacity of headwater streams? It is hypothesized that the loss of jams makes streams more leaky of nutrients, with subsequent decreased nutrient processing and fish production. This project will examine logjams and jam-associated processes across a gradient of streams, including streams in old-growth forests, unmanaged younger forests, and intensively managed forests.  This work will provide the first landscape-scale assessment of the effects of jam removal on stream ecosystems. This research can transform current understanding of wood effects on stream ecosystems by combining estimates of logjam historical distribution with intensively measured geochemical and biological variables in contemporary jams, allowing extension of local-scale observations to entire steam networks.\r\n \r\nUnderstanding how the loss of jams affects streams will inform resource management of headwater streams in forested landscapes. The National Park Service and the US Forest Service oversee vast tracts of forested lands in the American West and are attempting to restore some of the inferred historical characteristics of the Rocky Mountain landscape. By enhancing understanding of changes in jams, as well as the biogeochemical and ecological influence of these structures, the proposed work will provide much-needed context for these management actions.  This project will also provide training for one post-doctoral scholar and four graduate students. It will also provide research experiences for several undergraduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStream networks facilitate the chemical transformation of many compounds dissolved in stream water (\"solutes\") as they transport water and solutes across landscapes.  The chemical transformations which occur in streams influence local and downstream ecology and water quality.  Nitrate, which is introduced into stream networks both naturally and by human activity, is a primary nutrient required for growth of algae in streams.  At high concentrations, nitrate can facilitate algal blooms that disrupt aquatic ecosystems and may cause human health concerns.  \n\nDenitrification is a microbial process by which nitrate is converted to inert di-nitrogen gas and thus naturally removed from streams. Stream denitrification is an important process which may limit the negative effects of human-derived nitrate loading; however, our understanding of whole-stream denitrification rates is limited by the difficulty of making denitrification measurements across entire stream systems.  \n\nIntellectual Merit:  This project uses a computer simulation model that uses a limited number of local field measurements of denitrification to examine nitrate transport and removal across entire stream networks. Although other models have been used to help understand nitrate in stream networks, our model is the first to incorporate the effects of stream respiration rate (the rate of oxygen consumption in a stream) as a predictor of stream denitrification rates.  By incorporating the influence of stream respiration rate, this model provides a realistic connection between stream nitrogen and carbon dynamics, and is therefore capable of revealing, for instance, the potential effects of stream temperature, stream sediment carbon content, or other factors which affect stream respiration, on the distribution and rates of stream network denitrification and associated water quality.\n\nTo provide a baseline for understanding respiration-derived influences on stream network denitrification, we formulated a simple relationship between stream temperature and respiration rate.  Across two high elevation stream networks, we found that stream temperature could be predicted by understanding what fraction of water in a stream was derived from an upstream lake, the elevation of the upstream lake, and the elevation of the location where water temperature was measured.\n\nResults from the temperature investigation allowed us to predict stream temperatures across our study networks, incorporate effects of temperature on stream respiration in our model, and thus ultimately simulate temperature effects on denitrification.  By comparing our results to previous findings from models that did not incorporate the effects of stream temperature and respiration, our results reveal that warm temperatures in lower elevation streams enhance respiration rates and increase rates of denitrification relative to cooler, higher elevation streams.  Our findings suggest that low-elevation mainstem rivers may be more important contributors to denitrification than suggested by prior research.\n\nWe are now finalizing research that uses this model to predict locations in stream networks that have especially high potential for denitrification.  Prior research shows that instream structures such as logjams can facilitate the accumulation of organic matter and therefore enhance stream respiration.  By incorporating the frequency and spatial distribution of log jams into our model, we are quantifying the simultaneous influence of stream temperature and the patchy distribution of organic matter availability on respiration and associated denitrification rates in stream networks. \n\nBroader Impacts:  Management of nutrients in stream systems in important to preserving stream ecology and water quality, however, the complexity of factors influencing stream nutrient concentrations makes informed management difficult.  By establishing relationships between stream temperature, sediment carbon, and denitrification rate, our modeling approach can reveal specific mechanisms which influence stream reach and network denitrification.  Improved mechanistic understanding of these processes provides important information to support improved management of water quality.  Current findings suggest that denitrification from larger, warmer streams may be more significant than previously thought.  Our nearly complete work to evaluate the importance of log jams and associated accumulation of organic matter will further inform management decisions by revealing connections between in-stream structures, stream morphology, and stream denitrification.\n\nParticipation by graduate students and early career scientists in this study has provided invaluable training opportunities for the next generation of researchers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Geoffrey C Poole"
