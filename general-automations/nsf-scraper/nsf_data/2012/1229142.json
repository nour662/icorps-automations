 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award for an inverted optical microscope will enable research across five different departments at Union College including Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. This new instrument, integrated with an existing atomic force microscope (AFM), offers simultaneous collection of fluorescence and morphological data under controlled environmental conditions (temperature and humidity). The new integrated system will be used to: 1) study in-situ phase transitions and mechanical properties of soft materials (semi-crystalline polymers and polymer nanocomposites) in order to understand the role of interface in phase transition and reinforcement mechanisms; 2) probe the influence of domain heterointerfaces on photocurrents to improve photoefficiences in polymer/CdSe/clay solar films; 3) investigate the influence of controlled environmental conditions on conduction in nanomaterials for sensing applications; 4) study interactions between the human follicle stimulating hormone receptor at the cell membrane with intracellular proteins to better understand receptor dysfunction in infertility; 5) investigate morphological changes during sucrose hydrolysis and fat bloom in chocolates; 6) study the depth of penetration of visual markers (quantum-dots) for painting and architectural conservation; and, 7) extend a suite of novel graphical techniques for short and long range pattern recognition in integrated optical/AFM images.\r\n\r\nThe integrated optical/AFM system will support Union College's long-standing commitment to incorporate undergraduate research experience as an integral part of the curriculum and develop innovative, multidisciplinary research and teaching opportunities through active learning that includes hands-on experience in instrumentation.  The proposed instrument will empower faculty research and programs that feature bridges between courses and research laboratories.  Enhanced student expertise with key materials characterization techniques will promote professional development and open career opportunities in science and technology.  Union College is committed to including students from traditionally underrepresented groups in research and educational projects using the proposed instrument and other major research instrumentation. The proposed instrument will be an integral part of the ongoing dynamic outreach programs that use frontiers of science and technology to engage the general public through applications including arts, food science, and their 'Physical Constants' workshop designed for high school students and teachers.",
