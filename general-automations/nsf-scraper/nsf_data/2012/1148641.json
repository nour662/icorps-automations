 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Professor Jon Fukuto of Sonoma State University to elucidate the chemical interactions of H2S with a variety of likely and possible biological targets.  It is proposed by the Fukuto lab that an important fate of biologically generated H2S is the formation of protein persulfides (RSSH).  From a chemical perspective, persulfides are expected to have unique properties that can alter thiol protein function in ways unknown with other thiol-modifed species.  Thus, the generation of persulfides in proteins and subsequent effects on protein function may be an important aspect of H2S biology/signaling.  Significantly, the ephemeral nature of persulfides may also be an important aspect of their physiological utility and, interestingly, would have precluded their discovery or recognition as a biologically relevant species.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include the exposure of undergraduate students to interdisciplinary research in Chemical Biology.  Moreover,  fundamental biochemical studies of H2S  are expected to have impact on the broader scientific community. It appears that NO and CO, together with H2S, constitute an integrated and intimately intertwined signaling system of volatile \"second messengers\".  That is, reported commonality in biological targets and possible chemical interactions indicates a chemical signaling \"web\".  Thus, information on H2S-signaling mechanisms is expected to contribute to the understanding of this network of gaseous low molecular weight signaling species.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary goal of this project was to delineate and characterize the chemistry of hydropersulfides since it was initially hypothesized by us that these species may be formed in the body and possess important physiological function.  The results of the studies performed in this project provide support for the idea that persulfides are important physiological mediators and bioregulators.  The current level of understanding of persulfide chemistry and biochemistry predict that these species may be important for the protection of cells from a variety of stresses.  Importantly, we?ve discovered that levels of persulfides in cells correlate with the resistance of cells to certain toxic agents.  As such, persulfide formation (or lack of) can play a role in the etiology of degenerative diseases, aging and even in the proliferation of cancers.  We have found, for example, that persulfides are generated when cells are exposed to toxins and that the chemistry of the persulfides predicts that they will be capable of scavenging toxic agents and protecting proteins and other cellular components from destruction.  Importantly, persulfide generation will cease (or be downregulated) when cells are no longer under stress conditions.  Thus, the potential role of persulfides in staving off disease or even in protecting cancer cells from immune surveillance makes the persulfide generating systems possible important, novel and as yet un-explored therapeutic targets for a wide range of diseases/disorders ranging from the protection against neurodegenerative disease to the treatment of cancers.  The work performed in this project is extremely fundamental and basic and should provide the basis for future studies aimed at examining the possible role of persulfides as signaling and protective agents in biology (especially in disease).  To be sure, the ideas emanating from these studies represent a significant addition to what is known/thought regarding the role of sulfur species in biological signaling and cell viability.  It is anticipated that future studies in this area will test these ideas in more sophisticated biological systems to determine their validity.               \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/09/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jon Fukuto"
