 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry supports research by Professor Liu of Duke University on the growth mechanism of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNTs can be either metallic or semiconducting depending on their detailed molecular structures. The metallic and semiconducting nanotubes are suitable for very different applications. The growth of either pure metallic or semiconducting CNTs has been very challenging. Obtaining specific types (either metallic or semiconducting) of CNTs is critical for the realization of next-generation carbon nanotube-based nanoscale electronics. Over the last decade, significant efforts in research have been focused on selective growth of type-specific nanotubes but only limited progress has been made. Recently, there  have been important breakthroughs in experimental observations, by the PIs and other research groups, that selective growth of semiconducting carbon nanotubes is possible. The underlying mechanism for such selective growth is still not clear and more experimental proofs and theoretical modeling is needed to complete and confirm the mechanism. This proposal will produce new knowledge on how to grow pure semiconducting carbon nanotubes suitable for electronic devices. In this proposed program, the PI will work closely with theoreticians to study the chemistry during and after the growth of carbon nanotubes. The researchers will study the differences between metallic and semiconducting nanotubes in terms of nucleation energy, growth rate, etc. Based on the experimental results, the researchers will build up deep understanding on the mechanism of the growth selectivity. The results from this research will enable wide range of carbon nanotube technological applications including nanoelectronics, bio- and chemical sensors. Students at all levels will be engaged in the project.",
