 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rutland High School (RHS) in socio-economically diverse Rutland, Vermont, is piloting a new program for engaging upper level high school students in learning about Earth system science through integration of chemistry, physics, biology, and technology in classroom- and field-based experiences.  A new semester-long course called \"New England Landscapes: A Field Based Study of Local Geology through Chemistry, Biology and Physics\" is helping students develop the critical thinking, problem solving, observation, and science writing skills that will engage them in the geosciences and better prepare them for the collegiate level.  This course, which emphasizes instruction and use of field methods and introduction to local geology, is being road-tested by 24 students. The course incorporates multiple weekend and day-long field excursions through-out the New England region, during which students engage in hands-on implementation of the methods they learn in the classroom.  Through the Year End Studies (YES) plan program, half of these students participate in a two and a half-week, intensive opportunity to conduct authentic research, building on individual research proposals developed during the semester course.  This abbreviated semester provides a focused enrichment opportunity for students especially interested in the geosciences.  During that time, students will return to the field to collect relevant samples and data, utilize collaborator Princeton University's laboratory space for sample analysis, and produce a final paper on their findings.  Evaluation activities during the pilot phase are being used to identify the potential of the program to serve as a model that could be replicated elsewhere.",
