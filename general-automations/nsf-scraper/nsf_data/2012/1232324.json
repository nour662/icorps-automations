We will use diverse techniques from communication theory, sensor design methodologies, distributed algorithms and engineering implementation guidelines in our study. The end result will be design guidelines, distributed algorithms and a practical implementation in the context of the Y2E2 building (at Stanford) and \r\nthe upcoming new zero-energy ECE building (at UIUC). \r\n\r\nBroader impacts:       \r\nThe broader impact is via the development and distribution of a prototype sensor network platform that will enable energy efficient building and also be useful in  effective traffic monitoring and real-time monitoring of structural health for infrastructures.",
