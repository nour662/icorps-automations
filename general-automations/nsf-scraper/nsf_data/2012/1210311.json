 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a long-term comprehensive spectropolarimetric survey of all types of supernovae.  The principal goal of this effort is to improve the understanding of the characteristics and importance of asymmetries in supernova explosions by focusing on the observable evolution.  Polarimetry allows one to probe spatial scales in a supernova that cannot be resolved through direct imaging from earth or space.  Spectropolarimetry further enhances the power of this technique by revealing wavelength dependent variations that may result from optical depth dependent geometries.  In recent years, evidence has grown that nearly all supernovae exhibit departures from spherical symmetry.  These results, together with advances in computing power that enable full three dimensional modeling, are exposing the possibility that asymmetries are not just observable consequences of supernovae, but may in fact be a necessity of the explosion mechanism itself.  The investigators will obtain repeat spectropolarimetry of the brightest core collapse and thermonuclear.  These data will be augmented with both photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy. \r\n\r\nThe project is expected to have an impact on astrophysics as the diagnostic power of polarimetry continues to advance, especially in the era of giant telescopes and time-variable astronomy.  This project will also support a number of outreach and education efforts at each institution and will contribute to the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students.  In addition, Dr. Hoffman will continue her leadership of the Collaborative Research in Astrophysics (CORA) program at the University of Denver.  This program is based on studies that show that participation in group research projects increases retention of female students in scientifically and technically demanding majors.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRoughly once per second in the observable universe, a massive star's inner core implodes under its own weight and then explodes as a supernova, announcing its demise with an optical display that for weeks rivals the combined brilliance of all of the billions of other stars in its parent galaxy.  These explosions synthesize and expel heavy elements, heat the interstellar medium, trigger vigorous bursts of star formation, create neutron stars and sometimes black holes, and produce energetic cosmic rays.  As Carl Sagan famously said, \"We are made of star stuff\", and it is not an exaggeration to say that without supernovae to litter the universe with the raw materials out of which Earth-like planets and, ultimately, people have formed, we would not be here at all. \n\n\nAnd yet we must acknowledge basic ignorance: We do not know how these stars explode.  Conventional wisdom posits a spherical \"shock wave\" that expels the stellar envelope, but how this shock pummels its way out of, and ultimately ejects, the massive stellar envelope, is the flashpoint of controversy --- in computer simulations, spherical shocks inevitably lose too much energy and stall in the envelope, unable to successfully explode the star.  On the other hand, recent computer simulations in which strongly directed jets of material are postulated to be formed during the collapse process have proven very capable of producing robust stellar explosions.  Unlike the conventional model, such an explosion mechanism clearly predicts severe distortions from spherical symmetry.\n\nA basic test to decide between such models thus exists.  Namely, is the explosion spherical?  While simple to pose, this question belies a menacing observational challenge, since all distant supernovae remain point-like in the night sky throughout the critical, early phases of their evolution, so that their geometry can not be discerned by simply imaging the explosion.  Fortunately, there is a measurable property of the light coming from an exploded star that can reveal the fundamental nature of its geometry: Its \"polarization\".  Essentially, the degree of polarization of the light tells us whether the explosion is spherical (i.e., measuring 0% polarization) or not (i.e., measuring some number greater than 0% for the polarization).  In general, larger degrees of polarization represent greater departures from spherical symmetry.\n\nThis project -- a collaboration among San Diego State University (SDSU), the University of Arizona, and the University of Denver -- sought to systematically measure the polarization levels for all \"types\" of stellar explosions.  In all, nearly 100 supernovae were analyzed.  The main focus of the PI's group at SDSU was to continue their investigations those arising from \"red supergiant\" stars (like the star Betelgeuse in the shoulder of the constellation Orion), in an effort to better understand the nature of the explosion mechanism itself. This type of supernovae is referred to as \"Type II-Plateau\" (II-P), and we were thus essentially seeking the answer to the question: \"Are Type II-P Supernovae Round\"?\nUnder this project, we obtained new polarization data on 24 of the closest (and, hence, brightest) Type II-P supernovae.  The result? Nearly all of them revealed fundamental evidence for asymmetry in the explosion.  While the degree and timing of the polarization indicated stronger asymmetries further out in the explosion for some events than for others, the detailed polarization characteristics were remarkably similar, one event to the next.  In tandem with our observations, detailed computer modeling was also carried out, and the results suggest a generic, and asymmetric, explosion mechanism -- i.e., one that is the same for all events. What this precise mechanism is is the subject of intense investigation going forward, but all such models are now subject to the constraint that the mechanism must break spherical symmetry.\n\nMost of the polarimetric observations carried out under this project were obtained using the 61-inch Kuiper Telescope, the 90-inch Bok Telescope, and the 6.5-m Multiple Mirror Telescope, all located in Arizona.  However, a crucial component of the data -- namely, the \"lightcurves\" of the supernovae -- were obtained using the PI's home institution's Mount Laguna Observatory (MLO), which employs a modest 40-inch telescope to essentially take (filtered) images of the supernovae during the several months when they are being intensely scrutinized by the larger telescopes in Arizona.  This part of the project formed the backbone of several undergraduate and Master's student theses, and also established the photometric capabilities of the MLO 40-inch telescope at both optical and near-infrared wavelengths.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas C Leonard"
