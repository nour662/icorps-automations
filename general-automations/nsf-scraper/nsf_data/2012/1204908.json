 "awd_abstract_narration": "Creating Plastics Technology Career Pathways in Rural Michigan is advancing plastics technology and plastics workforce development throughout Michigan. The project is linking Mid Michigan Community College with community and industry leaders, the Clare-Gladwin Regional Educational Service District and Ferris State University to ensure that students are progressing incrementally toward academic credentials and sustainable employment in the local plastics industry.   The project's strategies are addressing gaps in current education and training programs by: 1) formalizing an industrial alliance to provide curriculum assistance, career awareness, and workforce experience; 2) developing a non-credit training credential, an academic certificate, and an associates degree with seamless transferability into a bachelors degree in plastics engineering technology, and 3) recruiting and retaining students into a laddered program that provides an array of hands-on and work experience options as well as the integration of entrepreneurial instruction into the curriculum. This innovative approach is addressing issues surrounding the state's manufacturing industries: overt competition among companies for qualified employees, an aging workforce, a shortage of applicants and incumbents with necessary skills, and a pervasive stigma about manufacturing careers. This project is serving as a model to other rural industries, demonstrating that progress can be made through collaborative, proactive strategies.  The project is also enhancing the capacity of educational systems at all levels, comprehensively approaching workforce needs, broadening participation by under-represented women, and building entrepreneurs who are reinvigorating the region's economy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur project; Creating Plastics Technology Career Pathways in Rural Michigan at Mid Michigan Community College has been an exciting opportunity for us to work collaboratively with area manufacturers to develop a unique laddered program from noncredit to an associate?s degree level program of study at MMCC.  This degree now articulates to 3 other in State universities and their varied engineering degrees.\n\nIn addition to the creation and delivery of our program to cohorts at every level of the developed plastics program, we?ve reached students throughout the region and continue to see great interest from in and outstate entities in the program and in hiring our program participants.  In addition, we continue to build on the momentum and curriculum of our NSF project to develop an integrated manufacturing model that will allow our occupation students to delve into a variety of occupational programs, including plastics before determining their area of concentration. \n\nOur program has also boosted ample opportunity for our students to be engaged with local manufacturers at a variety of levels.  From showcasing their talents at a student led open house, to assisting with K-12 student visits to campus and now leading the first chapter of the Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE) in the region. \n\nMMCC students will also be working with staff to collaborate with local school districts in the delivery of a newly developed Day of Plastics Learning; a dive into strengthening STEM awareness and hands on learning opportunities.  The day of learning will incorporate visits to local manufacturers and to one of the regions learning centers that houses the locally developed plastics Hall of Honor the Beaverton Activity Center.   http://beavertonactivitycenter.com/content/plastics  .  The plastics program, through staff and student participation has also had its hand in the development of the Hall displays.  Finally, the students will delve into curriculum developed by the SPE, building on manufacturing day, rounded out by oral and written presentations on the industry.\n\nCollaborative efforts continue with local manufacturers at many levels.  From program donations, to advisory board participation and work on special projects, we have fully engaged our partners.  We have several exciting new projects in the works and are looking forward to exciting opportunities for students and continuing to serve local employer needs aimed at their retention and growth.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lenard S Govitz"
