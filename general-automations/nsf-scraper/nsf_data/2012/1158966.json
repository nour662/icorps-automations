 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. \r\n\r\nThis award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. Amanda I. Banet to work with Dr. Scott G. Hinch at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, sockeye salmon have experienced temperature and water velocities during migration that are higher than their historical average.  This project examines the influence that the maternal environment during migration has on offspring swimming ability in migratory sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Recent work shows that sockeye salmon females that are physiologically stressed upon arrival at spawning grounds produce offspring with impaired swimming performance, which in turn can reduce migration success and make them more vulnerable to predation. This research disentangles the effects of maternal identity, external environment (migration conditions), and internal environment (stress hormones in utero) on offspring swimming performance by using offspring reared from females that experienced natural migrations, simulated migrations, and simulated maternal hormone treatments. Three main hypotheses are addressed: (1) High levels of maternal stress have persistent negative effects on offspring swimming performance, (2) maternal effects on offspring performance have an environmental component, and (3) deleterious maternal effects are exaggerated under stressful conditions.\r\n\r\nThis project examines genotype by environment interactions and intergenerational effects in a rapidly changing habitat. Maternal effects are widely recognized in biology, but few studies have examined them in the context of changing climate and anthropogenic habitat degradation. Results from this project will contribute to the fields of evolutionary biology, ecology, conservation biology, and physiology.\r\n\r\nTraditional management and conservation of migratory fish populations has relied primarily on facilitating reproduction. However, if deleterious maternal effects caused by a difficult migration environment persist into the next generation, then conventional recovery programs may not be enough to ensure the continued health and sustainability of a species. The results of these studies will provide information that will be invaluable to environmental managers making decisions affecting aquatic migratory species.",
