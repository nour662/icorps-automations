 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has produced 5 inverse femtobarns of collision data to date and the data set is expected to increase to 15 inverse femtobarns by the end of 2012. The University of Washington Experimental Particle Physics group, a member of the ATLAS collaboration, is continuing an ambitious program to take full advantage of the unprecedented discovery potential of the LHC. The research is focused mainly on the search for the mechanism of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB). In the Standard Model (SM) as well as in Supersymmetric (SUSY) extensions of the SM, the Higgs mechanism is the most compelling explanation of EWSB. The Washington research program addresses this open question from two directions: searches for a low-mass SM Higgs and for the neutral SUSY Higgs bosons using decays into tau leptons; and searches for non-standard light Higgs decays to neutral particles that can be long-lived.   In addition to the ATLAS physics program, the group continues to expand its contributions to the ATLAS detector and software. The group designed, built and commissioned a large part of the ATLAS forward muon chambers and has significant responsibilities in the operations and online and offline data quality assurance of the muon system. Group members are active participants in the fabrication of the IBL (Insertable Barrel Layer) for the ATLAS pixel detector and will participate in the IBL installation in 2013-14. The group also continues to be strongly involved in the development of b-quark tagging and muon triggering algorithms and the reconstruction and identification of tau-leptons. \r\n\r\nThe program at the University of Washington provides a significant opportunity for undergraduate training, an important feature given that UW has one of the largest physics undergraduate programs in the country. The group plans to continue its long tradition of involving undergraduates in all aspects of the research work. Washington is also actively engaged in outreach efforts to local high school teachers and students as part of the national QuarkNet program.  Notably, the Washington group has recently opened a new direction in its QuarkNet participation by involving teachers and students in the analysis of ATLAS data. Their commitment to broader education and outreach is also demonstrated by the fact that one of the group's faculty members has recently become a co-principal investigator of QuarkNet at the national level.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe so-called Standard Model (SM) of physics that describes the interactions of the fundamental particles, quarks and leptons, completed by the discovery of the Higgs boson, which is associated with Higgs field that gives mass to the fundamental particles.  It also focused our attention on the many open issues the SM does not address, including dark matter, the matter-antimatter asymmetry of our universe, and the absence of obvious TeV-scale signals of physics not described by the SM until now.  During the period covered by this report, our research effort has focused on searches for physics that goes beyond the Standard Model (BSM). \n\nPart of our research team concentrated on searches for evidence of supersymmetry or SUSY (SUperSYmmetry).  This model predicts a doubling of all of the known fundamental particles and compensates for some serious technical problems of the SM.  Our group made central contributions to the search for evidence of SUSY in the decay of the Higgs boson in the data collected by the ATLAS experiment up to 2014.  No evidence for SUSY was observed, and stringent constraints were placed on various manifestations of SUSY models, several papers published in professional journals and members of our groups presented results at international conferences.\n\nVirtually every extension of the SM that addresses some or many of the issues noted above, either require or include the possibility of long-lived particles that decay in the ATLAS detector far from the point where the LHC protons collide.  Many of these models include couplings of SM particles to particles that reside in a hidden sector that is not accessible except in the very high-energy collisions produced at CERN LHC.  For example, it has been speculated that the dark matter that has no interactions, other than gravitational interactions, with what we call matter in our universe belongs to a hidden sector and was trapped here as the universe expanded and cooled.  Part of our group has focused on searches for evidence of long-lived particles in the ATLAS detector.  Our group developed special criterial to select candidate interactions and developed algorithms to reconstruct the decay point (vertex) for candidate displaced decay events.  We did a thorough search in the entire data collected by ATLAS up to 2014 and found no evidence of displaced decays or long-lived Particles.  We interpreted this null result in terms of several theoretical proposals for long-lived particles and set stringent constraints on the existence of such particles produced in proton-proton collisions at center of mass energies of 8 TeV.\n\nWe intend to continue our searches for evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model in the upcoming LHC Run-2 where the proton-proton center of mass energy will increase to 13 TeV.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/11/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Henry J Lubatti"
