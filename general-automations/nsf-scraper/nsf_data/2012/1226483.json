 "awd_abstract_narration": "Creating Tools to Map Global Network Structures\r\n\r\n    The project aims to advance methodological, descriptive, and theoretical knowledge of variations in\r\nhuman societies on a global scale. Methodologically, the project will develop accessible data collection,\r\nmanagement, and analysis tools for mapping network topology at the national level. In addition, the project\r\nwill develop statistically valid and efficient methods for comparing social networks that differ in size \r\nand density. \r\n    Descriptively, as the first comparative mapping of global social networks, the project will provide \r\na more detailed and comprehensive picture of the similarities and differences in patterns of\r\nsocial interaction across countries with diverse cultures, political systems, mobility patterns, and\r\nlevels of economic development. \r\n    Theoretically, the project will address fundamental questions about social and structural differences \r\nbetween countries with different network topologies. The project will draw upon widely used cross-national\r\nmeasures of individualism and collectivism to test hypothesized structural differences between the US, UK, China \r\nand Korea. The findings will catalyze theoretical and methodological dialog between network\r\nscientists in disciplines that emphasize universals (e.g. statistical mechanics)and variations (e.g. \r\ncross-cultural studies in sociology and anthropology).\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n    This project will have broad applications: 1)for the spread of pathogens and public health countermeasures,\r\n2) for policy research on the economic and cultural correlates of the \"digital divide\",3) for market\r\nresearch on the diffusion of innovations, 4) for social movement research on \"domino effects\" like those\r\nobserved in the cascading collapse of the former Soviet Union and more recently in the Arab Spring,\r\nand 5) comparative studies of social capital and economic development. Computer scientists will benefit\r\nfrom comparative data that may be helpful for tailoring the design of online social network\r\nsites. Network scientists will have access to a rich new source of social network data on a global scale. Finally, the\r\ndevelopment and dissemination of effective methods to collect, manage, analyze, and compare\r\nmultiple networks of hundreds of millions of nodes will constitute a significant contribution to the\r\nsocial science community, especially when coupled with technical education and training of social\r\nscience undergraduate and graduate students to effectively utilize research tools and\r\ndistributed/parallel computing frameworks for analyzing very large datasets.",
