 "awd_abstract_narration": "No single discipline has sufficient breadth of perspective and tools to address the societal challenges posed by crime, violence, and lawlessness. Yet currently there is no adequate forum for creating a sustained inter-disciplinary community of researchers to address these issues and train new scholars to adopt this broader perspective. A second problem is that while some of the most cost-effective alternatives to incarceration may include efforts to address human capital deficits and change the social environment, research on those issues too often ignores crime-related outcomes. A third limitation is that research on crime tends to be provincial, and ignores potential insights from variation in policy or social conditions within or across other countries.  This proposal is to establish a research coordination network (RCN) that would seek to create an international inter-disciplinary network of researchers to study these issues, and which would include: annual meetings to discuss new research; a training component via an interdisciplinary cohort of pre-doctoral and post-doctoral \"NSF / NBER fellows\" to help organize the meetings and actively participate; a data component through which fellows would identify new data sources to add to the those available on the NBER websites and other sources; and a dissemination component that leverages the outstanding capacities of the NBER website.  \r\n\r\nThe scientific benefits will flow from shared data and research methods, new research collaborations across disciplines and nations, the expanded consideration of crime-related outcomes in conjunction with the cost-benefit evaluation of social programs, and mentorship of junior researchers. New knowledge generated from this process will serve the public interest in reducing criminal behavior at lowest possible social cost.",

The NSF grant has enabled us to bring in non-economists and economists working outside of the U.S., and to involve junior researchers and those from under-represented groups.\n\n \n\nWe appointed a diverse group of two dozen graduate students and post-doctoral fellows as NSF/NBER Crime Research Fellows during 2012 and 2013.  That program was replaced in 2014 by a less formal program of welcoming graduate students to attend sessions if recommended by their advisors.  The Fellows have now taken career positions in Universities and are among the leading young \"crime and criminal justice\" scholars in several disciplines.\n\n \n\nWe held a total of four two-day workshops at the NBER summer institute, in July 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.  These workshops each involved 14 papers selected from scores of submissions.  We included some of the Fellows in every workshop as presenters, and assigned senior scholars to serve as their discussants.  Other presenters, discussants, and the audience included a number of foreign scholars at our invitation, which has helped provide stronger international linkages to the burgeoning \"economics of crime\" field and introduce the younger scholars to the foreign leaders of this field.  Finally, we were able to integrate a number of non-economist social scientists into the program,  One memorable session has psychologist Kenneth Dodge paried with Nobel Laureate James Heckman for a fascinating exchange on early childhood influences on criminal behavior. \n\n \n\nThe grant has also supported the creation of new data resources.
