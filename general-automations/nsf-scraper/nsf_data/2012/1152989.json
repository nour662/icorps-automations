 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemical Catalysis Program, Professor Clark R. Landis from University of Wisconsin at Madison will advance the state-of-the-art of catalysis through the design and synthesis of novel organophosphine compounds, 3,4-diazaphospholanes. Efficient, selective, and atom economical transformations catalyzed by chiral transition metal complexes represent a critical technology for cost-effective and environmentally-benign synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. This project addresses the intellectual challenges of (1) creating chiral catalyst environments with diverse collections of functional groups using modular and bead-based syntheses (2) understanding how enantioselectivity and activity are controlled in hydroformylation reactions and (3) implementing enantioselective catalysis by organic chemists at both the bench and industrial plant scales through extension of enantioselective hydroformylation to new substrate classes, reaction conditions, and the incorporation of enantioselective hydroformylation into multistep syntheses.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the scientific impact this work will support the competitiveness of U. S. chemical and pharmaceutical industries through the development of efficient, low-waste processes and through the training of undergraduate and graduate students for careers in science, technology, and engineering fields.",

This project advances the state-of-the-art of enantioselective, transition-metal catalyzed transformations through the design and synthesis of novel organophosphine compounds, 3,4-diazaphospholanes.  Efficient, selective, and atom economical transformations catalyzed by chiral transition metal complexes represent a critical technology for the synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products.

(Nine of the top ten selling prescription pharmaceuticals are sold as enantiomerically pure compounds.) This impact is real; chiral diazaphospholanes from this project were made available through Aldrich chemical so that researchers could apply them to asymmetric hydroformylation and related transformations. \nThe application of asymmetric hydroformylation to a variety of substrates with simple equipment and mild conditions prompted a collaboration with Eli Lilly Company, a major pharmaceutical producer.  This collaboration resulted in novel flow processes for practical use of asymmetrich hydroformylation in a pharmaceutical production environment.  \nA second area of broad impact concerns new methods for creating collections of chiral phosphines ligands that bear diverse functional groups. These new ligands enable the creation of microenvironments around catalytically active metal sites that mimic many of the characteristics of metalloenzymes.  Access to such environments will inspire new generations of highly selective and active catalytic transformations.  \nIntellectual Merit.\n\nAlthough hydroformylation is a robust, commodity scale processes, the development of enantioselective versions for pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals is a long-standing challenge.  This project addresses the challenges of creating chiral catalyst, demonstrating their effectiveness in asymmetric hydroformylation, and understanding how they work.\n\nThe first intellectual challenge addressed by this project is to demonstrate that the novel class of ligands developed by the Landis group, 3,4-diazaphospholanes, can be implemented by organic chemists to make more efficient processes.   High priority was given to hydroformylation reactions that yield precursors to aryl propionic acids, alpha- and beta-amino acids, alpha- and beta-hydroxyaldehydes, chiral four-membered rings, fluorinated aldehydes, and aldehydes with quaternary stereocenters.  In each case success was achieved with enantioselectivities &gt;90% ee, near complete conversion, very high regioselectivity, and catalyst turnover numbers exceeding 200 but reaching 350,000 is some cases.  Such results led to an collaboration with Eli Lilly Company that sought to develop new flow reactor technology that could achieve, as a demonstration, practical production of the analgesic Naproxen via hydroformylation.    An important outcome of this work is the demonstration that asymmetric hydroformylation can be performed practically within a pharmaceutical synthesis environment.\n\nSuccessful hydroformylation of chiral alpha-amino and -acetoxy aldehydes suggested the possibility that new processes for making condensation oligomers (peptides and oligoesters) with sequence specificity, near complete atom economy, and the catalytic introduction of all stereogenic centers can be achieved.  The outcome is a completely novel process that can be applied to sequence specific polymers with extraordinary atom economy because no protecting groups or coupling reagents are used.\n\nThe second intellectual challenge focuses on synthetic aspects of 3,4-diazaphospholanes: can they be expanded to include catalyst immobilization, rapid synthesis of diverse libraries of new ligands, and the elucidation of structural features that control selectivity?  It is simple to immobilize the ligands on the resin beads commonly used for peptide synthesis.  Catalysts immobilized on such resins exhibit good recyclability and selectivity and activity that are near identical to the homogeneous catalysts.  Furthermore, similar chemistry can be used to create libraries of peptide-functionalized ligands. The catalyst selectivity depends on the structure of the peptide, thus catalysts can be optimized for a specific transformation quickly and simply. \n\nSynthetic modifications of 3,4-diazaphospholanes that modulate the ?puckering? of the five-membered ring result in significant variation of hydroformylation selectivity with more ?puckered? rings yielding higher selectivity.  \n\nThe overall outcomes of these synthetic activities is realization that 3,4-diazaphospholanes enable catalyst immobilization, rapid creation of ligand libraries, and structure-based control of hydroformylation regioselectivity.\n\nThe last intellectual challenge concerns creating deeper understanding of how catalysts achieve high selectivity. Deep mechanistic studies focus on characterization of the overall rate law for enantioselective hydroformylation, trapping and characterization of key intermediates, and determination of the kinetics of the elementary steps that, taken together, constitute the catalytic cycle.   WiHP-NMRR, an operando NMR instrument developed in the Landis group, allows catalytic reactions to be followed at high pressure and with fast gas-liquid mixing.  The result is that a detailed, and rare, microkinetic model of hydroformylation was created; this model elucidates important insights into the roles of shunted and direct pathways for selectivity control.  The outcomes of these efforts are detailed knowledge of how catalysts work and proven procedures for determining microkinetic models of catalysis. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Clark R Landis"
