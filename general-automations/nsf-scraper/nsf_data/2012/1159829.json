 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET - 1159829\r\nFu\r\n\r\nThis NSF award by the Chemical and Biological Separations program supports work by Professors Xiao-an Fu, Richard Higashi, and Michael Nantz to investigate a microfabricated reactor for analysis of trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air and human breath. The analysis of human breath holds promise as a powerful noninvasive diagnostic tool for many diseases including lung cancer, tuberculosis, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Breath is a mixture of air, carbon dioxide, water, and a large number of trace VOCs and non-volatile organic compounds. The analysis of breath VOCs could lead to the discovery of metabolic biomarkers of a large number of lung diseases and fulfilling breath analysis as a noninvasive diagnostic tool.\r\n\r\nThe principal objective of this project is to investigate a chemoselective preconcentration approach for quantitative analysis of trace carbonyl VOCs in air and human breath. Carbonyl VOCs in air are directly related to air quality, while carbonyl VOCs in human breath are relatable to oxidative damage from diseases. Some carbonyl VOCs could be used as cancer biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer. The proposed novel microreactors have microfluidic channels and micropillars coated with custom-synthesized compounds for capturing and concentrating trace carbonyl VOCs via unique chemical reactions. Chemically selective reactions of the custom-synthesized micropillar coatings with carbonyl VOCs solve many interference problems encountered in breath analyses. The innovation of this project is development of microreactors that have unique microstructures and surfaces to take full advantage of the custom-synthesized compounds for chemoselective capture of trace carbonyl compounds in air and human breath. The microreactors fabricated by microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies provide considerable advantages, such as multiple highly reproducible production, much lower cost, and a microfluidic scale that is intrinsically well-suited for nanoelectrospray Fourier-transform-ion-cyclotron-resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) analysis. The proposed study of the effects of the microreactor microstructure and the selectivity and reaction kinetics of the synthesized compounds on the capture efficiencies of trace carbonyl compounds will provide fundamental chemical engineering knowledge for future development of microreactors for trace VOC separation and detection.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this research is directly linked to high-priority national environment and healthcare issues. This collaborative research program in the same institution will allow us to establish a multidisciplinary undergraduate and graduate education and training program. The PIs are committed to utilize this research opportunity to recruit and train undergraduate and graduate students from under-represented groups. The interdisciplinary nature of this project provides excellent opportunities for the PIs to disseminate chemical microsystem technologies and demonstrate novel breath analysis method to K-12 grade students and their science teachers through the university outreach programs. The PIs also plan to recruit local high school students to do their science projects for participating Louisville Regional and the State of Kentucky Science Fairs.",
