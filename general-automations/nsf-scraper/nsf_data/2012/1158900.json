 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will provide support for an Intensive Workshop for Macaulay2 Development, to be held on August 5th-9th, 2012 at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC. Approximately 30 researchers will attend the workshop.  The main objective is to implement algorithms in the following three rapidly growing areas: enumerative geometry, numerical algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and algebraic statistics.  These areas have significant applications in fields as diverse as computational biology, data analysis, statistics, and theoretical physics.  It is the expectation, therefore, that the packages developed through this workshop will advance our knowledge and understanding across multiple disciplines.  Some emphasis will also be placed on enhancing the multithreaded capabilities of Macaulay2.\r\n\r\nMacaulay2 is one of the leading computer algebra systems for research and teaching in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. The ability to perform increasingly complicated computations in more areas of these two fields continues to revolutionize both research in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, and the breadth of the applications of these fields to other areas of research.  Most of the other related computer algebra systems are based in foreign countries and continued competitiveness of Macaulay2, a leading United States--based program, depends on both a broad community contributing to its development and the funding to support this community through intensive workgroup meetings.\r\n\r\nThe participation of both experienced and novice researchers from a variety of institutions is crucial to the work of these workshops. These intensive workshops are also a great opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to enhance their package-writing skills early in their careers, taking advantage of the experience and research expertise of the more senior researchers as well as sharing their own expertise with the group.  A strong presence from young researchers also helps the base of mathematicians programming for Macaulay2 to grow over time. Travel and lodging support for these workshops are critical to both the intensive nature of the workshop and to the future development of Macaulay2.",
