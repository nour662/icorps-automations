The funds will be used to help support young scientists from US institutions to enable them to attend the school.\r\n\r\nThe school aims to serve as a broad introduction to neutrino physics that covers both accelerator and non-accelerator neutrino experiments, both neutrino properties and neutrino interactions, and both theory and experiment. The goal of this series is to train the next generation of neutrino physicists, and the curriculum covers many topics: introductions to both the Standard Model and oscillation phenomenology, accelerator and reactor neutrinos, neutrino cross sections, and neutrinos in cosmology, just to name a few. \r\n\r\nFor Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students. The target audience consists of graduate students and recent post-docs in both theory and experiment.",
