On the value of this activity alone, the broader impacts of these activities continues to be a prime reason for continuing the records activities in one form or another. A legacy of the University of Wisconsin efforts in this arena enables continuity of the data collection and archival efforts. Outreach activities to the (Wisconsin) public and efforts to engage (Wisconsin) K-12 school children and their teachers will also be continued.",
