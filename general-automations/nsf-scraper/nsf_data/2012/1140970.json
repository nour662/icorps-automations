 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aquatic vegetation in fresh- and salt-water systems provides ecosystem services valued at over one trillion dollars per year.  Seagrass and freshwater macrophytes enhance water quality by filtering nutrients from the water, reducing re-suspension, and producing oxygen in stagnant regions.  Unlike terrestrial plants, which acquire nutrients through their roots, aquatic plants acquire essential nutrients through their leaves and blades from the surrounding water.  The nutrient uptake controls the growth and health of the vegetation, as well as its potential impact on water quality.  The proposed research will examine how the hydrodynamic conditions and the motion of individual blades impacts the rate of nutrient flux to the plant, with the goal of providing better predictions of the potential maximum uptake rate.  \r\n\r\nThe project will examine the interaction of individual blades with uni-directional current and progressive waves to understand how blade motion influences flux to the blade surface.  The model blades will be constructed from low-density polyethylene (LDPE), which preferentially absorb the organic compounds present in our flume water (e.g. chloroform).  Because of its high partitioning coefficient, for an initial period of exposure, the LDPE blade takes in chemicals as fast as it can be delivered to the surface, mimicking mass-transport limiting uptake. This project will extend existing models for flux at solid boundaries to conditions relevant to macrophytes, specifically introducing the impact of blade motion and conditions with waves.  It will contribute a basic understanding of mass exchange at flexible boundaries that is relevant to chemical and biological engineering.",

Seagrass and freshwater macrophytes enhance water quality by filtering nutrients from the water, damping waves and reducing re-suspension of bed sediments, and producing oxygen in stagnant regions. Unlike terrestrial plants, which acquire nutrients through roots, aquatic plants can acquire nutrients through their leaves and blades from the surrounding water. The nutrient uptake controls the growth and health of the vegetation, as well as its potential impact on water quality. Because the blade and leaves are flexible, they change shape and move when the water around them is in motion. This is called reconfiguration. This project described how the blade geometry and the blade material properties (density and rigidity) influence the reconfiguration of vegetation in both currents and waves, and developed models to predict the reconfiguration. Further, this project determined how the movement of blades in current and waves changes the rate of nutrient flux to the plant. As part of this effort, the project developed new experimental methods to study fluid-structure interaction and its impact on scalar flux between the fluid and moving elements. The project also developed a model to predict the maximum potential nutrient flux to the plant under different flow conditions. The model was validated by comparison to field measurements in real meadows of seagrass. By improving the physical description of how aquatic vegetation acquires nutrients from the water, this project will enable better regional modeling of vegetation productivity and the impact of submerged grasses on water quality and nursery habitat. Finally, by quantifying the impact of flow on uptake potential, the models could guide the choice of optimum flow conditions within treatment wetlands.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/30/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Heidi&nbsp;M&nbsp;Nepf</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1140970/1140970_10159066_1490888432127_Blades.in.waves--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1140970/1140970_10159066_1490888432127_Blades.in.waves--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Single Model Blade Through Wave Cycle\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1140970/1140970_10159066_1490888432127_Blades.in.waves--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Single Model Blade Through Wave Cycle\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The motion of an individual seagrass blade model through a wave cycle.
