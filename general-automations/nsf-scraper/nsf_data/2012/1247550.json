 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research project is designed to identify, synthesize, and characterize novel neurotoxins from the venom of terebrid marine snails (teretoxins) in a high throughput manner. A biodiversity centered toxin discovery strategy, coupled with innovative mass spectrometric techniques, will be used to expedite the discovery of novel teretoxin peptide sequences. Identified teretoxins will then be immobilized via an oligosaccharide glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linker on solid support to form a teretoxin-GPI microarray. The ability to access teretoxins in a microarray format facilitates the discovery of ligands for probing the mechanics and functional activity of ion channels in neuronal circuits. The specific objectives of this research proposal are to: 1) Discover novel teretoxins using charged-enhanced electron-transfer dissociation mass spectrometry techniques. 2) Synthesize teretoxin-GPI chimeras using several chemical synthesis strategies, and 3) Develop a teretoxin-GPI neuropeptide microarray to do high throughput screening of ion channel ligands. The successful completion of these research objectives would produce a systematic approach, with broad appeal for identifying cysteine-rich neurotoxins from the enormous peptide toxin libraries of scorpions, snakes, and spiders, in addition to marine snails, and develop a neurotoxin microarray for high throughput screening of ion channel ligands, a fundamental advance in the characterization of the neuronal circuit. \r\n\r\n The proposed education initiative will develop and implement an undergraduate laboratory research program termed, RAISE-W (Research Assisted Initiatives in Science Empowerment for Women) that is geared towards increasing and retaining the number of women, especially underrepresented women, engaged in scientific research in STEM disciplines. Key barriers for retaining women in STEM fields are perceived stereotypes and a lack of skills for successfully balancing career/family pressures. RAISE-W will build the foundation for overcoming these obstacles. The components of the RAISE-W program are to: 1) Identify and recruit qualified undergraduate women at The City University of New York (CUNY) who will be paired with CUNY faculty to engage in scientific research projects.  2) Provide a \"coaching regime\" that teaches program participants skills in time management, achievement, and career development. 3) Support graduate school activities via a research proposal award, ensuring the participants stay on the STEM track.",

RAISEW program participants are paired with executive coaches to identify and eliminate barriers to their success, similar to what is offered to corporate CEOs. Over one hundred female undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral and pre-tenure faculty participated in the five year tenure of this award. On the whole, RAISEW participants expressed stronger agreement after participation in RAISEW that their family, friends, and others supported their ambition and interest to become a scientist.
