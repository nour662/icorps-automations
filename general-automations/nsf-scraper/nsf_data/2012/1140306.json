The environment has an embedded intelligent agent coupled with an intelligent tutoring system and offers an alternative experimentation experience at institutions that do not have a physical machines laboratory. Students are using the virtual laboratory as a safe test bed to garner experience prior to encountering machines in a real laboratory. The software offers an intelligent agent-based virtual instructor that represents an expert in the power field. The instructor answers questions, provides guidance and supervises the virtual laboratory - when specifically requested by the student.\r\n \r\nThe graphical user interface (GUI) enables students to simulate various electrical machines and drives described by differential equations, without requiring students to develop computer programs. The intuitive and simple-to-use GUI is based on detailed numerical methods (for the simulation), which is entirely transparent to the users. The environment allows students to learn the basics of electric machines, while they test, analyze and design them. The GUI allows users to modify any machine \"on-the-fly\" by entering a new set of machine parameters, such as resistors, inductors, inertia, etc. Advanced users also have the ability to define their own mathematical model of an electrical machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROADER SIGNIFICANCE\r\nThe project is developing an intelligent tutoring system that is engaging, adaptable, and tailors instruction to individual learners. The virtual laboratory increases the number of students who can experience the challenges and excitement of power engineering. The system offers the potential for reaching a diverse range of students who might not otherwise have access to equipment or are discouraged from entering a physical laboratory. The effort also helps address safety concerns of students that might avoid taking power engineering courses because of the high currents and voltages encountered in the labs.",
