 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CLEAR-VMI research group seeks support to study the following objectives: (1) development of a low nitrogen genetically enhanced biomass species for use as a reduced nutrient emission alternative energy production fuel source; (2) elemental characterization of low nitrogen biomass species to develop full-scale emission predictions; (3) real-time laboratory and field level emission analysis of enhanced biomass species for determination and validation of reduced atmospheric nitrogen loads; and (4) three-dimensional community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) modeling of measured biomass emissions to quantify resulting nitrogen deposition within the Chesapeake Bay. Also, as an educational component, our group seeks to enhance the professional presentation and communication skills of our student researchers through an added rhetorical development objective. Experiments will involve the development of a genetically modified biomass capable of producing low nitrogen (N) emissions. Through accelerated stem senescence, the CLEAR group proposes to remobilize N to the seeds, creating a more nutritious crop yield for consumption and leaving low N content stems and leaves for use in alternative power and fuel production.",
