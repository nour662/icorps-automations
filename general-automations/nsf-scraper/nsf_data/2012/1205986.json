 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors John F. Donoghue and Lorenzo Sorbo at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. \r\n\r\nThe search for new physics beyond our present Standard Model of the fundamental interactions is in an exciting phase at the moment. Both in particle physics and cosmology there are many experimental opportunities and novel theoretical ideas. The research of Profs. Donoghue and Sorbo will explore a range of theoretical topics aimed at understanding and extending our fundamental theories. These include work in quantum field theory in cosmological or gravitational applications, new physics for inflation in the early universe, and tests for unusual features of the underlying physical laws. Attention will be paid to both basic theoretical structure and also interplay with experiment. \r\n\r\nThe project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Profs. Donoghue and Sorbo will involve graduate students in their research, providing critical training for young scientists. Prof. Donoghue is revising his successful book \"Dynamics of the Standard Model\" (with Profs. Golowich and Holstein) which provides a solid grounding in the Standard Model of particle physics. Both Profs. Donoghue and Sorbo also use their expertise in providing science instruction to both undergraduate science students and to non-science students in a general-education setting.",
