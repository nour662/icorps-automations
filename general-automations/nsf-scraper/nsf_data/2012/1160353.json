 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project seeks to better understand how faculty can provide meaningful and effective feedback to engineering students who are engaged in complex design projects.  Providing good and timely feedback can have a significant impact on learning, yet little is known about how to structure or provide effective feedback during team based engineering design projects.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be to help instructors more effectively provide feedback to student engineering teams.  This feedback will broadly support learning, and by targeting instructors can have a disproportionate impact on the number of students affected.  The project also aligns with national priorities in engineering education.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.",

The learning system has been designed to develop students&rsquo; abilities to apply fundamental knowledge and skills to create experimental models and strategies and to work productively in teams. Students teams work on an authentic, industrially-situated task to determine the best (optimal) input parameters for chemical or biological reactors for high-volume manufacturing. The experiments student teams design are performed virtually. Thus, student teams are provided opportunities to practice the complete, iterative cycle of experimental design where they develop and refine solutions through experimentation, analysis, and iteration. Integral to their success is the ability to develop and use models and identify appropriate strategies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In these learning systems, the student-instructor interactions are different from those in traditional classroom settings. Interactions occur throughout students&rsquo; engagement with the learning system. Semi-structured design meetings, which we call <em>coaching sessions </em>are an example of such interactions. These coaching sessions are designed to mirror the structure of industrial design reviews. Student teams take on the role of process development engineers while the instructor acts as mentor and manager. The goal of this research project is to identify the types of feedback that promotes learning as students engage in open ended engineering projects and to cultivate their technical and professional skills through these authentic projects.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Intellectual Merit:</span> The researchers studied factors supporting productive &ldquo;coaching&rdquo; of students by the instructors. They also compared the extent to which virtual and physical engineering laboratories supported disciplinary thinking (modeling) and engagement.

They have described the characteristics of successful feedback and the effects of that feedback on student learning.

The researchers have identified aspects of &ldquo;school&rdquo; learning that may interfere with development of design thinking, as well as aspects of more realistic contexts that facilitate it.

It allows them to integrate the knowledge and skills they have been learning in the curriculum through application towards an authentic project. The understanding of feedback, in principle, is applicable to a wider range of engineering project experiences, such as the capstone projects in most disciplines.
