 "awd_abstract_narration": "In complex applications such as design and feedback control of energy efficient buildings, and  wave or wind energy arrays, existing codes are often available for simulation but these codes are  not always suitable for purposes such as model reduction or feedback control design. The  outcome of this research is a suite of computationally efficient and provably convergent algorithms  for grand challenge problems in PDE model reduction and feedback control.  The proposed work  focuses on two fundamental problem classes: (1) computing approximate solutions of infinite  dimensional Lyapunov and Riccati equations used in feedback control design, and (2) algorithms  for PDE balanced model reduction. This work utilizes specific solution data from PDE systems to  produce provably convergent approximations for PDE model reduction and feedback control  problems. Since the algorithms are data-based, the methods may use existing simulation codes  with specialized discretization schemes and tools such as adaptive solvers, parallel algorithms, and  multigrid methods to increase computational efficiency and accuracy. Since the algorithms can  exploit such advanced simulation techniques, the algorithms can scale to treat highly complex  grand challenge problems.  \r\n\r\nThe accurate solution of model reduction problems for partial differential equation systems is  important for many applications including fast simulations, tractable optimization, feedback control  design, and real time control implementation. Feedback control of PDEs has potential applications  in many areas.  For example, feedback control of air flow in commercial buildings could lead to  dramatic reduction in energy consumption. In another area, feedback control of fluid-structure  interactions in wave energy converters could lead to effective ocean wave energy extraction. The  proposed work primarily considers the development and analysis of model reduction and  feedback control algorithms for linear PDE systems, as extensions of these reduced models and  feedback laws can be used to treat problems involving nonlinear PDEs. The algorithms can exploit  advanced existing simulation codes, and therefore the completion of the proposed work will open  the door for large advances in computational feedback control to challenging nonlinear PDE  systems.",
