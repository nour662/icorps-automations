 "awd_abstract_narration": "Based on the funding from Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program (CSDM) program, Prof. Sivaguru Jayaraman's group at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND will carry out studies pertaining to light induced enantiospecific chiral transfer in solution. Synthesizing chiral compounds with high stereoselectivity during light induced transformations provides an opportunity to develop sustainable strategies with minimal impact on the environment. As part of the investigation the PI will pursue new strategies for stereocontrol in photoreactions to gain a fundamental understanding of interaction of light with matter coupled with an intricate control over molecular reactivity, dynamics and non-bonding interactions to enhance stereoselectivity in the photoproducts.\r\n\r\nThe project development plan seamlessly integrates scientific research, educational training, and public outreach. Students involved in the proposed investigations will learn both traditional techniques to characterize and evaluate asymmetric induction during enantiospecific phototransformations and modern spectroscopic methods and characterization techniques to assess excited state reactivity. The PI plans to engage local high school students through the PICNICS (Parents Involvement with Children, Nurturing Intellectual Curiosity in Science) outreach program that he has developed at North Dakota. The aim of the outreach program is to provide a cutting edge research environment to high school students there by encouraging them to look up to science and math as career paths.",
