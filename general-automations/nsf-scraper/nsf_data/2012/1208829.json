 "awd_abstract_narration": "Herbarium specimens provide a source of historical information useful to the study of global environmental change. The goal of this project is to provide data to support studies of the nature and consequences of environmental change in the New England region over the last three centuries. This project will digitally capture specimen data and images from about 1.3 million vascular plant specimens from herbaria across New England, enhancing the data with georeferencing, habitat, and phonological information. The digitization process will integrate with existing community efforts and will develop novel high-throughput digitization technologies to increase efficiency and decrease costs. All resulting data and images will be freely available on-line.\r\n\r\nThe data from this project will be of immediate use to scientists who study climate and land-use change, and will provide a better understanding of how global changes will impact the distribution of native and introduced plant species. This project will benefit research in taxonomy, ecology, morphology, biogeography, and evolutionary history by making available data on an entire regional flora in an electronic format. The methodologies developed will provide a model for other regions around the nation. In addition the project will utilize citizen scientists, school groups, and students providing training, research, and educational opportunities. . This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

The work was part of a collaborative effort among regional herbaria that was led by Yale University. Each specimen has been digitally imaged. Information on the label has been transcribed including the species name, when and where it was collected, and by whom.  The location information was used to determine the latitude and longitude of the collection site. This allows the distribution of species to be mapped.  Coupled with date information, it is possible to map changes in species distributions over time in response to climate change, disturbances, or the impact of invasive species.  Over 1.3 million digitized specimens from all the herbaria in the projects are accessible through the consortium?s web portal at NEVP.org.  The portal provides a set of tools for searching the collections, displaying high resolution images of each specimen, and mapping species distributions.  The portal is available to researchers, educators, conservation agencies, and anyone else interested in exploring the vascular plants of New England. The portal has been used to examine changes in leaf-out and flowering times for species that result from global warming.  It is used by graduate students and field biologists to help select study sites.  It is used in university botany courses to prepare students for field trips and look at the relationships between habitat and plant community structure.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher D Neefus"
