 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Sustainable Energy pathways (SEP) Program, under the umbrella of the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) initiative, will support the research program of Prof. Sridhar Viamajala and co-workers at the University of Toldeo, Prof. Robin Gerlach and co-workers at Montana State University, and Prof. Gregory Characklis of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This project will focus on high lipid-producing native alkaliphilic algae which are less susceptible to detrimental contamination (due to their extreme growth environment) and able to accumulate large amounts of lipid. In addition, the project will develop and test low-energy options for cell harvesting as well as for fuel and high value product generation. Through integration of unique and robust advances in algal culture stability and productivity as well as research targeted on the critical processes of algae harvesting and conversion of biochemicals, scalable, environmentally and economically acceptable processes to produce renewable fuels and chemicals will be developed. \r\n\r\nThe results of this project will be of interest to industry, local communities, regulators, and academia. Specific outreach efforts will be directed towards each of these primary stakeholders through: (1) dissemination of research outcomes to local community members and industry stakeholders at conferences, trade meetings and by local community and legislator engagement; (2) engagement of underrepresented Native American students from Montana high schools and tribal colleges in summer research activities as well as undergraduate researchers in the PIs' laboratories; (3) education and training at the K-12 level through training of high school teachers; (4) development of an interdisciplinary distance-learning course sequence on \"Sustainable Biofuels\" that will cover broad topics on the fundamental biology, chemistry, engineering and sustainability aspects of biofuel production; (5) generation of information useful in making informed judgments regarding tradeoffs between cost and environmental impact using the results of the life-cycle analyses.\r\n\r\nThis sustainable energy pathway minimizes energy and materials requirements through use of low-energy chemical and biological processes coupled with nutrient and water recycle. The global warming potential (GWP) of such biorefineries would be significantly lowered through the use of energy-efficient cultivation, harvesting and conversion methods as well as by minimizing external demands for nutrients and water.  Overall, these solutions to the challenge of economic and sustainable energy from algae will be transformative through the development of novel scientific and technical advances, balanced with environmental, economic and societal merits.  These algal farms will not compete with arable lands, food production, or use high quality water.",

This research has made significant contributions in the area of algal biofuels with thorough and detailed investigations of the following topics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Microalgae Cultivation</span>: The cost and location constraints posed by concentrated CO<sub>2</sub> supply for cultivation can be avoided by employing microalgae that can grow under combined high pH-high alkalinity conditions (~pH &gt; 10; ~&gt;50 meq L<sup>-1</sup>). These alkaline solutions scavenge atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> at high rates, and in addition, afford natural protection for desired alkaliphilic microalgae cultivars against common competing organisms and predators. In our project we have focused on enrichment, isolation, and characterization of alkaliphilic microalgae. High pH (pH &gt; 10) medium that also contains a high carbonate/bicarbonate alkalinity (&gt;50 meq?L<sup>?1</sup>) simultaneously provides (i) a high driving force to effectively scavenge atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> due to the high medium pH and (ii) nonlimiting bicarbonate concentrations for photosynthetic carbon fixation. We demonstrated the ability of high bicarbonate concentrations to allow for high biomass and lipid productivities. </li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Low Quality Water and Nutrient Sources</span>: This project demonstrated that algae biomass cultivation is possible in low quality water sources (such as non-potable or wastewater) and using low quality nutrient sources (such as sludge from wastewater treatment facilities). Differences in the overall biomass productivity as well as the productivity (and usability) of potentially higher value products (lipids, carbohydrates, pigments, pharmaceuticals, etc.) were found and will have to be taken into account when planning the use of low quality water and nutrient sources for large scale algal biomass production. </li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Importance of Microbial Communities and Interactions</span>: Algal and cyanobacterial (blue-green algal) cultures rarely remain ?pure?, i.e. the original organism rarely remains the only organism present during long-term or industrial-scale cultivation. Hence, it is important to understand and ultimately control community composition in practice to not only reduce detrimental effects but possibly even improve productivity and robustness of algal cultures. Our work has laid the basis for the creation of a beneficial algal microbiome approach that could transform industrial scale algae production. </li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) and Techno-economic Analyses (TEA)</span>: Initial work addressed previously unexplored interactions between technical advances (e.g., alkaliphilic cultivation and hydrogel-based dewatering) and financial subsidies. A second study explored the use of a ?real-options analysis? to help identify algal biofuel plant designs that that remain viable even when the price of key plant inputs and outputs fluctuate over time. A third project explored strategies for using municipal wastewater effluent as a feedstock in algae cultivation. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Taken altogether, the advances in microalgae cultivation, harvest, conversion and analyses of microalgae economics and biorefinery emissions developed during this project will significantly improve the viability of prospective algal biorefineries and cost-competitive production of biofuels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/31/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robin&nbsp;Gerlach</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1230632/1230632_10213439_1559304625153_PW_95_mask_orange_stain_20151112_Luisa_Corredor_Arias--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1230632/1230632_10213439_1559304625153_PW_95_mask_orange_stain_20151112_Luisa_Corredor_Arias--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Alga PW-95 sample stained with Mask Orange\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1230632/1230632_10213439_1559304625153_PW_95_mask_orange_stain_20151112_Luisa_Corredor_Arias--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Alga PW-95 sample stained with Mask Orange\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">EpiFluorescence image of algal strain PW-95 stained with cell mask orange (membrane specific dye) in green; chlorophyll auto-florescence in red.
