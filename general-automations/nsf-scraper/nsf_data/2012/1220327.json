 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brown University doctoral student Paula S. Dias, guided by Dr. Jessaca Leinaweaver, will undertake research on how economic development projects linked to oil extraction affect and illuminate local politics and social dynamics. As some governments delegate development responsiblities to resource extraction corporations as a cost of doing business, the effects of these extraction activities are broadened, often in ways that are unanticipated. This project will trace how these impacts are understood and experienced and what these impacts reveal about local political processes and their relation to higher level politics more generally. The research will be conducted in Brazil, where government regulation of oil extraction is coupled with mandatory community-level, oil company-funded Environmental Education (EE) projects.\r\n\r\nDias will carry out 12 months of ethnographic research in Quilombo da Rasa, a community of Afro-descendants (\"maroons\") located in northeast Brazil.  She will collect data on the relationship between EE and community politics at two levels: (1) the broader level of political practices and relations with state agencies; and (2) the more micro level of community social dynamics. She will employ a mix of social science research methods including participant observation, interviews, and archival research.  \r\n\r\nFindings from this research will contribute to social science theory of how political processes work throughout the chain of relationships, from national institutions to community-level power dynamics. The research also will help policy makers to understand the  broader logics of governance that bridge strategic interests of resource extraction with progressive environmental legislation and state regulation of corporations. Funding this research supports the education of a graduate student.",

Similar to \"maroon\" communities elsewhere in Latin America, \"quilombos\" are Afro-descendant communities that have appropriated a legal category of identity (related to territorial and cultural resistance against slavery and racial discrimination) to fight for rights to land and social policies. EE projects are part of the process of environmental licensing of oil extraction in Brazil; they are monitored by Brazil\u00c6s federal environmental agency, IBAMA, and conducted by consultancy firms hired by oil companies seeking environmental licensing.\n \n  The aim of this project was to understand how state regulation of the oil industry through EE is affecting the political landscapes of the quilombo communities of Rasa and Maria Joaquina at two levels: at the broader level of political practices &ndash; i.e., how new relations among state agencies, community leadership and the oil company are reshaping how local political claims are made &ndash; and at the more micro level of community social dynamics.

My subsequent analysis will examine narratives of non-politically engaged adults to investigate how community politics becomes disavowed as a form of engagement in the local social landscape.\n\n \n\nProject outcomes include: three conference presentations, one chapter in an edited volume (under review) and, in the future, a thesis/diss..."
