 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses three main topics:\r\n(1) The well-posedness theory of the initial value problem for the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) hierarchy,\r\nbased on the approach initiated by the PI jointly with N. Pavlovic (UT Austin).\r\nA main motivation underlying our work is our aim at generalizing methods from nonlinear dispersive \r\nPDE's for the analysis of quantum field theories (QFT's). \r\n(2) Problems in non-relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), in particular relating to the \r\nsemiclassical motion of electrons, radiation damping, and the problem of ultraviolet\r\nrenormalization in QED.\r\n(3) Derivation of kinetic equations from kinetic scaling limits of the thermal momentum \r\ndistribution function for interacting electron gases, modeled in dynamical Hartree-Fock theory. \r\nThese projects involve several ongoing collaborations, including international ones.\r\n \r\nStudy of the GP hierarchy, which emerges in the analysis of interacting Bose gases, bridges\r\nsome of the most exciting recent developments in physics (Bose-Einstein condensation)\r\nwith some of the most impressive recent developments in mathematics (nonlinear dispersive PDE's).\r\nNon-relativistic QED is the physical theory of non-relativistic quantum mechanical matter \r\n(electrons, atoms, molecules) interacting with the energy quanta (photons) of light, and\r\ndescribes processes in a wide spectrum of quintessential areas in technology (chemistry,\r\nelectronics, modeling of solar panels, etc). The derivation of kinetic equations from quantum\r\ndynamics leads to a precise mathematical understanding of classical physics (fluid dynamics) \r\nfrom quantum physics.\r\nThe educational component of this project involves the training of graduate students in highly multidisciplinary \r\nannual thematic programs that provide them with a integrative and specialized understanding of\r\nlinks between Analysis, Applied and Computational Mathematics, nonlinear PDE's, and Mathematical Physics.  \r\nThe goal is to provide graduate students with an exceptionally broad understanding of their research fields.",
