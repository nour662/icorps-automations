The host scientist is Dr. Mike Y. Chen.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to investigate the types of gesture and sketch interactions that humans make with their hands and arms in the air, and to use that gained knowledge for enhancing natural user interfaces which exploit those types of interactions.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
