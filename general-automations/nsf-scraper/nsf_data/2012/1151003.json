 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to ascertain the effects of roof shapes and coverings on uplift pressures and the dynamic response of flexible roofing systems subjected to hurricane winds. This objective will be accomplished through full-scale testing in the 12-fan Wall of Wind (WoW) simulation laboratory at Florida International University. The educational objective is to increase the number of undergraduate students in hurricane engineering academic programs. The project aims are to: (1) determine the extent to which full-scale testing can improve roof peak pressure estimates by simulating local flow fields near critical components; (2) determine through full-scale testing the dynamic response of flexible roofing systems subjected to high winds; and (3) synergistically integrate low building aerodynamics research with inductive learning to foster improvement in undergraduate student knowledge in hurricane engineering. The expected contributions include: (1) new load modification functions to improve peak estimates in existing aerodynamic database; (2) new knowledge on progressive load distribution among roof subassemblies before damage initiation and as damage propagates; and (3) new strategic framework for educating and influencing the career path of undergraduate and graduate students. \r\n\r\nThe research is expected to benefit the society as it has the potential of significantly improving building codes and standards to enhance the resiliency of low buildings that are vulnerable to damage in hurricane winds. These changes in building codes and standards will improve construction practices of low buildings and reduce damages in hurricane storms. Advancement of discovery will be incorporated in to education through step-by-step integration of new knowledge with inductive learning. Broadening participation of underrepresented groups will be fostered through active recruitment from minority serving institutions for this fascinating subject area. The educational contribution of this project will be significant by increasing number of students pursuing a career path of hurricane-qualified engineers. Research and education infrastructure will be enhanced through demonstration of valuable use of the 12-fan WoW facility and inductive learning modules transportable to wind/hurricane engineering curriculum around the globe. Outreach activities will be broadly pursued through presentations at various forums and publications.",
