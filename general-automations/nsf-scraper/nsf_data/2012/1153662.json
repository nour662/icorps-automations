These will include a four-and-a- half-hour symposium for educators, six individual sessions that are designed to follow the symposia, a staffed OPP booth in the exhibit area for the duration of the conference, two workshops for teachers held in conjunction with the exhibit hall, and three web seminars that serve to extend learning opportunities after the national conference.\r\n",
