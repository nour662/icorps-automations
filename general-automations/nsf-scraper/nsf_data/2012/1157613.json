 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this catalytic planning visit, Prof. Eylem Ekici of Ohio State University (OSU) will initiate cooperative research with partners in Spain to examine nano-scale communication systems.  Spanish counterparts, led by Prof. Albert Cabellos with the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, have expertise in molecular communication in nanoscale networks and are based at the Nanonetworking Center (N3Cat) in Catalonia.  Their strengths complement those of the OSU research team in carbon nanotube antennas.  Together, the goal is to refine and develop plans for a cooperative research project to build hybrid nano-communication networks that combine desirable characteristics observed in electromagnetic wave information transmission (RF-based) and in molecular diffusion information transmission.  If successful, their efforts may lead to innovative design approaches to nano-scale communication components and networks that are capable of acting together to handle complex tasks.\r\n\r\nContributions to development of new communication paradigms with integrated nano/molecular subsystems are among the broader impacts anticipated from the planned long-term collaboration.  Results may lead to improved nanosystems with future applications in environmental and biomedical situations where nanodevices provide an interface between biological phenomena and electronic devices.  Furthermore, because graduate students will be part of this US-Spanish collaboration, they are expected to benefit from interdisciplinary course work inspired by the team's latest findings and from their early career introduction to international research in the emerging field of communications engineering.",
