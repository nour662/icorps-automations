 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop on the Neurobiology of Stress, to be held in Philadelphia, PA June 12-15th, brings together researchers (principal investigators and trainees) who study stress-brain interactions and the basic neurobiology of these interactions. In recent years there have been significant advances in the neurobiology of stress research. Those advances include new understanding of the neurosystems, neurochemistry, and cellular biology that supports stress responses and stress adaptation. Session topics and speakers for this Workshop have been selected to cover many of those exciting new advances. The Workshop will provide an important forum where new advances can be critically evaluated and integrated into the collective knowledge and perspectives of active basic stress researchers. Moreover, it is expected that the intensive scientific exchange will generate new ideas and collaborations that support future advances. There are significant broader impacts that will emerge from this meeting. The results will be widely disseminated in two premier journals. Assessment tools will be developed to determine the extent to which scientific exchange occurred, to assess the value of the scientific knowledge and content acquired, and any resultant collaborations or exchanges. These multifactorial tools can be broadly disseminated to organizers of other conferences. Finally, multiple opportunities exist for trainees to become engaged in the scientific program, including a specific plan to recruit female and minority students to attend the meeting. A significant portion of the requested funds will be used to fund meritorious trainees. This will help expand diversity and encourage trainees to stay in science careers and this is important for generating new ideas and new approaches towards solving problems that have plagued American society for decades.",
