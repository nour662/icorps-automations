 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to measure speciated volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds during the Fourth Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment (FLAME-IV), to be held in Missoula, Montana from October 15 to November 16, 2012. Aspects of the investigation include: (1) the fast changes in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and other species within the first few hours after emission; (2) emissions of as-yet unidentified higher molecular weight VOCs, which contribute to the formation of secondary products such as ozone, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and organic acids; and (3) the interaction between emitted trace gases and particles with clouds. The University of California, Irvine group will collect whole air samples in the biomass burning emissions of globally important fuels using stainless steel canisters followed by analysis using multi-column gas chromatography. The University of Miami group will measure a selection of the whole air samples, extending the measurements into the semi-volatile range, using a high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer and solid adsorbent traps. Together these measurements will yield important new information about the chemical and physical properties of smoke, its evolution, and its interactions with clouds.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is a multi-investigator project focusing on the combustion of globally important fuels in a controlled environment, it will be possible to examine processes that will eventually allow better parameterization of biomass emission impacts in predictive chemistry/climate models. The project will also help to develop next-generation instrumentation via trace gas analysis using a new instrumental capability at the University of Miami, a high resolution time of flight mass spectrometer. It is expected that the high resolution spectra obtained from the different samples will provide a unique characterization of the complex composition of smoke and its variations during aging. The results from this project will help in the development of a graduate course in Advanced Environmental Mass Spectrometry at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS). The results from this study will be published in the peer-reviewed literature and will be presented at international, interdisciplinary conferences. The project will include members from underrepresented groups as participants in this study, in both the sampling and analytical measurements.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBiomass burning emissions play a major role in atmospheric chemistry and physics.  Biomass burning is the main source of primary fine carbon-containing particles to the atmosphere, the second largest source of total trace gases, and a major source of cloud condensation nuclei and key secondary products such as ozone (O3)&mdash;a greenhouse gas and key component of photochemical smog (Crutzen and Andreae, 2000; Bond et al., 2004; Sudo and Akimoto, 2007; Petters et al., 2009; Akagi et al., 2011).  \n\nDespite its large role in atmospheric chemistry, there are still critical gaps in our understanding of the impact of smoke on the atmosphere (for example, diverse but little-studied fast changes that occur in the chemical and optical properties of smoke in the first few hours after emission).  To address these gaps, the multi-investigator Fourth Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment (FLAME-IV) took place in Missoula, Montana from October 15&ndash;November 16, 2012.  The broad objective of the FLAME-IV experiment was to better understand the impact of smoke on the atmosphere.  As part of this study, the University of California, Irvine (UCI) team sought to investigate the chemical properties of smoke and the evolution of VOC species in the first few hours after emission, characterize VOC emissions from the most important global fuel types, and make these high-precision speciated VOC data available to the other research teams.\n\nTo achieve these objectives and in collaboration with other FLAME-IV research teams, the UCI group collected 92 whole air samples from a variety of globally important fuels.  Each air sample was analyzed using multi-column gas chromatography for methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and 60 speciated C1-C10 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, aromatics, pinenes, organic nitrates, halocarbons and sulfur compounds.  Gas chromatography is a well-established method for accurately identifying and precisely quantifying a wide range of VOCs (Simpson et al., 2011). \n\nA variety of fuels were ignited and sampled under controlled laboratory conditions, including black spruce, ponderosa pine, okote, sawgrass, peat, African grasses, alfalfa, chamise, hay, wheat, manzanita, millet, rice straw, sawgrass and wiregrass, as well as tires and trash.  For example, Indonesian peat is one of the least studied fuel types.  Whereas absolute VOC concentrations were much larger in the Indonesian peat smoke compared to Canadian peat, as a ratio to CO they were in general about &frac12; to ? those of Canadian peat.   \n\nA range of ambient conditions were tested including daytime photochemistry (lights), nighttime photochemistry (dark + O3), and low VOC/NOx environments (where NOx are nitrogen oxides, which react with VOCs in the presence of sunlight to create O3).  The time series of VOCs measured by UCI was used to quantify decreases in the concentrations of reactive species such as isoprene and alkenes within the first hour of emissions under daytime photochemistry, as well as the creation of secondary products such as organic nitrates. \n\n            The FLAME-IV results from the UCI WAS group have been submitted to the FLAME archive.  The UCI team remotely participated in the FLAME-IV data workshop (October 8?9, 2013), during which the WAS data were presented and plans were made to use these data in papers, both independently and as part of synthesis work with other research teams.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements:  The UCI sampling would not have been possible without the assistance of numerous FLAME-IV colleagues.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES:\n\n \n\nAkagi, S.
