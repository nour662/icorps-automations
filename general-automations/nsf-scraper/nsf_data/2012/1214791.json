 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes a cost-effective method for reducing the quantities of copper used for agricultural crop protection. Currently, millions of pounds of copper are being sprayed onto plants each year. This copper is released into the environment, resulting in contamination of soil and waterways and deleterious effects on the ecosystem. Furthermore, pathogens are becoming resistant to copper pesticides, necessitating even higher rates of copper usage. The scope of the proposed project is to optimize the structure of Agile Sciences? library of small, non-toxic organic compounds, to provide an economically viable solution for reducing the amount of copper released into the environment.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes both environmental and economic considerations. Bacterial pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to copper, but farmers currently have few economically feasible alternatives. Agile?s compounds enhance the efficacy of copper treatments, so that the amount of copper released into the environment is substantially reduced.",

The global market for bactericidal products is estimated to be $400M, and upwards of 95% of bacterial strains on plants are resistant to the current standard copper treatment.  Millions of pounds of copper are sprayed on plants each year, resulting in substantial pollution. \n\nDuring this Phase I project period, a highly potent organic compound was identified that enhances the effectiveness of the current industry-standard copper treatment in controlling bacterial plant disease.  This compound was identified through a chemical optimization effort that systematically examined the structure-activity relationship of Agile Sciences' proprietary compound library.  When evaluated in vitro, the lead compound lowered the minimum inhibitoryconcentration (MIC) of copper by &gt;8-fold when used at low ppm rates.  When tested on live pepper plants infected with Xanthomonas bacteria, the Agile compound + copper treatment provided a clear benefit over the standard copper treatment in reducing the bacterial disease. \n\nIn our Phase II project, we will scale up production of the lead compound;\nperform additional studies to define product use rates, application time, and\nformulation; and conduct toxicity studies that will be required for EPA\napproval of the product. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/09/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Samuel O Reyes"
