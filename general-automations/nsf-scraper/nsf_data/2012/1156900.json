 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to Florida A&M University that will provide research training for 8 students for 10 weeks, during the summers of 2012-2015. This program focuses on the use of basic tools in genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics to address important biological questions.  A multidisciplinary team of faculty from the disciplines of biology, agricultural sciences, and chemistry will serve as mentors. REU students will conduct full time lab research, as well as participate in seminars and workshops on topics like the responsible conduct of research, professional development, career opportunities, and the graduate school application process.  The program also includes visits to the University of Florida core facility and others to broaden student's exposure to cutting-edge instrumentation and techniques. Example projects include the genetic engineering of plants to impart resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, the molecular and cellular studies to understand plant defense mechanism against attack by pathogens, using proteomics to elucidate protein functions, the study of gene expression in plant development, and others. Recruitment of students will utilize \"hard copy\" as well as digital-based advertising. Students will be selected based on their academic record, faculty recommendations, and research interest. Students will be tracked to determine their continued interest in their area of study, their career paths, and the lasting influence of the research experience. The program will be evaluated using the REU common assessment tool found at www.bioreu.org. More information can be found by visiting http://www.famu.edu/index.cfm?REU, or by contacting the PI, Dr. Virginia Gottschalk (virginia.gottschalk@famu.edu, 850-561-2750) or the co-PI, Dr. Ramesh Katam (ramesh.katam@gmail.com, 850-559-3134).",
