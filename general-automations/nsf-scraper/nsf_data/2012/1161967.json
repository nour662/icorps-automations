 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to develop scattering, imaging, and digital image analysis tools, combined with deformable tissue culture scaffolds, to investigate the mechanics of angiogenesis in 3D systems.  Angiogenesis is formation of blood vessels within developing and wounded tissue, an essential process for oxygen, nutrient, and waste exchange between blood and metabolically active cells.  Studies conducted under this award will apply dynamic light and x-ray scattering, and time-lapse imaging, to measure morphology, motion, and force generation in endothelial cell networks growing within 3D scaffolds.  Culture scaffold material properties and chemical functionality the will be investigated to determine their role in angiogenesis.  In parallel, molecular biology techniques will be employed to study the underlying molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis, including genetic screens, histological evaluation of cell networks, and immunohistochemical evaluations of angiogenic marker expression.  \r\n\r\nIf successful, these studies would add significantly to the field?s understanding of mechanics in angiogenesis and represent an integration of time-lapse characterization tools, scaffold engineering, and molecular biology for 3D cell mechanics studies.  The knowledge gained from these efforts will enhance the field?s ability to investigate collective cell mechanics in other 3D tissue constructs, providing a set of tools for the large multicellular systems typically found in tissue engineering, wound healing, and regenerative medicine studies, and advancing technology development within these areas.  The educational plan focuses on digital imaging and analysis tools for use in K-12 science classes, and the creation of an annual workshop with educators at a partner school in which teaching modules will be developed and distributed to participating science teachers.  The initiative will involve extensive sharing of analysis software and discussions of how to effectively incorporate contemporary imaging and analysis tools to improve the communication of scientific concepts that are difficult to grasp, or difficult to observe, without these tools.",
