 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inverse problems like parameter estimation, data assimilation, optimal\r\nengineering design, and optimal control of large scale systems governed by\r\npartial differential equations,  are of considerable importance in many\r\nfields including atmospheric science and oceanography, aerospace\r\nengineering, and fluid and structural mechanics.\r\n\r\nState-of-the-art solvers for large scale partial differential equations\r\nadaptively refine the time step and the mesh, and adjust the computational\r\npattern according to the features of the solution. Adaptivity is necessary\r\nto control the numerical errors introduced by temporal and spatial\r\ndiscretizations and to preserve the qualitative features of the solution\r\n(e.g., avoid the formation of spurious wiggles). In contrast, most inverse\r\nproblems to date have been solved using non-adaptive methods (e.g., fixed\r\ngrids and timesteps).\r\n\r\nThis project develops a fully discrete framework for solving inverse\r\nproblems in the context of adaptive models. The framework fills the gap\r\nbetween the state-of-the-art adaptive methods used in (forward)\r\nsimulations and the computational tools currently available for the\r\nsolution of inverse problems. The specific research objectives are to\r\ndevelop discrete algorithms for inverse problems with models that employ\r\nrefinement of the spatial discretization, and adaptive time stepping, to\r\nguarantee that the discrete inversion process leads to convergent\r\nnumerical approximations, and to control the accuracy of the inverse\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nThe results of this work are general algorithms and methodologies that\r\nwill advance the field of inverse problems by developing the capability to\r\nadapt time steps, grid sizes, and computational patterns, such as to\r\ncontrol the quality and accuracy of the inverse solutions.  These results\r\nhave the potential to impact any mature\r\nfield which relies on adaptive simulations, such as data assimilation in\r\natmospheric sciences, oceanography, and environmental sciences; optimal\r\ncontrol of flows, and optimal engineering design.\r\n\r\nThe algorithmic and software tools developed during this research will be\r\nlargely disseminated through specialized journals and conferences. This\r\nproject provides an excellent opportunity for training graduate students in\r\nthe areas  of inverse problems and adaptive computations.",
