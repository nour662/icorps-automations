 "awd_abstract_narration": "Combined influences of water vapor, ozone, aerosols and cirrus clouds in the upper-troposphere/lower-stratosphere (UTLS) region serve to strongly modulate radiative forcing of the earth's climate system.  The composition of this region is affected not only by chemical processes, but also by dynamical ones such as cross-tropopause exchange and convective transports originating near the earth's surface.  The Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign, to be conducted May-June 2012, will support study of the contrasting impacts of continental midlatitude thunderstorm systems on UTLS composition and chemistry within three regions (viz. northeastern Colorado, western Oklahoma and Texas, and northern Alabama) characterized by differing background chemistry and characteristic storm behavior.  This award will support adaptation of an existing tunable diode laser-based instrument, the University of Colorado closed-path laser hygrometer, to make measurements of total water (from which condensed liquid and ice water contents may be derived) aboard the NSF/NCAR GV research aircraft during DC3.  A new inlet specific to the selected sampling location aboard the GV will be designed and built in collaboration with a consultant from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University to enable accurate sampling of a wide range of cloud particle sizes (10-400 micrometers).\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research rests on provision of precise and accurate measurements of total water at high spatial resolution within the upper reaches of midlatitude convective cloud systems, which will in-turn allow investigators to describe differing transport properties of shear-driven vs. airmass-type thunderstorms, their attendant evolving microphysical properties over cloud lifecycles, and how anvil radiative environments differ from region to region and with time during the interval 12-48 hours after cessation of active convection.  Broader impacts will include graduate student training and public outreach, but will ultimately extend to improved understanding of controls on atmospheric ozone and associated links to climate assessment and policy formulation.",

By rapidly warming the air sampled by a foward-facing inlet, the instrument evaporates water and subsequently measures the total amount of water vapor, allowing for the determination of the amount of condensed water in clouds. This quantity is important for understanding cloud formation, precipitation, and interactions of clouds with visible and infrared radiation. In conjunction with other observations, the results of these studies allow for the identification and characterization of different types of particles in clouds. For example, in one publication it was shown that at the tops of thunderstorms there is a type of particle called a \"frozen droplet aggregate\", essentially a twisted, long chain of droplets that stick together upon freezing, a process that is faciltated by electric charges created by lightning in thunderstorms. In addition to the observations in and around thunderstorms in the continental United States, observations were obtained in the Southern Hemisphere near Antarctica in \"mixed-phased clouds,\" or clouds containing both liquid and frozen water in the same space. These clouds are particularly difficult to model; therefore, observations directly within them help to constrain models that are used to predict the impacts of such clouds on precipitation and energy exchange near the earth's surface. Finally, we were able to obtain the first observations of cloudwater contents from a research aircraft flying over a highly polluted region in the western Pacific Ocean. These observations will allow future studies into the role of natural and human-caused sources of particulates on cloud properties. Specifically, there is an interest in quantifying a phenomenon called the \"aerosol indirect effect,\" or how particle enhancements supress the sizes of cloud droplets which in turn reduces precipitation back to the surface. Studies such as these are useful for determining the impact of air pollution on rainfall patterns, something that is important for agriculture as well as human health.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/31/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Darin&nbsp;W&nbsp;Toohey</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1104642/1104642_10144994_1490990261291_DSC_6091--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1104642/1104642_10144994_1490990261291_DSC_6091--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cloudwater Instrument on NSF G-V Aircraft\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1104642/1104642_10144994_1490990261291_DSC_6091--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cloudwater Instrument on NSF G-V Aircraft\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This photograph was taken on a recent mission where clouds were sampled by the University of Colorado Closed Path Hygrometer (CLH-2).
