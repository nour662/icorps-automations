 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor John D. Protasiewicz of the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University will explore the development of new types of conjugated molecules and polymers.  While such types of technologically important materials have been known for some time, most of these materials are solely based upon arrays of carbon-carbon double or triple bonds.  This project seeks to expand the range of conjugated materials to include other types of double bonds, especially those that include the double bonded group 15 elements phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.  New types of synthetic methods achieve these materials will be also developed.  Photochemical studies of these new materials will be undertaken to explore new properties.\r\n\r\nThis work could lead to new classes of hybrid organic-inorganic conjugated materials having significant photophysical properties.  These materials will also contribute to the basic understanding of conjugated materials chemistry.  Advances in this project could have impacts on fields and applications such as sensor technology, organic light emitting diodes, solar photovoltaics, molecular electronics, and other areas where energy (in the form of light or electricity) meets molecules and polymers.  In addition, this project will provide excellent interdisciplinary training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.",

These \"main group\" analogues of the organic conjugated materials are only recently been receiving attention by scientists.  Because the fundamental nature of the double bonds (pi-bonds) between elements changes substantially when one moves away from carbon, one can expect very different properties for the molecules and polymers.  For example, changing the double bonds can lead to smaller band gaps in electronic materials and could lead to materials able to give off different colors of light.  Figure 1 shows one subset of molecules (1,3-benzoxaphospholes) we have designed and synthesized in our labs that are highly fluorescent (give off light at a lower wavelength when exposed to light of higher energy).  Note how color changes as the structures change.\n\nOur research outcomes include (a) advances in the synthesis of new types of double bonds between carbon and phosphorus atoms (b) new strategies for the design of conjugated molecules and polymers (c) detailed photochemical studies of new materials and better understanding of relationships between structure and properties involving main group compounds.  Many of our specific outcomes have been published (disseminated) in peer-reviewed journals and at numerous presentations at universities and conferences around the world, including invited lecturers in the US, Mexico, Japan, Sweden and New Zealand during the this grant.  Our outcomes are important and have impacts for other scientists who work in this area of chemistry.  While our materials are currently \"far from market\", our discoveries are helping to unravel the fundamental design principles surrounding basic science of conjugated materials chemistry.
