 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) and the Chemical Measurements and Imaging (CMI) Programs, Professor Robert Continetti from the University of California San Diego will build a novel aerosol impact spectrometer (AIS). The AIS will provide a new experimental approach for the study of the chemistry of charged aerosol particles in the 50 nm to 1 micron size range, providing analysis of the chemical composition and morphology using both laser desorption ionization (LDI) and hypervelocity impact on an inert surface. The analytical process involves a series of carefully choreographed steps. The instrument will first trap particles/aerosols in a quadrupole ion trap, where they can be chemically modified if desired, and sequentially eject them into an image-charge mass spectrometer to determine the mass and charge state. The particles will then be accelerated to a high velocity prior to impact on a single-crystal diamond surface. Chemical analysis of charged products will be performed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) and neutral species desorbed on impact will be analyzed by vacuum ultraviolet laser photoionization TOF-MS. Variation of the velocity of impact will provide a new variable for studying the chemical properties of mass-resolved single particles as a function of depth, yielding a technique for aerosol studies analogous to the widely used secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) technique that uses the impact of known ionic particles to characterize surfaces.\r\n \r\nThe chemistry of aerosols and nanoparticles has broad importance to understanding environmental and biological systems, and further development of techniques to understand the chemistry of particles as a function of size, such as mass spectrometry, is essential. Mass spectrometry vaporizes and ionizes a sample by a variety of methods. The particles (parent and fragment ions) flow into a mass spectrometer where their mass/charge ratios are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows determination of the masses of the particles, their chemical composition and enables one to deduce the structure of the substances in a complex mixture. The instrument that will be developed will apply a new analytical tool in mass spectrometry (hypervelocity impact) that will have broad application for the characterization of complex nanoparticles and aerosols at a single-particle mass-resolved level of detail. This will yield unique information on the chemistry of aerosols and particles and will be useful in fields as diverse as Chemistry, Biology and Environmental studies. The initial focus of the studies will be on atmospheric aerosols and biologically modified synthetic nanoparticles. This research project will also help train a new generation of instrumentalists in state-of-the-art techniques.",

Particle-surface interactions play an essential role in many phenomena, ranging from atmospheric chemistry and weather, to the interactions of spacecraft with interstellar dust, to industrial applications in the semiconductor industry and others. The instrument we have built, known as the &lsquo;Aerosol Impact Spectrometer&rsquo;, is a device that allows for the acceleration or deceleration of charged nanoparticles from initial velocities in the 50 &ndash; 80 m/s range to final velocities in the 10 &ndash; 1000 m/s range</strong><strong>, and the investigation of particle-surface interactions</strong><strong>. </strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The most unique feature of this apparatus is that it determines the mass (m) and charge (z) of individual nanoparticles prior to accelerating/decelerating to the desired final velocity, all in real time. This was achieved by combining an electrospray ionization source with an aerodynamic lens coupled with a linear electrostatic trap optimized for nanoparticles (the NET). While the particle is trapped in the NET, a high speed data acquisition analysis code determines the m/z ratio, the mass m and the charge z of the particle. The m/z ratio provides the information required to accelerate the particle in a nine-stage linear accelerator, and the data acquisition program generates the appropriate sequence of high-voltage electronic pulses to achieve the desired final velocity. This real-time analysis capability means that this apparatus can handle particles with a very wide range of masses and charges in a single experiment, providing a unique tool for the manipulation of single nanoparticles.</strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The capabilities of the apparatus have been demonstrated by measuring the mass and charge of reference polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres in the 0.5 &ndash; 1.0 micron size range. PSL spheres can be charged using the technique of electrospray ionization, and the particles then injected into the NET using an aerodynamic lens and a quadrupole deflector for energy selection. Using these PSL spheres as a reference allowed calibration of the mass spectrometer, and also enabled the measurement of other quantities pertinent to the understanding of the velocity dependence of particle impact phenomena. In particular it is very straightforward</strong><strong> with this apparatus</strong><strong> to measure the fraction of particles reflected as a function of incident velocity, as well as the inelasticity of the collision, a parameter known as the coefficient of restitution that is determined by the ratio of the reflected </strong><strong>and incident velocities</strong><strong> of the particle.

At the present time we are working closely with an industrial partner, Cymer/ASML, to examine how tin nanoparticles scatter off of surfaces and are transported in a reaction vessel. Cymer/ASML is engaged in the development of 13.5 nm extreme ultraviolet radiation that will provide the basis for the production of even higher density integrated circuits in the coming years, enabling the continued development of higher speed computers, cell phones and enabling the advent of a world characterized by the &lsquo;internet of things&rsquo;, where our homes, workplaces, modes of transport, etc., are all increasingly interconnected.
