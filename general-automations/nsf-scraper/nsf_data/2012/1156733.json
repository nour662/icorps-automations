 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF REU project will provide research opportunities for 8 talented undergraduate students to spend 8 weeks working with four faculty mentors at Georgia State University, an outside faculty mentor from Georgia Tech, two industrial mentors from McAfee and Barracuda Networks, and graduate students. The teams will conduct hands-on research projects in high performance data-mining for bioinformatics and network security. The students will work on research projects to master professional research skills and submit research papers for real publications. Summer activities will include participation in student data mining competitions such as the Data Mining Cup and the UC San Diego Data Mining Contest. \r\n\r\nThis project recruit students from small colleges with limited research resources. The project will include a web-based student data mining club (a global student data mining e-community) that can be used by not only the REU students but also other students interested in high performance data mining research and its applications. Opportunities to explore broad future career opportunities will be provided by the student's research and access to graduate students, scientists, engineers, and faculty members. \r\n",

REU students visited the Communications Assurance and Performance Group at Georgia Tech to learn latest network security techniques.
