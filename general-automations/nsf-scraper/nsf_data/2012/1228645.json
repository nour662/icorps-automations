 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coercion attacks that compel an authorized user to reveal his or her secret authentication credentials can give attackers access to restricted systems.  The PIs are developing a new approach to preventing coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning from cognitive psychology.  Implicit learning refers to learning of patterns without any conscious knowledge of the learned pattern. Using a carefully crafted keyboard-based computer game the PIs plant a secret password in the participant's brain without the participant having any conscious knowledge of the trained password.  This planted secret can be used for authentication, but participants cannot be coerced into revealing their secret since they have no conscious knowledge of it.   \r\n\r\nThis project explores three directions for using implicit learning in computer security.  First, the PIs are developing implicit learning tasks designed to be used in challenge-response authentication. Second, the PIs are experimenting with methods to demonstrate implicit knowledge by measuring electrical activity along the scalp using off the shelf EEG devices.  Third, the PIs are conducting user experiments to demonstrate that participants are able to properly authenticate, but cannot consciously recognize the trained secret.  This project is a collaboration between computer security researchers and cognitive psychologists.  Ultimately, the project aims to understand how the brain represents implicit knowledge.  This in turn will lead to new coercion resistant security mechanisms for high-security applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project is a collaboration between computer security researchers, Dan Boneh and Pat Lincoln, and a cognitive psychologist, Paul Reber. The project explored several areas where the two disciplines intersect.\n\nThe project emerged from our joint work on rubber hose resistant authentication.  The core idea is based on the concept of implicit learning: information stored in the human brain that is not consciously accessible to us.  This is often called \"muscle memory\" and is stored in an area of the brain associated with the basal ganglia.  An example is the ability to ride a bicycle are play golf. We do it subconsciously and cannot explain how.\n\nOur project began by studying a strong form of user authentication based on implicit learning.  The core idea is to train a person to become proficient at a specific task, such as recognizing a sequence of letters in a game similar to guitar hero.  The game is designed so that this knowledge is stored in the basal ganglia, and is not consciously accessible to the player.  We can later authenticate that person by repeatedly testing his or her performance on the trained sequence versus a random sequence.  The interesting aspect of this system is that the person can prove knowledge of the credential, but does not consciously know it.  As a result, even under duress, he or she cannot reveal the secret credential.\n\nWe validated that the system works as expected and explored various attacks, such as partial recognition of the secret pattern.  We showed that these attacks either take too long or are unreliable. Next, we explored ways in which our authentication scheme can be integrated into a popular game, such as Flappy Bird.  Authentication is done by simply playing one round of the game.  We chose Flappy Bird because it lets us subconsciously teach the player a secret pattern that is later used for authentication.  Many other games are good candidates for this form of authentication, including any infinite runner game.  \n\nWe next shifted to other forms of authentication.  We developed a strong technique for fingerprinting a phone using its hardware accelerometer.  We also studied the security of browser-based password managers.  Specifically, we showed a number of weaknesses in existing password managers.  We were happy to be acknowledged when some large browser vendors deployed our proposed defenses.  \n\nFinally, we developed a number of unexpected applications for cell phone sensors.  Most surprisingly, we showed that the power meter sensor on a phone can be used to reveal the phone's location.  This is especially worrisome because any application can read the power meter without asking the user.  In contrast, the GPS system requires clear user consent.  We also showed that the phone's gyroscope is sufficiently sensitive to be used as a crude microphone. Again, accessing the gyroscope does not require user permission. \n\nBeyond research, we actively participated in many outreach activities, such as teaching in math circles events, giving talks at high schools, and participating in events for Girls who Code.  We used cryptography, and the creative connection to Psychology, as a way to excite students about mathematics and computer science.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dan Boneh"
