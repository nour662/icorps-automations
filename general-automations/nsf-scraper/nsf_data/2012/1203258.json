 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a pilot effort to engage in discussions to change arctic ocean model inter comparison activities (Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project, AOMIP) into a new project called the Forum for Arctic Modeling and Observational Synthesis (FAMOS) that will focus on the organization of arctic ocean science and enhancing collaboration and coordination among different contributing disciplines. Observationalists, theoreticians, and modelers will be represented at all levels of activities starting from generating hypotheses, to planning and finalizing analyses. This pilot effort will explore how the work will be managed through annual project meetings, virtual workshops, and scientist-to-scientists communications and collaborations. The long term FAMOS science goals are to: (i) Continue validation and improvement of regional Arctic Ocean models in a coordinated fashion, (ii) Investigate ways to improve reanalysis products with a focus on data assimilation and the design of comprehensive observing systems, (iii) Continue investigation of variability of the Arctic Ocean and sea ice at seasonal to decadal time scales focusing on the processes, and identify mechanisms responsible for the observed changes, and (vi) Analyze IPCC model results validating them against observations in the Arctic and results from the regional Arctic models. The project will sponsor a workshop; encourage and coordinate formation of intercomparison projects focused on solving current issues of interest to the observational and modeling communities; prepare papers and give talks about FAMOS and lead the ongoing intercomparison projects from initial brainstorming to final publication; provide limited funding for travel and for publication of results. \r\n\r\nIn the future it is thought that FAMOS will help improve our understanding of oceanic and sea-ice processes. The most significant FAMOS contributions will likely be: development of regional arctic models, identification of model errors and causes of these errors and model discrepancies, recommendations for improvements of existing regional coupled ice-ocean models and GCMs by implementing new physics and parameterizations for arctic processes. Within these activities, an important contribution will be an assessment of the state and variability of Arctic sea ice and ocean parameters from 1870-present. The coordinated community approach to the investigation of Arctic Ocean variability is the only way to assess the degree of uncertainty in results and conclusions made by different modelers, scientific groups, or institutions. Therefore, FAMOS will contribute to this assessment and establish a set of benchmarks characterizing the state-of-the-art of Arctic Ocean modeling, and the newest analysis of the Arctic Ocean climate and its variability. One of the highest impacts of the FAMOS activity is educational (including the AOMIP/FAMOS school) because it promotes the growth of young scientists participating in the project, provides guidelines for critical analysis of the existing models, and fruitful improvements and developments of the arctic models by a new generation of arctic modelers.",

These were the first two FAMOS meetings, transitioning from our previous project called AOMIP = Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project.  What happens at our annual meeting?  The first day is a school for new arctic marine scientists, where 5-6 senior lecturers give lectures on hot topics of the day, with extensive time budgeted for discussion.  In the afternoon, 1.5 hours are devoted to a discussion of community outreach in relation to arctic marine science.  Our students (~30-40 each year) come from the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia.  This grant supports the travel of ~ 50-70%, with the rest using their own funding to attend the meeting.  We always receive very positive feedback from the students concerning the format and content of the school day.\n\n     The second through fourth days are the \"regular\" workshop, where ~120 attendees present their recent research in lectures and posters.  Break-out sessions are a key, unique aspect of FAMOS, as they are devoted exclusively to brainstorming collaborative projects that will then continue through the coming year.  A number of such projects have already led to peer-reviewed scientific publications, and more are on their way. \n\n     FAMOS is focused on arctic marine modelers, and those who desire to work with such people.  That means we focus on those who are running computer simulations of arctic climate and smaller-scale processes, looking at the ocean (sea level, ocean currents, biogeochemistry, ecosystems) and the overlying sea ice pack.  But in fact we have tremendous buy-in from meteorologists, glaciologists, hydrologists, and observationalists who are not actually running these models but who have the data that modelers can use to make sure their results are accurate.\n\n     FAMOS is a \"medium-scale\" meeting, which hits a sweet spot in the community, i.e., not small like an invitation-only workshop (which often excludes younger people) and not huge like international society meetings of many thousands.  This size seems to be key for fostering the lively discussions and resulting collaborations that are a recurring feature of FAMOS.\n\n     This particular grant funded a new phase in the evolution of our project, transitioning from a more model-only focus (AOMIP) to a model-observations interaction framework (FAMOS).  We have seen an increase in this interaction, to the benefit of both modelers and observationalists.  Papers are published or are in preparation that clearly show where models need improvement, and also where observations are lacking that models indicate would be especially beneficial to understanding the arctic climate system. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/03/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Steele"
