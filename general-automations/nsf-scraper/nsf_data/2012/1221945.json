The research focuses on documents and documenting practices as important windows into the socio-technical arrangements of scientific teams. A large number of virtual scientific collaborations will be studied and compared using a mix of text mining, social network analysis and qualitative methods. The research will result in: (1) a detailed compendium regarding what document infrastructures scientists build to support their virtual organizing and documenting practices and (2) specific design principles for the distributed, social and technical aspects of scientific work. The findings will have implications for better design and management of virtual scientific teams and for CI to support scientific endeavors.",
