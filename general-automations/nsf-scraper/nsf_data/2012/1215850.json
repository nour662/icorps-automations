The workshop is expected to produce a report, giving concrete examples of what is needed to progress, from a technical standpoint and from a funding perspective. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: If successful, the workshop would help identify the research challenges and opportunities in creating the infrastructure and research networks needed to advance the understanding of aging and to develop  technologies that better support the health and wellbeing of the aging population in the US. \r\n\r\n",

Follow-up after the meeting included webinars and teleconferences to further flesh out the deliverables pertaining to the desired outcomes of the workshop.\n\nThese issues, and the outcomes from the workshop, are:\n\nDevelop an administrative and governance structure to guide the development, implementation, and sustaining functions of SNI. \n\nFigure 1 provides an illustration of the proposed administrative and governance infrastructure\nWe determined that in its operational state, the SNI will be driven principally by the activities of three \"Engines\" and six \"Cores.\" The \"Engines\" are the organizational bodies each driving a specific scientific thrust which maps to one of SNI\u00c6s three primary objectives: Discovery, Innovation, and Evidence. The \"Cores\" are organizational bodies with operational functions that cut across the Engines: Administration and Coordination Core; Clinical &amp; Biomarkers Core; Data Core; Technology Core, Ethics Core; Communications Core.\nIdentify a core of primary research aims that are of the highest clinical impact, and most effectively promote knowledge discovery and scalability so as to maximize leverage of the cohort and associated research infrastructure as a testbed for new monitoring and assessment technologies. \n\nAt the workshop, it was decided that the best plan of action was to first deisgn a proof of concept (POC) study, that would allow testing of some of the principles for data sharing, cohort recruitment, and platform scalability that were identified through discussions during the workshop.
