 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU site program builds on the strength of the existing infrastructure of the Engineering Research Center (ERC) for EUV Science and Technology to offer world-class opportunities for students to gain research experience that will prepare them for entry into graduate studies and the workforce in this critical field. The Center is a partnership between Colorado State University (CSU), University of Colorado, Boulder (CU Boulder), University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), and 18 corporate partners. In support of REU interns, this project combines the complementary expertise already established between CSU and CU Boulder - leaders in compact EUV light sources and applications - with the strong track record in EUV optics and applications present at UC Berkeley/Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The common and complementary expertise of the Center faculty, research staff, and students is built around the unified goal of research and discovery in EUV science and technology. \r\n\r\nThis unique focus on EUV sciences and technology united in common activities draws world leaders in this field together to conduct research and share their knowledge and skills with undergraduate and graduate students. Few places in the world offer this unique undergraduate study opportunity unified by the focus of advancing laser and optic science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis experience will give students perspective on how research and engineering design problems can be solved and how un-forecasted difficulties can be overcome. The research projects are highly interdisciplinary, technically and scientifically challenging, and contribute to the leading edge advancement of EUV science and technology. \r\n\r\nThis EUV ERC REU program will:1)Present students with challenging technical and scientific problems that will help them develop an approach for solving open-ended problems requiring critical thinking and creativity;2)Improve participants understanding of EUV science and technology by involving them in cutting-edge research projects with state-of-the-art equipment in collaboration with recognized EUV researchers;3)Generate interest among participants in pursuing post-graduate careers in Photonics Engineering and provide the information and the skills needed to make successful graduate school or industry applications;4)Provide opportunities for and motivate women and underrepresented minorities to enter careers in engineering and science.\r\n\r\n\"The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\"",
