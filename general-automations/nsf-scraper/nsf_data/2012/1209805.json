 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Hau Chan of Stony Brook University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Constructing social choice-based economic incentive for identifying near-optimal social outcome,\" during the summer of 2012 at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.  The host scientist is Ning Chen.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to facilitate the interaction between game theory and computer science. This fusion allows researchers to solve game-theoretical problems involving social choice using advanced computer science techniques and algorithms more efficiently.   The research seeks to develop an economic system, with budget constraints, that produces a near-optimal social outcome given the input of each individual in society. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

We discover that, under some circumstances/restrictions, the computational problems can be solved efficiently even when they are computationally intractable in general case. Namely, when the preferences profile, the set of votes received from the voters, is single-peaked, the computational problems become tractable and can be solved quickly (in polynomial time). Under single-peaked preferences profile, there exists a societal axis or linear preference order of the choices such that each voter has an ideal point on that axis and that the voter prefers the choices closer to the ideal point than the ones that are further away from it. That is, we require each vote from the voter to be linear order over all the candidates (the one who is most prefer, then the second most prefer, etc &hellip;). Following similar line of work, we investigate the difficulties of solving those computational problems when the preferences profile is single-peaked on a tree (which is a generalize version of single-peaked; one can view single-peaked as single-peaked on a path, a special type of tree on a line).&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/01/2012<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hau&nbsp;Chan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
