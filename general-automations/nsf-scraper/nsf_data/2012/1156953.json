 "awd_abstract_narration": "The San Francisco volcanic field in northern Arizona is a natural laboratory for investigating the eruptive processes of cinder-cone volcanoes, the effects of eruption and erosion of these common but small systems on landscape forms, and the patterns and timing of volcanism.  A multi-disciplinary team from Northern Arizona University, University of Arizona (Biosphere 2), and University of New Hampshire will offer an 8-week summer REU experience to 10 undergraduate students each summer, funded by the NSF Directorate for Geosciences.   Two-three students from the first-year cohort will be invited to return in the second year to mentor new students, thus ensuring a long-lasting investment in research and experience in teaching other young scientists.   The goals of the project are to provide all students with (1) a fundamental understanding of the relations between landscapes and basaltic volcanism, (2) an opportunity to construct a research project, with guidance from a mentor who will work alongside the student, (3) an understanding of how a research project is executed, from the initial research proposal to the final presentation and publication of results, (4) first-hand experience in interdisciplinary collaborations and research, and (5) a network of colleagues and mentors who will support the student's development as a scholar. \r\n\r\nIn the first two weeks of the program, students will learn theories of basaltic volcanism, Quaternary dating methods, and landscape studies.  The first week will culminate in a two-day trip to Biosphere 2, an enclosed Earth system near Tucson, AZ.  At the end of the second week, the student, with the assistance of his/her mentor, will write a research prospectus that will guide the goals and field or lab activities of the following five weeks.  After a further 1-2 week study of a specific volcano, students in Quaternary dating projects will depart for the host lab to carry out their analyses.  These students will continue to network with those who remain in Flagstaff throughout the summer, and, in the final week of the program, students and mentors will gather in Flagstaff to create posters that will model GSA/AGU posters.  On the final day, students will join with participants in other REU programs at NAU for a research symposium.  The posters will then be presented at GSA or AGU meetings that fall.",

San Francisco volcanic field, northern Arizona\" was funded in 2012 with cohorts of students in residence at Northern Arizona University in the summers 2013 and 2014.&nbsp; The purpose of the grant was to bring undergraduate students from around the country to study how landscapes react to eruption of small volcanoes, how eruptions can be dated, and how to study volcanic materials to understand the nature of eruptions.</p>\n<p>The San Francisco volcanic field (SFVF; see accompanying map) is ~4700 km<sup>2</sup> (~2000 mi<sup>2</sup>) in area and contains over 600 volcanoes that range in age from ~ 6 million to ~ 1000 years old.&nbsp; The majority of these are basaltic cinder cones; this fact, including their small size and generally comparatively simple eruptive history, means that the SFVF &nbsp;presents an ideal natural laboratory to involve undergraduates in integrated, interdisciplinary research programs that can couple volcanology and surface-process studies.</p>\n<p>Over the course of two summers, 20 students (17 female and 3 male) undertook research projects that are summarized here.&nbsp; Each summer began with a week with two primary objectives - the  mentors discussed their research and we took field trips out into the  SFVF to begin discussing projects.&nbsp; Each student&rsquo;s experience culminated in presenting the results of his or her research at a national meeting of either the Geological Society of America or the American Geophysical Union.

Because the SFVF is in a semiarid environment, distinct differences can be documented between these cones and those that erupt in more maritime environments that characterize many volcanic arcs.&nbsp; Five students (two in 2013, three in 2014) worked with Dr. Ramon Arrowsmith and his colleagues at Arizona State University using very new technologies to model simple degradation, the effects of rainwater and solar radiation on erosion, and rill development on cinder cones.</p>\n<p>* <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Soil development in a volcanic terrain</span>.&nbsp; Three students (one in 2013, two in 2014) worked with Dr. Kirk Anderson at the Museum of Northern Arizona to understand how soil morphology changes over time and how soil profiles help date volcanic activity.&nbsp; One student investigated the influences of early human activity on physical and chemical properties of volcanic soils.</p>\n<p>* <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Determining ages of volcanism</span>.&nbsp; Four students in the 2013 cohort worked on projects that sought to date young volcanoes.&nbsp; Two students worked with Dr. Tammy Rittenour at Utah State University and the other two at the University of New Hampshire with Dr. Joe Licciardi; the two groups used different methods to provide double checks on Quaternary dating methods.</p>\n<p>* <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Use of geophysics to understand subsurface volcanic features</span>.&nbsp; One student worked with Dr. Ryan Porter to understand the relative ages of emplacement of deposits at a complex cone as well as the continuation of a lava flow no longer exposed at the surface.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The program brought in 20 students from a range of educational backgrounds.&nbsp; We purposefully targeted schools at which students might have fewer research opportunities, although we discovered that motivated faculty across the country and across state or local income levels make outstanding opportunities available to their students.&nbsp; Our interns came from schools as diverse as Sitting Bull College in Fort Yates, ND, and Arizona Western College in Yuma, AZ, to Williams College in Williamstown, MA and the University of California at Berkeley.&nbsp; In 2014 we asked students with more experience to mentor those with fewer classes or less research experience; in the end, however, we found that students are outstanding at helping each other regardless of previous activities.</p>\n<p>We ended both summers&rsquo; work with a poster session open to the entire NAU community.&nbsp; Students got practice presenting their results in anticipation of the formal scientific meetings, and university faculty and administrators were able to see the accomplishments of a summer research program.</p>\n<p>Three of the 20 students matriculated to NAU, two as undergraduates and one as a MS/PhD student.&nbsp;
