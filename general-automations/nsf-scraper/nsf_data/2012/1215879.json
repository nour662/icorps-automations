 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is essential to improve understanding of interactions between surface water flows and underlying porewaters in order to advance our ability to assess connectivity in aquatic ecosystems, evaluate the propagation of carbon, nutrients, and contaminants through river networks, and predict the net effects of human modification of watersheds. Previous NSF-supported research found that hydrodynamic interactions caused rapid exchange between rivers and underlying porewater, along with ongoing deposition and resuspension of fine particles. These processes are expected to substantially influence downstream migration of solutes and particles in river networks. Unfortunately, very little information is available on the hydrodynamic mechanisms that control this behavior because it has been extremely difficult to directly measure solute and particle dynamics in porewaters. The objectives of the current project are to improve fundamental understanding of hydrodynamic interactions between freestream flows and porewaters, and to use the information gained to transform conceptual and quantitative models for solute and particle dynamics in rivers. The project will use an array of new flow visualization technologies to obtain direct observations of fluid exchange between rivers and streambeds, and the associated fluxes of solutes and fine suspended particles. The results will be used to identify the main fluid flow processes responsible for solute and particle transport across porous environmental interfaces. This work will yield improved models for the surface-subsurface flow continuum, as well as new probabilistic models for downstream solute and particle transport. The project will contribute to the broader education of students and the public by incorporating project results into major outreach efforts at Northwestern University and the University of Illinois. Focus will be on  helping K-12 students and  neighborhood communities to understand how river processes influence water quality, human health, and natural ecosystems. The PIs will also work with several university student groups to develop a new program involving regular on-campus activities and mentoring for students from populations underrepresented in the sciences. Overall, the project will engage ~1,500 K-12 students and adults citizens each year (~4,500 over the lifetime of the project) in laboratory activities and discussions of the significance of hydrological processes to sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe major scientific contributions of this work will be an improved characterization of fundamental mechanisms of flow coupling between rivers and riverbeds, and new models for the migration of dissolved and suspended materials in rivers.  Such models are essential to enable the prediction of large-scale, long-term dynamics required for sustainable management of river systems. The project will characterize important components of interfacial flux currently missing from solute transport models, and provide critical new observations of fine particle deposition and resuspension. This information is needed to address pressing problems in freshwater systems, including contaminant interactions with sediments, protection of ecological diversity within rivers, nutrient retention and carbon processing in rivers, and waterborne disease transmission. The models developed in this project can be used to evaluate the factors that produce high risks of transmission of contaminants and waterborne diseases, and thereby improve management of watersheds to minimize these risks. The project will also contribute to longer-term sustainability of drinking water resources and aquatic ecosystems by improving our capability to predict long-term biogeochemical and ecological dynamics in rivers.",

This thin layer contains one of the most fragile ecosystems on Earth, which plays host to a huge range of organisms that can only proliferate within the sediment spaces due to their slow moving water flow. From a hydraulic perspective, the top of this sediment layer represents an interface across which there may be significant movement of particles, nutrients and pollutants, with a sufficient nutrient supply and the removal of contaminants being key to preserving a healthy environment. One major issue in this zone is that fluid turbulence is known to be critical in the dynamics of fluid and particulate transport. As such, understanding how fluid moves across this water-sediment interface, and how turbulence may carry solutes and particulates with it, is a subject of widespread importance across the earth, environmental, engineering and biological sciences. This project has applied innovative laboratory experimental techniques to investigate how flow above a sediment surface is linked to flow within the pore spaces of the permeable bed below, and sought to identify the major controls on this movement.</p>\n<p>In order to tackle this research, we have developed and used laser-based imaging techniques to measure flow within the pore spaces of a simplified acrylic model of a gravel-bed river, comprising six layers of identical spheres (Figure 1). These techniques included (1) an endoscopic system used to image the pore spaces individually, and (2) a unique laboratory facility that employs a special fluid in which the entire laboratory model is rendered transparent - by matching the refractive index of the acrylic sediment grains with that of the fluid - thus allowing visualization of every pore simultaneously. These techniques were used to measure flows of different depth and velocity over a simplified flat gravel bed, as well as where a simple object was placed on the bed, in order to begin investigation of how features that may be present in real river beds, such as the egg-laying mounds produced by salmon, may influence the subsurface pore flow. Images of neutrally-buoyant tracer particles seeded within the flow and illuminated by a laser light sheet were captured on video cameras, and the movement of these particles between successive frames was used to calculate fluid velocities of the whole flow field &ndash; a technique known as Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These unique data illustrate how the depth of flow, as well as flow velocity, is influential in driving flow across the interface of the gravel-bed. Our data show that the distribution of flow velocities within the bed (Figure 1) can be successfully predicted using knowledge of the flow velocity within the &lsquo;freeflow&rsquo; of the overlying stream, but that deeper flows produce a smaller penetration of turbulence into the permeable bed. This work shows that flow velocities do not simply decrease progressively within the gravel-bed, as suggested by existing classical theory, but that the mean flow velocities show a minimum at the first layer of pores but then show an increase in the pore spaces to a certain depth (Figure 1). Flow from above the bed conveys turbulence into the pores, with a peak in the velocity fluctuations occurring, as expected, in the upper pore spaces. This data will be vital in validating and adapting present mathematical models of flow over permeable sediment beds to better represent the physics of flow that occur in such gravel-bed rivers. Our data reveal that addition of topography, such as a cylinder or sphere, to the bed surface dramatically influences the movement of water into, and out of, the bed. Experiments confirm that, as expected, such objects generate a pressure gradient at the bed that drives flow into the bed in front of the object. These unique data also reveal that fluid emerges from the bed on the downstream side of the object in the form of intense jets (Figure 2). These patterns of flow are drastically different to those normally associated with fluid movement around objects on impermeable beds, and point to the need for developing models of flow that account for these vigorous movements of water across this interface. This is key when examining the movement of sediment, nutrients or pollutants within the hyporheic zone, as it may help explain why certain organisms live under specific hydrodynamic conditions. Our research is being coupled with data detailing the movement of solutes within experiments conducted at Northwestern University under identical flow conditions. This synergy will help yield an improved understanding of the fluid dynamics across the water-sediment interface, and how this may influence the movement of solutes and particulates into this critical ecological zone of the Earth&rsquo;s surface.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/03/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;L&nbsp;Best</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1215879/1215879_10185144_1482520795143_Flowaroundacylinderonaporousbed--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1215879/1215879_10185144_1482520795143_Flowaroundacylinderonaporousbed--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mean vertical flow velocities around a cylinder atop a porous gravel bed and within the bed\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1215879/1215879_10185144_1482520795143_Flowaroundacylinderonaporousbed--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mean vertical flow velocities around a cylinder atop a porous gravel bed and within the bed\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2: Vertical flow velocities (blue: downwelling; red: upwelling) around a cylinder atop a porous gravel bed and within the bed, with lines tracing the paths of the flow. x/D and y/D axes represent downstream and vertical distances with respect to the cylinder diameter, D.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Derek Lichtner</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;L&nbsp;Best</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mean vertical flow velocities around a cylinder atop a porous gravel bed and within the bed</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1215879/1215879_10185144_1482520417989_Velocitydistributionaboveandwithinagravel-bedriver--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1215879/1215879_10185144_1482520417989_Velocitydistributionaboveandwithinagravel-bedriver--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mean flow above an idealized gravel-bed river and within its pore spaces\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1215879/1215879_10185144_1482520417989_Velocitydistributionaboveandwithinagravel-bedriver--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mean flow above an idealized gravel-bed river and within its pore spaces\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: Mean flow above an idealized gravel-bed river and within its pore spaces.
