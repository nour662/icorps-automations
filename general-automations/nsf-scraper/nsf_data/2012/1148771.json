 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a recruitment network for mathematically talented students in community colleges in Maricopa County, Arizona, to help facilitate their successful transitions to baccalaureate programs in the mathematical sciences at Arizona State University (ASU).  This project, in addition to serving students in the Phoenix area, will serve as a model for universities elsewhere hoping to implement a successful transition program for community college students in the mathematical sciences.  Summer enrichment programs will be offered at Scottsdale Community College that will introduce students to topics in set theory and proofs, mathematical finance and biology, and computer graphics.  An 8-week summer research experience will be offered at ASU to qualified mathematical science majors, including alumni from the summer program at Scottsdale, to provide pre-professional experience to make them competitive for careers and selective graduate programs and associated fellowships in the mathematical sciences.  In addition, ASU mathematics faculty will develop \"project seminar\" courses, to be offered during the academic year, on mathematical problems related to weather prediction and atmospheric dynamics; image processing and Fourier analysis; network dynamics and graph theory; and mathematical models of cancer (especially brain and prostate cancer). This award is designed to provide opportunities to undergraduate mathematics majors to work as part of a team on an interdisciplinary problem; read journal articles to gain some background on a new subject quickly; analyze open-ended problems using computer simulation as a discovery tool; and present a talk or poster on their work at an appropriate workshop or research conference.\r\n\r\nArizona State University has one of the largest undergraduate mathematics programs in the United States.  This 5-year pilot project will engage approximately 38 mathematically talented students in the Maricopa County community colleges and 12 mathematics majors at ASU each year.  It seeks to provide a national model for other partnerships between community colleges and 4-year institutions to increase the number of undergraduate students with advanced training in mathematics and scientific computation.  Special efforts will be made to recruit students who are first-generation college students as well as students who are female and/or members of underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences.  All student participants will be U.S. citizens or permanent residents.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was a partnership between the Maricopa County (Arizona) Community College District (MCCCD) and Arizona State University (ASU).  The objective was to provide summer research experiences for students from each institution in applied mathematics.  To be eligible, studenst must have completed at least two semesters of calculus and analytic geometry prior to starting the program.  The MCCCD program was a half-day, 3-week program that introduced students to numerical simulation and computer programming, statistics, and mathematicsl modeling of competing populations.  The ASU program was 8 weeks in length and included more extensive projects in mathematical modeling of prostate and brain cancer; urban \"heat island\" effects in the Phoenix area; Fourier analysis and function approximation; and atmospheric modeiing, including the simulation of dust storms and related phenomena in Arizona weather.  The 8-week summer students were expected to prepare an oral and/or poster presentation of their work for the Joint Mathematics Meetings, a large professional research conference that is held every January.   About 60 oral and 20 poster presentations were given by students in this project at the Joint Mathematics Meetings and other conferences.\n\nOne objective of the program was to foster the matriculation of the MCCCD students to 4-year baccalaureate programs in mathematics, engineering, and physical and life sciences at ASU and other Arizona universities.  At this writing, about 65% of the 145 supported MCCCD students have transferred to 4-year programs.\n\nSeventy-six ASU students participated in 8-week summer research experiences under this award.  All of them have completed bachelor's degrees in mathematics or a closely related area or are on track to do so.  Several students have won national awards in part on the strength of their research experiences in this program; they include two Goldwater Scholarships (plus one finalist) and one National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.\n\nOther broader impacts of this project included the development of two new undergraduate courses in applied mathematics at ASU.  The first, Mathematics and Climate, addresses the solution and dynamics of the heat equation with particular emphasis on the effects of urbanization on summer night-time temperatures in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  The second, Mathematics and Cancer, discusses mathematical modeling of variious types of cancer and their treatment; specific examples include prostate and brain tumors.  In both cases, the project investigators have incorporated elements of the students' research experiences into these courses.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Kostelich"
