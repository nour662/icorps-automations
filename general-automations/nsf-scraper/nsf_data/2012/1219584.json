Because the S-STEM program provides limited support for dissemination and community interaction, it has been difficult for schools administering S-STEM scholarships to communicate and learn from each other. This project is bringing exemplary S-STEM principal investigators together with new S-STEM principal investigators and facilitating an exchange of lessons learned and best practices among projects. The face-to-face meeting of PIs is critical to generate a thorough exchange of ideas and the documentation of best practices that cannot be captured in other forms of gatherings. The meeting results are being disseminated nationally and therefore the meeting benefits not only the attendees but also all current and near future proposers.",
