 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Fundamental Neutron Physics'' is an experimental subfield of \"Fundamental Symmetries,\" which addresses core problems of particle physics through the use of precision measurements, often involving polarized atoms and nuclei.  These experiments generally use low-energy facilities and techniques including neutron beams, ultra-cold neutrons, polarized sources and and laser-physics  tools.  The Fundamental Neutron Physics Summer School has the aim of bringing together graduate students and young post docs entering the field with professionals who provide lectures that give a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and motivations, the basic principles and physics that underlie our understanding of the neutron sources and neutron beams, and specific topics represented by the suite of experiments ongoing and planned.  \r\n\r\nThe Fundamental Neutron Physics Summer School will take place as part of the TRIUMF Summer Institute (TSI 2012), August 6-16, 2012, at TRIUMF in Vancouver, BC.  The curriculum of TSI 2012 will include a broad introduction to the particle theory of the Standard Model and Beyond Standard Model Physics that motivates research in fundamental neutron physics, muon physics and neutron physics.  The fundamental neutron physics curriculum will include introductory material on neutron sources, neutron optics and polarization techniques.  From there, experiments including electric dipole moment (EDM), interferometry, gravitational interaction and hadronic parity violation will present the breadth of research currently underway as well as prospects for the future.  The capstone lecture will challenge the lecturer and students to consider where these fields will be a decade from now.  Thirty-one lectures will be presented by 24 lecturers.  In addition, homework and breakout discussion sections will round out the school.",
