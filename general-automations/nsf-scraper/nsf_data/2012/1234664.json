 "awd_abstract_narration": "The history of the nitrogen (N) cycle provides insight into the links between past climate and marine biogeochemical cycles. Interpretations of the history of the N cycle rely on the nitrogen isotopic composition (del15N) of Particulate Organic Nitrogen (del15N-PON) preserved in sedimentary \"archives\" such as: bulk organic nitrogen (ON) buried under suboxic/anoxic conditions in rapidly accumulating, organic-rich sediments; skeletal-bound ON in diatom frustules and foraminiferal tests, and organic skeletons of deep-sea proteinaceous corals. As is often is the case with paleo-proxies, these archives have distinct advantages and limitations, the latter including the restricted geographic occurrence of suboxic/anoxic sediments, limited temporal resolution due to bioturbation of sediments containing diatoms and foraminifera, and the limited time span for survival of the soft tissues of corals.  Therefore, a multi-proxy approach is highly desirable for better understanding the patterns and causes of N cycle variability in the past. \r\n\r\nTo improve upon the geographic and temporal resolution of del15N paleo-records, a scientist from Pomona College, collaborating with research groups from Claremont-McKenna College and Princeton University, will evaluate a new proxy for the history of the marine N cycle-- del15N of ON bound within the mineral lattice of deep-sea corals. Deep-sea corals can record both short-term regional and longer-term global variability in the N cycle. These organisms grow slowly, can be dated with a precision of <100 years, and have broad geographic distribution. Moreover, as demonstrated by previous research, the ON bound within the carbonate lattice is protected from diagenetic alteration. \r\n\r\nBy analyzing coral specimens from disparate oceanographic environments, each chosen to represent a distinct del15N signature of PON exported from the euphotic zone, the researchers will determine whether the del15N of coral-bound ON reflects N isotopic composition of PON exported from the surface ocean. Furthermore, time-resolved records of del15N of coral-bound ON will be generated in fossil scleractinian deep-sea corals of established ages and compared to published del15N records based on more traditional proxies on decadal to millennial time scales. Much uncertainty currently exists as to which of the pools of exported PON (suspended vs. sinking) is the main food source for deep-sea corals. This issue will be addressed by comparing the del15N of modern corals from variable depths to the del15N of both suspended and sinking PON pools collected during several one-day cruises to San Pedro basin, one of the California Borderland basins.\r\n\r\nFunding for this project will support two early career female scientists and several undergraduate student research assistants from Pomona College and the new Climate Science lab in the Keck Science Department (including Claremont McKenna, Scripps, and Pitzer Colleges). Students will have an opportunity to participate in short research cruises to the San Pedro basin, to be trained in advanced analytical techniques, and present research at conferences. The results of this study will be used as topics for senior theses and independent study projects, extending the educational experience by exposing undergraduate students to both practical and intellectual aspects of climate-focused research.",

With the fidelity of CB-del15N archive established, the research group generated a set of time-resolved records of del15N in fossil D. dianthus from the Subantarctic (south of Tasmania and northern Drake Passage) and Antarctic (southern Drake Passage) regions of the Southern Ocean, spanning 40Ka through the present (Figure 3, Wang et al., 2017). In the modern Southern Ocean, the surface nutrients (including nitrate) are not fully consumed, resulting in leakage of deeply sequestered CO2 to the atmosphere. Incomplete nitrate consumption is manifested in low del15N of exported PON. Wang et al. found that in both oceanographic regions the average CB-del15N during Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was 4 to 5 permil higher than today (Figure 3), providing a strong proof for a previously proposed hypothesis of the more efficient biological pump in this region, as likely a major mechanism driving lower pCO2 during the ice ages.

However, higher temporal resolution afforded by the DSC revealed a previously unnoticed feature: the CB-del15N in the Antarctic Zone continued to decrease through the Holocene, pointing to the ongoing decline in the nitrate uptake efficiency. One possible mechanism driving this change is the intensifying overturning of the Southern Ocean, which might have contributed to the rise in atmospheric pCO2 since 8 kyr, the Holocene change that remains to be explained.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts</p>\n<p>The grant supported two early career female scientists and partially supported a Ph.D. thesis.
