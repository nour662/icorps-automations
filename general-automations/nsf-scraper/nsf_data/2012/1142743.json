 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a methodology and novel algo-\r\nrithms for Personal Service Robotics. Recognizing that, in unstructured environments, autonomous robotics\r\nalone is not yet reliable enough for performing complete tasks, and complete manual teleoperation is too\r\nlabor intensive, this approach combines autonomous operation with human assistance in a Tiered Human-\r\nin-the-Loop framework. At all levels, the autonomy will request help when unexpected or anomalous events\r\noccur. For example, at high levels the user may be asked to identify objects or adjust plans. At the low level\r\nthe user may be asked to remote control the robot end-e\u000bector to unstick a wedged object. Automation\r\nwill focus on the most frequent task components, including motion planning, object grasping, and simple\r\nrigid-environment manipulation. The major innovations arise from (a) the design of limit-aware autonomy\r\nin each of these areas, requesting human intervention when needed and (b) multi-tiered human-assisted\r\nfallback options that necessitate greater involvement for severe failures or complex circumstances. Phase I\r\nwill demonstrate an operator assisting a robot completing personal service tasks in non-industrial environ-\r\nments. Phase II will parallelize for an operator supporting multiple robots, with the multiplicative e\u000bect\r\ndemonstrating overall labor savings.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes accelerating the deployment of robots\r\nin unstructured environments, extending the market for personal robotic services beyond single-purpose\r\nautonomous devices, and increasing access to in-home assistance in daily living for an aging population.\r\nWith demographics shifting to an older population, we face a major shortage of manual labor, particularly\r\nfor unskilled work. This will impact the o\u000ece and home environments, and dramatically a\u000bect the older\r\npopulation for whom daily tasks become increasingly burdensome, but also for whom appropriate service\r\nworkers may not be available. Allowing an operator to assist robots performing personal service tasks can\r\nincrease the productivity of such labor and perform greater personal service than traditionally possible.\r\nMeanwhile, customers are clearly ready to invest into robotic technology. For reference, even today's highly-\r\nlimited personal and home robots created a $1.28 Billion global market. A human-in-the-loop personal service\r\nrobot will greatly expand that market, as well as create markets for operator services and infrastructures.\r\nDelivering personal robotic service will have the immediate bene\fts of reduced labor costs and increased\r\nproductivity, while also allowing older adults to age in familiar housing and retain greater independence.",
