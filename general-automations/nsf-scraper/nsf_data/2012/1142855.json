 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project leverages the game changing\r\nTransformative Integrated Power Solution (TIPS?) power conversion technology, to\r\nbring a radical breakthrough to the traditional tradeoff between efficiency and circuit\r\nsize, pushing this figure of merit to a new frontier. By storing the required energy\r\nprimarily electrically (capacitive energy storage) rather than magnetically (inductive\r\nenergy storage), harnessing a 1000x improvement in energy density, and using the\r\nadiabatic (lossless) mechanism to charge and discharge the capacitors, the novel\r\nTIPS? power conversion architecture is able to deliver miniaturized products of 30X\r\nsmaller than the traditional approach, or cut the power losses due to conversion by 50-\r\n75%, at cost parity. The project proposes a radically novel systems architecture for the\r\ndata center market, and investigates the lower voltage end of the system, namely the\r\n12:1 step down ratio necessary for servers. To de-risk the commercialization path, this\r\nproject researches, designs and fabricates prototypes based on the TIPS? technology,\r\nby pushing the limit along three distinct dimensions: conversion efficiency, size, and\r\ncost. This project will generate a feasible 3D space of viable specifications to accelerate\r\nbringing this game changing technology to market.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project, enables commercial\r\npower conversion products, at no cost to the consumer, data center, or server\r\nmanufacturer, that can save $1 billion a year in electricity cost, amounting to annual\r\nsavings of 7 million tons of CO2 emissions worldwide. Data centers emit more heat and\r\ngreen house gasses than the entire airline industry worldwide. By 2020, data centers?\r\nenergy consumption will exceed 200 billion kWhr per year. While server equipment\r\nspending has been declining, electricity spending has increased 10 fold over the last\r\nfifteen years, approaching $50 billion annually. More than 50% of this cost is due to\r\npower conversion losses and the resultant cooling needs. The TIPS? power converter\r\ntechnology can cut these power losses by 50%. Additionally, by enhancing the scope\r\nand technological understanding of this novel technology, and by making power\r\nconversion more efficient, significant value flows to numerous other markets, such as\r\nincreased battery life in Mobile Devices ($3 billion), more power generated by Solar\r\nCells (<$1 billion), extended driving range of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles ($0.2 billion),\r\nno standby losses in consumer electronics ($6 billion), and reduced component count\r\nand higher reliability in the Industrial and Measurement sector ($4 billion).",
