The institute will be held in Xi'an, China, and the event will capitalize upon two major opportunities. The first is the opening of a major interdisciplinary center at Xi'an Jiaotong University, with a 20 million RMB in-vestment by the Chinese NSF. The second is the International Congress on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ICTAM) to be held the following week in Beijing. This will allow us to attract participants, al-ready visiting China, at a fraction of the usual cost. The workshop will aim to prepare young investigators for the ICTAM both in terms of science, by presenting recent developments and ongoing research themes in cellular biomechanics, and in terms of networking, by enabling meaningful interactions between young US investigators and both their Chinese counterparts and senior investigators. Careful evaluation of the institute will be performed to optimize offerings and program structure for future years.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\nMuch of modern medicine builds upon successes in understanding the cell as a biochemical system. The marriage between cell biology and engineering principles is much newer, and the identification of governing principles underlying physiological and pathological function of cells represents a grand challenge that may lead to a new generation of medical treatments. Prominent examples of cellular pathologies that are biophysical as well as biochemical in origin include fibrosis, asthma, many metastatic cancers, cardiac arrhythmia, and cystic fibrosis. This workshop will bring together established experts and young investigators from around the world to present both a short course and the latest research on topics of central importance to this emerging field. The successes and failures of the workshop to achieve this goal will be assessed carefully through a survey to be completed by both US and international participants.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe broader impacts of this summer institute lie in the development of students and young investigators. The summer institute aims to inspire and motivate students and young investigators to gain expertise in and make contributions to this important area. The summer institute will afford ample opportunity for students to interact with internationally leading professors both scientifically and socially. The summer institute is timed to allow visiting students and young investigators to make connections in China, and to build upon these connections in a meaningful way not only over the course of the summer institute but also over the following week for those who travel to Beijing and attend the International Congress on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. The summer institute aims to help young investigators maximize career development opportunities at this conference by providing them comfortable foundations of both scientific background and networking.",
