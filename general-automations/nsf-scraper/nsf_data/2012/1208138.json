 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n1207466, Akay\r\n\r\nThe biological sciences have become more quantitative and information-driven science since emerging computational and mathematical tools facilitate collection and analysis of vast amounts of biological data. Complexity analysis of biological systems provides biological knowledge for the organization, management and mining of biological data by using advanced computational tools. The biological data are inherently complex and non-uniform and collected at multiple temporal and spatial scales. The investigations of complex biological systems and processes require an extensive collaboration between biologists, mathematicians, computer scientists and engineering to improve our understanding of complex biological process from gene to system.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: The main objective of these summer schools is to expose undergraduate and graduate biological science and bioengineering students to the relatively new approaches of Health Informatics, Regenerative Medicine, Personalized Medicine. This summer school will be helpful, also, to students in computer science and mathematics who are interested in pursuing research in biology, bio-molecular engineering and bioengineering, since the summer school provides exceptional insights into the fundamental challenges in biological sciences.\r\n\r\nBroader Imapcts: The summer school uses lectures, oriented toward biological science students, by expert faculty and will focus on the Health Informatics, Regenerative Medicine, Personalized Medicine. In addition to these lectures, the summer school will employ 2 two-hour panel discussion, with active participation of undergraduate and graduate students, focused on Engineering Better Medicines and Advances in Biomedical Engineering Research and Education in the World. The summer school will stimulate further interdisciplinary research and collaborations among engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, and medical researchers, and will help in identifying new, challenging directions in complex biological science and bioengineering research.",
