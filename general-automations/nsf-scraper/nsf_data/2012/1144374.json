 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a joint research center in fusion and astro-plasma physics involving two units within Princeton University (the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, PPPL, and the Department of Astrophysical Sciences) and three institutes within the Max Planck Society (MPS) (the Institute of Plasma Physics at Garching and Greifswald, the Institute for Astrophysics at Garching, and the Institute for Solar System Research at Lindau).\r\n\r\nThe major research goal of the center is to harness the expertise and resources of both the fusion and astrophysical plasma communities to tackle fundamental problems that impede progress in both communities. Such problems include understanding the process of magnetic reconnection, the generation and transport of energetic (superthermal) particles in collisionless shocks, and the generation and dissipation of turbulence in magnetized plasmas. Research conducted at the center will advance our understanding in many areas of theoretical plasma astrophysics, fusion physics, basic plasma experiments, and tokamaks.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, the joint center will foster interdisciplinary collaboration between the plasma and astrophysics communities, both nationally and internationally. It will forge new collaborations between Universities, the national fusion labs, and international partners. It will leverage the tools and expertise developed independently in both communities (for example, laboratory experiments and sophisticated computer codes) in order to address fundamental research questions. It will provide international research collaboration opportunities for postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students, and provide opportunities for students and teachers at high-schools, local, and regional institutions to engage in scientific inquiry in ways that enhance their understanding of science concepts and scientific ways of thinking through a well established outreach program at PPPL.\r\n\r\nThis award has been designated as a Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) award and is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nWe have built a very large and successful international collaboration\nbetweeen astrophysicists and fusion plasma scientists to tackle the most pressing problems in astrophysical and fusion plasma physics. The collaboration is unique in that it involves scientists in both the US (at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University) as well as in Germany (at various institutes of the Max Planck Society).  The collaboration is organized as an internation center: the Max Planck-Princeton Center (MPPC) for plasma science.\n\nThe MPPC is unique in that it leverages the unique tools and expertise of scientists in both nations.  Thus, scientists in the US have access to unique plasma experiments built and run in Germany, while German scientists can compare and model their results using advanced diagnostics and computer codes developed in the US.  We have developed new computational tools that we are now making available to the rest of the community.  We have begun new partnerships to use joint experimental facilities in the US and Germany, including the MRI experiment at PPPL.  The special tools and expertise that each partner brings to the collaboration enables new results and progress not possible otherwise.\n\nThe four major research topics that we have been studied in the MPPC are magnetic reconnection, the production of energetic particles, plasma turbulence, and plasma astrophysics.  SIgnificant new results have been obtained in each area, as demonstrated by the large number refereed research papers that have been published by the collaboration.  We have also built webpages to help desseminate our results, and provide information and training to the public about fusion science and plasma astrophysics.\n\nWe have hosted three large international conferences and workshops to disseminate our results, and involve scientists who are not members of the MPPC.  Two of these were held in Princeton in the US, and one in Garching in Germany.  Each workshop hosted invited speakers from around the world.\n\nThe MPPC has been very active in outreach and training in STEM fields.  For example, it has successfully involved undergraduates in research projects through an existing Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at both PPPL and PU in projects mentored by MPPC post-docs.  For example, in the summer of 2014 alone, 10 undergraduate students in astrophysics were involved in a summer mentoring program co-directed by a MPPC postdoc.  Members of the MPPC are developing new university courses at PU desinged to introduce advanced undergraduate students to plasma physics.  The science and technology components of the plasma astrophysics research conducted at the center also provide educational and research opportunities for a diverse group of high school students and teachers, with a particular emphasis on encouraging participation from disadvantaged or underrepresented groups.  Specifically, over 2200 young women have participated in PPPL\u00c6s Young Women\u00c6s Conferences (YWC) since 2002, and the MPPC helps sponsor these with the goal of introducing young women to the diverse science and applications of plasma physics.  Finally, in 2016 the MPPC is sponsoring a summer school at Princeton in \"Computational Plasma Astrophysics\" for over 100 students from around the world.\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/21/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James M Stone"
