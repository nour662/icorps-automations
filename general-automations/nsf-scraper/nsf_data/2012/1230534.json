 "awd_abstract_narration": "How are formulaic narrative structures for life stories and conventional discourses about society incorporated, adapted, and changed during a time of personal and national difficulties? To answer this question, Dr. Claudia Strauss (Pitzer College) will undertake longitudinal research among unemployed American workers to see if their sociopolitical outlooks and ways of narrating their life shift as a result of either continued unemployment or subsequent re-employment. Qualitative research among the jobless in the United States has typically consisted of community studies following a plant closing. Today, however, plant closings are less common as a cause of unemployment. Furthermore, while unemployment benefits took care of the immediate needs of most of the jobless in the past, around half of currently jobless Americans have exhausted their unemployment benefits and are experiencing high levels of financial hardship.   American workers once interpreted their own and others' economic situations through the belief that economic opportunities are readily available, so individuals are responsible for their economic fate. This project asks to what extent is that still the case?  \r\n\r\nThe researcher will follow displaced workers in Southern California for a period of two years and use a mix of qualitative research methods to collect narratives for analysis. She will conduct participant-observation in networking groups for the jobless. She will complete in-depth interviews with 60 jobless workers, selected to represent a variety of socioeconomic levels and ethnic backgrounds, including immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America, as well as native born Americans. She will stay in contact with her interviewees over the course of the study and re-interview them at its conclusion. The data collected will be analyzed to determine what interpretive frameworks workers are using to understand the current economy and their position in it. The researcher will be looking for change and variability in formulaic ways of talking about job situations, possibly reflecting more inchoate understandings that reflect current realities.  \r\n\r\nFindings from this research will contribute to greater understanding of how personal narratives and sociopolitical opinions are constructed from formulaic elements. The research will also help to understand coping strategies of the unemployed and the kinds of conventional narratives that may give them practical help, as well as the potential for exacerbating social tensions. In addition, funding this research provides undergraduate and graduate student research training.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research investigated how unemployed southern Californians interpreted their experience of being out of work in the aftermath of the Great Recession.  My findings are relevant to debates about the meaning of work in the United States.\n\nMy participants were an ethnically diverse set of 64 men and women recruited at job fairs, networking group meetings, career counseling sessions, and through personal contacts.  About half formerly had middle-class household incomes; the rest were divided between upper- and lower-income groups.  The majority were among the long-term unemployed, having been out of work for six months or longer when my research assistant and I first met them between the fall of 2011 and summer of 2012.  After two or more initial interviews with each person, I conducted a follow-up interview two years later to learn the outcome of their job search and their further reflections on the experience of being out of work.\n\nCommentary about Americans\u00c6 work values typically focuses on the Protestant Work Ethic.  It often misses subtleties in that concept and does not provide a complete picture of the meaning of work at the present time or how contemporary Americans react to long-term unemployment.  Most of my interviewees took pride in being hard workers, but for many it was sufficient to stay busy, and they could keep busy in a number of ways (e.g., networking to find another job, caring for children and elderly relatives, volunteering in the community, taking unpaid jobs, and exercising) if they were unable to find paid work.  Another supposed social norm regarding work in the United States is the importance of economic self-reliance.  While my interviewees had been self-supporting for decades, most were able to adapt to dependence on family members or government social welfare once that became a necessity.  Many devout Christians among my interviewees believed God cared for them whether they worked or not and had a plan for them that included their period of unemployment.  Those who did not believe in God held that everything happens for a good reason.  These beliefs sustained them through long-term unemployment.\n\nNearly half of my participants were 55 or older, and my research draws attention to their plight, caught between a labor market that considers them too old to be hired and Social Security policies that classify them as too young to retire.  In addition to the financial strain that affected all of my participants, there were certain groups for whom unemployment particularly threatened important values and identities.  Foremost were those for whom a high income and commensurate lifestyle were a significant source of personal and social esteem.  They reported the greatest degree of social stigma. They also imagined possible scenarios of extreme destitution more than those who had fewer resources.  A second group consisted of those men who believed it was their duty to provide for their family.  My interviewees included many women who had been the primary breadwinners in their households, but for them the economic necessity of finding another job was not mixed with gender role anxiety as it was for some of my male participants.  Also adversely affected were those who lived alone and enjoyed going to a workplace for the social interaction it provided.  Unemployment was also particularly difficult for members of stigmatized groups, including ex-offenders, who felt deprived of the opportunity to contribute to society and enjoy a full sense of social belonging.  Finally, there were those who had truly loved their work and missed doing what they considered a personal calling. \n\nUnemployment rates in the U.S. have returned to pre-Recession levels, but that is in part because many working-age Americans have stopped looking for work.  Labor force participation has fallen to a three-decade low and long-term labor market trends are not encouraging due to advances in artificial intelligence along with ongoing processes..."
