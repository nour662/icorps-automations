TICOP will be a rare opportunity for many of the 200 members of the Permafrost Young Researchers Network to meet and develop their own plans for this new generation of permafrost researchers. By sending young researchers to Russia, the PI hopes to open doors for a whole new generation or researchers to begin conducting research in Russia and to develop personal knowledge and personal contacts with researchers abroad, which can be later instrumental to the success of a research program.",
