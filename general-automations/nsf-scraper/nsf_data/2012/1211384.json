 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a theoretical project to model the interior conditions of several stellar types in which magnetic fields may play an important role.  These are rapidly rotating A-type stars, low-mass M-type stars, and stars formed early in the history of the universe.  Dr. Chaboyer will create a new generation of stellar interior models that perform computations in two spatial dimensions, with the goal of capturing important physics that is missing from common one-dimensional models.\r\n\r\nThe new theoretical models will be made widely available to the community, thereby broadening the software infrastructure that modelers can take advantage of.  Graduate students will receive training in astrophysics and computational methods, and the PI will continue ongoing outreach efforts directed at K-8 students.",
