 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is reforming a conceptual physics course for large numbers of future elementary teachers.  Pedagogical content knowledge is woven into the fabric of the course so that future elementary teachers recognize the interdependence of learning physics concepts and the use of reform-based pedagogy in their future roles in the classroom. While promoting active learning of both the science concepts and pedagogy, the effort goes well beyond modeling inquiry-based teaching of science.  More importantly, this course provides opportunities for future teachers to develop and build upon their own metacognitive skills and perspectives as they reflect on their own learning of physical phenomena, understand how children talk and learn about physical phenomena, and become more aware of how the research literature describes ways in which children think about physical phenomena. It also facilitates the application of a developing understanding of integrated content and pedagogy as these future instructors seek to develop age-appropriate lesson plans for teaching physical science concepts within an elementary science classroom. Further, these future teachers are able to demonstrate positive improvements on surveys that measure their understandings of science and the framework of their own beliefs about learning science.  As a result of this course, statistically significant increases are anticipated in the number of future elementary teachers concentrating in science at Kansas State University.\r\n\r\nThe project brings together a team of experienced discipline-based STEM education researchers with teacher educators as they develop strategies that integrate the learning of science and pedagogy in a large enrollment course. The resulting instructional approach (being developed and tested) moves toward a fully developed course model for consideration and dissemination within other large enrollment pre-service teacher science classes in the U.S. The institutionalization of this project ensures that it will continue to produce a cadre of capable elementary teachers who choose to concentrate in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal was to infuse knowledge about how to teach physics topics (called pedagogical content knowledge or PCK) and reflection on the students? own learning into a physics course for future elementary teachers.  To achieve this goal we: \n\ndeveloped, implemented and tested units based on an instructional      model in which the students first learn the content and then study how      young children think about the same concepts.  Each component of this instructional      model was based on a learning cycle which provided opportunities for      students to  \n\nreflect on their own learning and the learning of       elementary school children,\nbecome knowledgeable about research on children?s       ideas of science,\ndevelop and critique strategies based on their       knowledge of children?s learning of science,\n\n\nexpanded the emphasis of the course to pedagogy and its      transferability to teaching situations in elementary school,\ndeveloped and adapted strategies to assess students? learning,      attitudes and beliefs about learning and teaching science, and\ndisseminated the results of the project.\n\n\nThe project had both development and research components.\n\nDEVELOPMENT:\n\nThe instructional model for the course was a three part learning cycle -- Exploration, Explanation and Elaboration.  This 3E cycle begins with students using activities to explore ideas that are new to them, learning through an explanation about a physics concept which provides a structure for understanding the observations of the exploration and finally elaborating on the physics by applying it to new situations. \n\nThe materials developed include:\n\nWorksheets for students to use in the Exploration and Elaboration phases.\nLectures to be used in the Explanation phase as well as after the completion of the Elaboration phase.  These lectures include clicker questions which, in addition to the physics concepts, also focus on pedagogical content such as strategies to facilitate younger learners to learn the concepts.\nInstructional strategy guides for teaching assistants to facilitate student learning, especially during the Exploration and Elaboration activities.  These guides focus on questioning strategies to elicit student prior knowledge.  Additionally, these guidelines included Socratic dialog strategies to facilitate student learning.\n\n\nRESEARCH:\n\nWe addressed two research questions.\n\nHow does knowledge of children?s ideas and incorporation of that knowledge in instructional design and assessment from students in the redesigned course compare with comparable evidence from students in the original course?\nTo what extent does the level of sophistication of the knowledge and use of children?s ideas in micro-lessons, lesson plans, and critiques change during the course.\n\n\nTo address these questions we collected data from videos of lectures and students? micro-lessons; and from work such as exams, laboratory activities, lesson plans and critiques.  These data were analyzed using both qualitative and statistical methods.\n\nResearch question 1: Comparisons of the student lesson plans and critiques for the redesigned physics course (Fall 2014) and the baseline physics course (Fall 2011) showed no significant differences between the two groups of students concerning their knowledge of children?s ideas but significant differences for the inclusion of those ideas in instructional design and assessment. Lesson plans and critiques developed in the redesigned course showed higher levels of sophistication in the incorporation of those ideas than the lesson plans and critiques developed in the baseline course.\n\nResearch question 2: Comparisons of the three micro-lessons and final project videos created in the redesigned physics course (Fall 2014) showed significant differences in students? knowledge of children?s ideas and use of those ideas in assessment strategies, but no significant differences in use of those ideas in instructional strategies. Pairwise comparisons of the micro-lessons (ML) and final project video (ML1 with ML2; ML2 with ML3; and ML3 with final project video) did not show consistent improvement from one assignment to the next, suggesting that there may be an interaction between students? familiarity with the physics content addressed in each micro-lesson assignment and students? ability to integrate children?s ideas into the assignment.\n\nConclusion:  Evidence suggests that the inclusion of a week of instruction dedicated to a discussion of children?s ideas about each physics concepts being explored led to student work that demonstrated a higher level of sophistication of the use of those ideas in instructional design and assessment than those produced in an earlier course in which children?s ideas were only mentioned as part of the physics content.
