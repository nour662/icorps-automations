Current DSSC technology faces limitations from significant photogenerated charge recombination losses at the photoanode-electrolyte interface. Central to this research is the hypothesis that higher power conversion efficiencies will be obtained by reducing major losses in electrical conduction within the photoanode and electrolyte of the cell. A holistic approach will be taken where a first principles solid-state DSSC mathematical model will provide a detailed understanding of charge transport behavior, which will then efficiently guide the design and fabrication of effective photoanodes and electrolytes that mitigate recombination losses. This approach is expected to lead to design of new energy materials, fabrication of optimized next generation DSSCs with significantly higher solar cell efficiency above current state-of-the-art, and optimal operation and integration of the cells. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to design and test a highly-efficient DSSC array through model-based optimal design, integration and operation. The proposed study will be conducted using the integrated research strategy. The specific goals of this project are: (a) Develop a detailed macroscopic first principles mathematical model of solid-state DSSCs. (b) Using the developed predictive model, search the DSSC design parameter space systematically to arrive at an optimal design of DSSCs. (c) Investigate the effect of electrophoretic deposition parameters on the structure and composition of TiO2-carbon nanotube (CNT) composites. (d) Study initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) synthesis and processing conditions on pore filling and resulting polymer structure and properties. (e) Fabricate and characterize DSSCs integrating iCVD polymer electrolytes and hole conductors. (f) Fabricate and characterize solid-state DSSCs incorporating TiO2/CNT photoanodes and iCVD polymer electrolytes and hole conductors.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project is expected to benefit society as a whole as we gain a predictive model for creating enhanced energy materials as well as the necessary components for significantly increasing DSSC efficiency above the current ~11% which has been the record for the past 15 years, and approach the theoretical limit of ~30%. In addition, the fundamental knowledge of model and materials development has practical applications in other energy devices such as in fuel cells, supercapacitors and batteries. The ability to create viable, lighter and less expensive polymer and organic based solar cells is expected to establish a strong intellectual property position for replacing silicon technology, and open the door to flexible photovoltaics. The PIs and Co-PI will train and mentor one pre-doctoral and one Master?s research assistants as well as six undergraduate (REU) and several local high school students. The students will participate in broad range of research activities from mathematical modeling to synthesis, processing and characterization. The PIs also plan to be actively involved in various outreach scientific and technological events and activities in the Philadelphia area. The project results will be released to the public at conferences and in journal and conference proceedings papers.",
