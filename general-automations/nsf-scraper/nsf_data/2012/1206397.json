 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThe reorientation of defects can affect technologically important macroscopic properties of solids like hysteresis losses in electric steels. This project will investigate the magnetostriction caused by the reorientation of the magnetization of coherent nano-precipitates of lower symmetry than the host. Iron-cobalt alloys will serve as the model system for the investigation as preliminary microscopic and macroscopic evidence exists in Fe40Co60, which demonstrates that its large magnetostriction, lambda100=200ppm, is due to this mechanism. The insight gained will be used to develop new alloys with enhanced magnetostriction. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThe project proposes to investigate the magnetostriction of two phase functional materials, predominantly metallic alloys. Materials displaying low anisotropy and large magnetostriction will be emphasized as they are very suitable for technological applications such as sensors or transducers. Additionally, through this collaborative research, graduate and undergraduate minorities will be trained in materials synthesis and state-of-the-art characterization techniques. The proposed research will increase the competitiveness of minority students in the Science and Engineering disciplines and expand the pool of talented African-American scientists and engineers, who will enlarge the high-technology minority workforce. The planned outreach to Maryland high schools will ensure that the proposed research connects to the potentially interested segment of the high school population.",
