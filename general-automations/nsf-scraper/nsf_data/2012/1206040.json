 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this quantum nonlinear optics research program is to study a new type of light-matter interface, realized by laser driving cold atoms, that has very large coupling strength, low absorption, and long atomic coherence times. It arises due to the simultaneous action of Sisyphus cooling of the atoms and atomic bunching in wavelength-scale structures. Fields self-generated by the light-matter interaction have a large affect on the center-of-mass motion of the atoms in a single pass through the medium, giving rise to self-assembled spatial structures in the absence of a cavity. These structures act back on the fields, giving rise to long coherence times, slow light, and quantum optical patterns arising from an absolute instability (phase transition). The investigators are using this light-matter interface to: 1) Observe a low-light-level (potentially single-photon) nonlinear phase shift when the laser-driven gas is placed in an interferometer; 2) Measure the quantum statistical properties of the radiation scattered by the driven gas of atoms near the phase transition to test recent predictions of an associated Dicke-like model; 3) Measure spontaneous pattern formation in the driven gas and correlate to the atomic spatial reorganization; 4) Observe three-dimensional (3D) Sisyphus cooling when pumping the gas with counterpropagating Bessel beams, thereby dramatically increasing the quantum coherence time of the interaction; 5) Develop a self-consistent model of the light matter interaction that accounts for propagation of the optical fields, polarization of the atoms, center-of-mass atomic motion, and Sisyphus cooling in 3D; and 6) Extend the free-space Dicke-like model to account for the new physics found in this system.  This work will provide new experimental and theoretical understanding of a unique physical system that has applications to quantum nonlinear optics, especially in the development of single-photon nonlinear interactions and the study of classical and quantum phase transitions in a well-controlled environment. The program has also has implications for the study of far-from equilibrium quantum phase transitions, cold-atom physics, and condensed matter physics.\r\n    \r\nBroader Impact: From a broad perspective, the program has the potential to improve the performance of nonlinear optical devices by increasing the nonlinear optical sensitivity making it possible to shrink the size of the device and lower the power requirements. From an educational perspective, the program will results in the training of two graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment in both experimental and theoretical techniques in the enabling field of optical physics.  It is noteworthy that the PI has been very effective in mentoring women and minority scientists and has undertaken substantial outreach in the local area elementary and middle schools to help attract more people to the science disciplines.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the course of this project, the researchers studied new methods to enhance the interaction between light and atoms for applications in nonlinear optics and quantum information science.  In particular, they discovered that the synergistic interaction between light and ultra-cold (in the microKelvin regime) rubidium atoms gives rise to the spatial bunching of atoms simultaneously occurring with the creating of optical patterns.   This mutual interaction gives rise to additional cooling of the atoms, which in turn lowers the optical power needed to observe the patterns.  The fundamental research is important because it provides a path toward single-photon nonlinear optics, where a single photon can change the propterties of another photon through their mutual interaction with the ultra-cold atoms.  In the future, this may have implications in the field of quantum information science, which relies on the manipulation of single photon states.  To achieve these results, the researchers developed a novel method for cooling and trapping rubidium atoms in a small vacuum chamber, where the atoms are localized in a highly anisotropic geometry.  In this case, light scattered by the atoms has a low probabilty of interacting with other atoms in the sample, thereby leading to unutually low temperatures without any additional cooling methods.  This experimental approach is being adopted by others in the research field.  In terms of human resource development, this project provided training for two female graduate students and one female undergraduate student in the enabling field of atomic, molecular, and optical physics.  The students are trained in both state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical methods in optical physics.  One of the graduate student scompleted her PhD disseration during the program and is now a post-doctoral research associate at the Joint Quantum Institute at NIST/University of Maryland.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel J Gauthier"
