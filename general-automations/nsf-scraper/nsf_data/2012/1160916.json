 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to investigate adaptive control techniques for nonlinear systems under minimal modeling information.  The basis of this work is retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC), which is applicable to linear systems under extremely limited modeling information.  The goal is to extend this approach to nonlinear systems.  A prototypical case is a linear system preceded by an uncertain input nonlinearity, such as a deadzone or saturation.  The novel component of this project is the use of ersatz nonlinear models, which capture key features of the otherwise uncertain nonlinearity in order to ensure correct adaptation.  For example, the only reliable information about the true nonlinearity may be its monotonicity, that is, intervals within which it is increasing or decreasing.  The ersatz nonlinearity then captures this behavior, but may be otherwise incorrect in all other details.  The research goal is thus to determine the features of the nonlinearities whose knowledge is essential to RCAC.\r\n\r\nControl systems that affect humans must be extremely reliable since their failure can endanger lives and property.  Unfortunately, control systems are often unable to operate under emergency conditions, which is, ironically, the times when they are often most needed. Humans control vehicles and machines without using computers, but rather by learning from experience as the system operates. Our goal is thus to extend this ability to computers, which lack the intuition about the real world that humans possess. The ability of computers to adaptively control a vehicle or machine will increase the reliability of the control system, which may be crucial in an emergency situation, such as when an automobile brakes on an icy road or an airplane experiences a failure.  An additional benefit of this research is the reduced time and cost needed to implement reliable control systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany technological systems (such as vehicles and machines) require feedback control for their operation.  Examples include autopilots for aircraft and spacecraft, which are implemented by onboard computers.  A feedback controller must operate reliability in order to ensure the safety of the vehicle and its occupants.\n\nA feedback controller uses measurements from the system in order to compute control inputs for actuation.  These inputs include forces and moments that are applied to the system in order to modify its motion.  The feedback controller must account for the dynamics of the system it is controlling as well as the effect of the environment.  This project focused on the development of an adaptive feedback controller called retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC).  RCAC is an adaptive feedback control algorithm due to its ability to respond to unexpected changes in the system and environment. \n\nThe goal of this project was to improve the performance and reliability of RCAC.  In particular, the goal was to understand which aspects of the system need to be modeled in order to ensure that RCAC will operate reliably.  These aspects include the accuracy of key modeling details such as nonlinearities that are present in the system.  A major advance achieved in this project is a deeper understanding of RCAC in terms of these modeling details.  This understanding is critical since it can guide engineers in setting the parameters needed to implement the adaptive feedback control algorithm in computer software. \n\nIn order to better understand how RCAC operates on realistic systems, we carried out numerical studies involving aircraft, spacecraft, and engines.  We also performed laboratory experiments involving active noise control.  Our studies show that RCAC can potentially enhance the performance of these systems.  To further demonstrate this technology, we implemented RCAC on an automobile to test its ability to actively suppress noise in the interior of the vehicle.  We also tested RCAC in numerical simulation studies of satellites as well as scramjet engines.\n\nThe research under this project was performed by graduate students.  These students performed computer and laboratory studies.  They wrote papers reporting their research, and they presented these papers at major conferences.  These activities helped prepare these students for professional careers as engineers in major companies.\n\nThe research under this project helped advance RCAC and move it toward real-world applications.  Although more testing and development is needed, RCAC has shown promise and potential to be a key component of future technological systems that depend on feedback control technology.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dennis S Bernstein"
