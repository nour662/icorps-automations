 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Jeffrey Wayne Streicher of The University of Texas at Arlington to conduct a research project, entitled \"Genetic consequences of forest fragmentation in two frog species from Singapore,\" during the summer of 2012 at National University of Singapore in Singapore.  The host scientist is Dr. David Bickford.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is that it provides a valuable commentary on the effects of deforestation in a tropical region with high levels of biodiversity. Using populations of frog species from the heavily urbanized country of Singapore, rates and patterns of gene flow are being characterized among several discontinuous forest fragments.   \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
