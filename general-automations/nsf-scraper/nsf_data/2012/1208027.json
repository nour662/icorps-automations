 "awd_abstract_narration": "Circuits across the brain display correlated activity, in which the responses among neurons are coordinated at a level beyond that expected from the stimulus structure itself.  What role does such correlated activity play in neural coding?  The retina provides a strong opportunity for progress:  widespread correlated activity is generated by key circuit mechanisms that recur throughout the brain.  Moreover, the impact of these mechanisms can be studied in the context of stimuli with clear functional significance.  Nevertheless, circuit-level nonlinearities at multiple locations cause retinal outputs to depend on stimuli in a manner that defies traditional filter-based models. This demands a tightly coupled computational and experimental approach:  purely computational attacks will become lost in the combinatorics of all possible circuit configurations at the difficult \"mesoscales\" relevant to retinal computation, where averaging approaches fail; purely experimental strategies cannot predict and prioritize the most critical circuit mechanisms and stimulus parameters to explore.  The investigators apply this interdisciplinary approach to the mechanisms producing correlated activity in directionally-selective (DS) ganglion cells.  In particular, they determine how convergent and divergent pathways in the DS cell circuit interact to shape correlations and encoded information across the cell population, and asses the possible roles of recurrent coupling in modulating this process.  These circuit features are the basis of correlated activity in many retinal pathways, and in circuits throughout the brain.  Thus, our findings will guide studies of collective neural computation and dynamics currently under intense study in a variety of domains. \r\n\r\nThe brain translates the sensory environment into its own code, that of neural spikes distributed across vast numbers of neurons.  Neuroscience seeks to understand the nature of this code -- what aspects of the spiking activity carry what information, how it is implemented by the cellular hardware of the brain, and how this process can fail in disease.  A key puzzle is deciphering what it means when many neurons spike simultaneously -- is this just inevitable statistical coincidence, an artifact of neural hardware, or a key symbol in the code?  The investigators take a direct approach to answering this question in the earliest stage of the visual pathway, the retina.  Here, the team rigorously combines experiment and theory to connect biological circuit mechanisms and coding, and to identify principles that could be tested in other brain areas.  Matching the interdisciplinary demands of this endeavor, investigators from Applied Mathematics and Physiology and Biophysics will unite, and will mentor a small team of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers with diverse backgrounds including both mathematics and biology. They will share their results with peers through an open, user-friendly database, and their most exciting findings with students in the interdisciplinary courses that they teach.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe brain encodes sensory information through the spiking activity of vast numbers of neurons.  Intriguingly, this spiking code is highly variable, with different responses occurring each time the same stimulus is presented.  How does neural circuitry cope with this variability to produce accurate sensory percepts and sensory-based behavior?  \n\nThe initial visual area of the brain, the retina, provides an excellent opportunity to address this question.  The retina is a multilayered neural circuit of intertwined diverging and converging pathways, with many features that are repeated throughout the nervous system.  Moreover, variable activity at multiple stages of retinal circuits can be measured while stimuli of clear physiological significance are presented.  Further, variability in retinal signaling is known to have a direct impact on how well we can see.  To take advantage of this opportunity, we formed a highly interdisciplinary team of neuroscientists and applied mathematicians to investigate the origins and implications of noisy neural codes in the retina and beyond.\n\nThe first topic that we investigated is collective nature of the neural code.  Put directly, we asked:  is the information carried about sensory signals more (or less) than the sum of the information carried in the individual parts?  To begin, we investigated the extent to which variable responses to sensory stimuli are coordinated from one retinal neuron to the next.  We focussed on the family of direction selective retinal ganglion cells, and came to an intriguing set of results.  First, responses in these cells are in fact highly coordinated (measured by strong correlations).  Second, the way they are correlated reorients the overall noise in retinal responses to be orthogonal to the directions in which signal is carried.  The consequence is that the collective response of retinal ganglion cells carries much more information than would have been inferred by extrapolating information carried by individual cells.  Third, this phenomena arises from a broadly general mechanism &mdash; diverging, stimulus-tuned excitatory and inhibitory inputs to multiple cells &mdash; that is common to many other neural circuits.  \n\nTo more broadly interpret and apply our results on collective encoding in retinal circuits, we described mathematically the key signatures of the collective coding phenomenon that we found in direction selective retinal ganglion cell circuits.  This suggests that signal-dependent correlations, which have often been neglected in the literature, are a key factor.  Moreover, we established new results showing that there are few purely mathematical restrictions on when the property of orthogonal signal and noise is expected to occur statistically, focussing the question of collective coding on broader information processing constraints.  One of these is the need to propagate signals through further layers of noisy circuitry downstream, which we showed places surprising new constraints on neural codes.\n\nThe second topic that we investigated is how nonlinear processing stages in neural circuits impact the levels of information that they carry.  We showed that the answer is intimately connected to the properties of variability (noise) in circuit responses, including how signal and noise diverge and converge among multiple pathways.  Moreover, we showed that the location in these circuits where the noise originates has a surprisingly strong impact.  This makes testable predictions for retinal circuits.  For example, under low vs. high light conditions, different noise sources - occurring upstream vs. downstream of primary circuit nonlinearities - are believed to dominate.  Our mathematical and computational results on maximal information transmission suggest that this should lead to shallow vs. sharply rectified circuit nonlinearities under these light conditions.  We developed, refined, and extensively tested a new statistical inference model that is capable of identifying not just overall noise levels in neural responses, but of assigning this noise to one of three locations with respect to circuit nonlinearities.  When applied to retinal data, this gives a new and explicit test of whether and how neural circuits adapt key processing stages to maximize transmitted information.\n\nOur work makes new connections among biology, mathematics, and statistics, and as such provided the involved graduate students and postdocs with intensely interdisciplinary training.  These trainees received joint mentorship from PIs across the disciplines, and attended premier interdisciplinary summer schools to broaden this training.  Research findings were shared with a broader set of graduates and postdocs in a university course, and with summer school attendees over multiple years and on both coasts.  Likewise, research lectures and tutorials in forums such as early vision meetings brought highly mathematical results to advanced audiences with primary training in biology, and in forums such as physics colloquia brought cutting-edge methods and questions in biology to audiences with backgrounds in the mathematical and physical sciences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric T Shea-Brown"
