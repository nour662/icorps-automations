 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to organize a two-day conference in frontiers of numerical analysis and scientific computing in Kent State University in April 2013. The topics of this conference include (1) fast iterative solutions of large systems of linear and nonlinear equations, (2) iterative solutions of ill-posed problems, (3) solutions of inverse problems, (4) large-scale eigenvalue and singular value problems, structured problems in linear algebra, and (5) mathematics for liquid crystal, and applications to biology. The conference topics center around the recent developments of tools in numerical analysis and scientific computing. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, there have been new and important developments in the field of numerical analysis and scientific computing. Advances in the design of new computational algorithms and their theoretical analysis and applications to different branches of sciences, have generated many new frontiers in this field. An important tool, inherent in most numerical solution approaches, is the use of iterative methods. Any breakthrough in the algorithm and theory of iterative methods will have a huge impact on solving many important problems in different disciplines. On the other hand, the applications from different fields provide a great platform for the advance of algorithmic designs and analytical theories of iterative methods. The PI proposes to organize a conference to address the fast development in these frontiers. The focus of this conference includes: fast iterative solutions of large systems of linear and nonlinear equations, iterative solutions of ill-posed problems, solutions of inverse problems, large-scale eigenvalue and singular value problems, structured problems in linear algebra, orthogonal polynomials, quadratures, mathematics for liquid crystal, and applications to biology. This conference covers computational subjects which are crucial for solving complicated problems in a wide range of scientific, engineering, industrial, and economic disciplines, with applications in areas such as medical and biological image processing, cancer diagnosis, liquid crystal display, mobile tablet, information technology, aircraft design, radar technology, petroleum and natural gas reservoir, and natural disaster prediction, etc.",
