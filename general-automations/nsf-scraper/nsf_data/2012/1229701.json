 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the development of an open-source, dual-probe atomic force microscope (AFM).  The AFM is one of the most versatile tools for nanoscience and nanotechnology with the ability to perform a wide variety of manipulation and measurement tasks.  Current state-of-the-art AFMs use one probe, requiring the user to switch between manipulation and measurement modes.  The dual-probe AFM will exploit the unique geometry of newly developed probes to place two probe tips head-to-head.  Each probe and the substrate will be independently actuated creating unprecedented functionality through simultaneous, localized manipulation and measurement.  In manipulation tasks (push, pull, cut, pick, position, orient, assemble, twist, etc), one probe will manipulate while the other probe is imaging.  A feedback loop will create high-speed, automated manipulation.  In lithography tasks (scratch, dynamic plow, oxidation, dip-pen, etc), a similar arrangement will create precision lithography through real-time process regulation and control.  In material characterization tasks, the sample will be mechanically, electrically, magnetically, or thermally excited by one probe and measured by the other creating spatially and temporally resolved material measurements under localized excitation.  The open-source architecture of the developed instrument will also serve as a unique experimental platform for advanced control systems research.\r\n\r\nThe instrument to be developed has the potential for broad impact in a wide range of research and research training activities.  The Missouri S&T Materials Research Center (MRC) will make the instrument available to external users.  In addition to materials-related experimentation, the instrument will also be available for control-systems research.  Modular code will be provided on the MRC webpage which can be modified and submitted for remote testing.  Missouri S&T and the MRC are committed to long-term maintenance and upkeep of this instrument.  The instrument will also be used in a variety of educational activities including undergraduate and graduate courses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe aim of this Major Research Instrumentation project was to develop a dual-probe atomic force microscope (AFM) with a flexible and open physical and software architecture.  The AFM is one of the most versatile tools for nanoscience and nanotechnology with the ability to perform a wide variety of manipulation and measurement tasks.  The dual-probe AFM exploits the unique geometry of certain newly developed probes in order to place two probe tips head-to-head for coordinated operation in the same workspace.  Each probe and the substrate are independently actuated creating unprecedented functionality through simultaneous, localized manipulation and measurement.  Measurement noise on each probe is below 1nm.  The real-time control system allows for software reconfiguration of the feedback loops to operate in a variety of coordinated, automated, and manual modes.  Manual control mode is operated directly by the user through a haptic interface.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe developed instrument is currently being used in a variety of research activities in automated nano-manipulation, precision tip-based nano-lithography, and spatially and temporally resolved material measurement under localized excitation.  The instrument has provided new understanding of multi-harmonic dynamics in tapping mode atomic force microscopy.  It has also inspired a new class of quasiperiodic signals relevant to raster imaging.  A new type of Repetitive Controller has been created based on the internal model principle for the class of quasiperiodic signals, yielding better imaging resolution at faster scan rates.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nSeven graduate students and two undergraduate students participated in a collaborative environment involving faculty and research scientists from mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, materials science, and chemistry to develop the dual-probe AFM.  In addition to providing a unique research platform, the dual-probe AFM also replaces a 20 year old AFM in the Missouri S&amp;T Materials Research Center, which was used regularly for nanoscale metrology in a variety of applications for Missouri S&amp;T researchers and regional businesses.  The dual-probe AFM is also featured in a new demonstration that was prepared for high school students.  In the demonstration, students use the haptic interface on the dual-probe AFM to feel the nanoscale texture and attractive/repulsive forces of various samples.  The demonstration is presented annually at the Missouri S&amp;T Jackling Institute, a summer camp for junior and senior level high school students interested in engineering.  The instrument and data generated by the instrument are also used in a variety of undergraduate and graduate control systems and signal processing courses at Missouri S&amp;T.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/25/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas A Bristow"
