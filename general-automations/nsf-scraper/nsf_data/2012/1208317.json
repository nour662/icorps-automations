 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant enables the PIs to continue and expand their research program on the formation, dynamics, and applications of ultracold molecules at sub-miliKelvin temperatues. Prior research by the group has focused on diatomic alkali molecules produced by the process of ultracold photoassociation, in which pairs of ultracold alkali metal atoms are associated into bound vibrational levels of electronically excited molecular states. These electronically excited molecules then decay by spontaneous emission of light, some to near-dissociation rovibrational levels of the singlet ground state (the X state) or the metastable triplet state (the a state). New experiments will focus on methods to efficiently create KRb and Rb2 molecules in the lowest rovibrational levels of both the stable X state, X(v=0, J=0), and the metastable a(0,0) state. The program also includes related studies of radiative lifetimes and collisions.\r\n\r\nTwo promising methods for continuous and simple production of X(0,0) are: (1) resonance-enhanced coupling of two different electronic states, one with long-range character to enhance photoassociation and the other with short-range character to enhance decay to X(0,0); (2) Feshbach-Optimized Photoassociation (FOPA) in a magnetic field to greatly enhance photoassociation rates by mixing of high levels of the X and a states, again to enhance the short-range character of the wave function. For the metastable a(0,0) state, a novel \"blue-detuned\" photoassociation scheme can produce large populations, and is being used to study the purely radiative lifetime at low density as well as inelastic and reactive collisions in an optical trap.\r\n\r\nBy trapping ultracold molecules at high densities, the group seeks to observe for the first time ultracold atom-molecule photoassociation. This will produce ultracold triatomic molecules such as Rb3 and KRb2 in previously unexplored excited states, which can be detected either by laser ionization or autoionization.\r\n\r\nInterest in X(0,0) molecules is particularly strong because only in this quantum state can it be assured that collisions will not cause heating due to changes in the internal quantum state. This enables long trapping times and investigations of subtle quantum interactions. Possible applications of cold polar molecules for quantum information are of great current interest, and at high enough densities even a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate becomes a possibility. The new production methods explored in this project offer large advantages in simplicity over alternative approaches such as Raman transfer in quantum degenerate gases, and they enable continuous or near-continuous generation of cold molecules. Systematic studies of the spectroscopy and dynamics of these cold molecules will provide much-needed data and physical insights to inform future investigations of both ultracold and room-temperature molecules.\r\n\r\nThe project will be well-integrated into the large ultracold physics program at the University of Connecticut, currently including seven faculty and about 40 students and postdoctoral fellows. Elements of this integration include project-based group meetings, mentoring, workshops, seminars, and numerous national and international collaborations. Presentations by our research group members locally and at meetings and other educational institutions contribute to scientific understanding. Broader long term benefits include new understanding and applications in areas such as ultracold chemistry, measurements of fundamental symmetries and physical constants, quantum information science, and nanoscience, as well as improved international collaboration.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNeutral atoms and molecules exhibit extremely quantum mechanical behavior at low temperatures such as the microKelvin temperatures we work at, close to absolute zero.  It has long been known that He atoms form a superfluid flow [without resistance] even at much higher temperatures.  Much more recently have atomic species other than He been found to be superfluid. A major difference from electrical currents is that neutral atom flow does not move charges while electron flow does.  Work is now beginning to develop \"atomtronic\" circuits and devices which are based on such atomic flow.  See e.g. Gretchen Campbell, \"Things you can do with a loop of cold atoms\", Physics 9, 127 (2016). However, atoms have many states depending on the behavior of their electrons, and usually only the lowest energy state is associated with superfluidity, although excited metastable [long-lived] states of He, for example, are also of high interest.\n\nMolecules are more complex, with vibrational and rotational motion of the nuclei, in addition to electronic degrees of freedom.  Neutral two atom [diatomic] molecules correspond to the simplest extension from neutral atoms and are what we study in our lab.  We  have chosen two specific molecules, Rb2 and KRb, for a variety of experimental and theoretical reasons, Rb2 being homonuclear and KRb heteronuclear.  In studying such ultracold molecules, we make them from atoms at ultracold temperatures [below 0.001 K].  Fortunately we now understand quite well the process of photoassociation in which an ultracold gas of K and Rb atoms, for example, is irradiated with a laser to produce a specific excited rovibronic [rotational-vibrational-electronic] quantum state of the KRb molecule, which then spontaneously emits a photon as it decays into different rovibronic quantum states of lower energy, such as the lowest energy state in the molecule, which is labelled X(0,0) for the lowest electronic state X, the lowest vibrational state v = 0, and the lowest rotational state J = 0.  Such lowest states are particularly desirable \"target states\", if one wants to make superfluid molecules.  In addition, even X(0,0) states are not the last word in some molecules such as KRb and Rb2 because of so-called hyperfine effects associated with the magnetic moments of the nuclei and the electrons in the molecules, but for simplicity we will not discuss these complications here.  It is nevertheless true that this is the ultimate level of complexity for the simplest molecules and theoretical physics provides a very detailed and precise understanding.\n\nOur initial goal was simply to produce X(0,0) states.  We then realized that the lowest excited state of KRb and of Rb2 was the metastable a state and thus a(0,0) became a second important target state which we believe we can produce in both KRb and Rb2 with ~40% efficiency. \n\nThere is also another process called magnetoassociation which can sometimes even more efficiently produce the highest excited vibrational levels of the a state, such as a(vmax, J), where vmax is the highest vibrational energy level of the a state and J is usually 0 or 1.\n\nOther target states came to mind as we proceeded.  For example, if we can find mixed [\"resonantly coupled\"] states with which we can convert a(vmax, J= 0, 1 or 2) into X(0,0) using two tunable lasers and find mixed states to convert two colliding atoms into X(0,0) or a(0,0), again using two tunable lasers.\n\nFinally, we noted that an important property of many maximum v vibrational states is that most of the time during their vibrational period is spent at the largest distance compatible with their energy.  That is, that such levels were \"long-range molecules\" with the average distance between the two nuclei often orders of magnitude larger than an ordinary chemical bond distance.  Starting with such molecules, we could study a completely new kind of electronic state which occurs only at very large distances, long range Rydberg states (including so-called trilobite or butterfly states, due to the complex shape of their wavefunctions).  One way of thinking about these states is to first think about an atomic Rydberg state, the electronic state of an atom where the electron is highly excited in its principal quantum number n, so the electronic is much more weakly bound and hence has a much larger orbit than a ground state atom.  Then for example in Rb2, a ground state 5S Rb atom can easily fit inside a 7P Rb atom.  There is then an attractive force between the ground state Rb atom and both the Rydberg electron and the Rb+ core of the Rydberg atom, leading to a novel long range potential well we have studied using long range molecule levels of the a state of Rb2.\n\nThus we have published studies of a variety of these target states.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William C Stwalley"
