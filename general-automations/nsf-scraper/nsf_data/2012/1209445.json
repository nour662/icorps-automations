 "awd_abstract_narration": "1209445\r\nBelmont\r\n\r\nThere is a pressing need to identify which elements of the coupled natural-human system are most sensitive to changes in land use and climate in the sense that they are likely to respond strongly to changes in these factors. Means of identifying such ?hot spots? of sensitivity to change would allow us to target remediation and other management measures where they will do the most good. This project will test and explore the ecologic and management implications of a novel hypothesis termed human-amplified natural change (HANC), which states that the areas of the landscape that are most susceptible to human, climatic, and other external changes are those undergoing the highest natural rates of change.\r\n\r\nThe research team will develop a theoretical framework for vulnerability assessment and will test the HANC hypothesis through intensive study of the Minnesota River Basin (MRB), a 44,000 km2 agriculturally-dominated watershed in the upper Midwest. The MRB encompasses an extremely broad spectrum of natural and human-induced rates of change and sensitivity to land-use practices. Of particular interest is the complex nonlinear coupling between land use and river network processes, which has already resulted in severely impaired waters for sediment and nutrients. What will be the future condition of the waters and ecosystem services in the MRB under changing human actions and climatic conditions? Of the many potential land and water management options, which are most likely to produce a sustainable, resilient, and thriving coupled economic-environmental system?  To answer such questions, this study seeks to:\r\n\r\n(1) determine the extent to which current high rates of sediment production are concentrated in areas that were undergoing high rates of natural change before the external changes were imposed; \r\n(2) study how thresholds and localized features in the system amplify and accelerate change and how such nonlinear effects can be parameterized in an integrated predictive modeling framework; \r\n(3) investigate the extent to which the human-amplified natural changes (HANC) in the geomorphic system contribute to observed ecological changes in the MRB; and \r\n(4) develop means to include HANC-based reasoning in decision analysis frameworks, including a suite of methods to identify sensitive regions, along with spatially targeted monitoring activities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Strong relationships previously developed with State regulatory agencies will ensure that the results from this project directly influence future land and water policy and management decisions.  The research team will disseminate new knowledge directly to the public in close collaboration with State agencies via stakeholder meetings, widely attended regional meetings and informational reports. Further, they will develop a HANC-based analytical toolbox for evaluating areas prone to rapid change in the landscape, beginning with Midwestern agricultural landscapes. New knowledge generated from this work will be used to inform Science Museum exhibits related to the Anthropocene, develop innovative K-12 curricula in environmental science and engineering, and disseminate NSF?s Earth Science and Climate Literacy Principles via teacher training.  The project supports three early-career PIs and training of graduate, undergraduate, and ?synthesis-postdoctoral? students in an interdisciplinary environment, co-advised by scientists in hydrology, geomorphology, ecology, biology, engineering, and economics.",

While our NSF funding for this project ended in September, 2017, the broader collaborative project continues through Fall 2018. We remain actively engaged in the broader project and refer readers to the Outcomes Report of the broader REACH project. For context, our funding represents approximately 10% of the overall $4.3M REACH award.</p>\n<p>We developed a wide variety of innovative analytical and modeling tools, several novel datasets, and published a total of 17 peer-reviewed journal publications, with four publications currently in review. All papers are either published in open-access journals or are freely accessible to the general public via email request to patrick.belmont@usu.edu.

The paper discusses our interactions with Minnesota state agencies and documents the facts that water quality regulations have been modified and the strategy for sediment reduction in the Minnesota River Basin has been substantially altered as a result of our work. Our research discoveries and communication efforts are actively influencing policy and management, as has been documented a multitude of times throughout the project, and most recently on the <a href=\"https://www.pca.state.mn.us/featured/prescription-le-sueur-river-hold-water\">Minnesota Pollution Control Agency website</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/wq-swm1-03.pdf\">recent report</a> (see links below if hyperlinks are not active on research.gov) on the Minnesota River Basin.

We have succeeded on all three of those fronts. Novel datasets include:</p>\n<p>1) highly resolved structure-from-motion photogrammetry surveys (7 surveys on each of two bluffs over two and a half years) for measuring cm resolution bluff erosion, distributed through our research groups box.com site.</p>\n<p>2) 12,000 daily timelapse photos of 18 different bluffs, documenting fluvial scour and mass wasting over time,&nbsp;distributed through our research groups box.com site.</p>\n<p>3) over 220 km of bathymetry measured on the mainstem Minnesota River, post-processed and distributed through Hydroshare.</p>\n<p>4) over 200 sediment fingerprinting samples (Beryllium-10, Lead-210, Cesium-137) distributed via appendix files in publications.</p>\n<p>5) 47 cross sections measured on the Le Sueur and Maple rivers before and after a 100 year flood, distributed via an appendix file associated with Call et al., 2017.</p>\n<p>Many of these novel datasets are highlighted in videos created for public dissemination via youtube. Videos range from formal talks given at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXqX9VgdLm4&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Agricultural Drainage and Future of Water Quality workshop</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-xbZsbRtHM\">Southern Minnesota Ravine Workshop</a>, to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj0kSdQ875k&amp;feature=youtu.be\">timelapse photography demonstrating bluff erosion over two years</a>, to real-time video capturing a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b9C6pT5bHc\">massive bluff failure</a>&nbsp;(600+ views!).</p>\n<p>Many of our publications developed analytical tools, the scripts for which we have released publicly on our website or as an appendix file associated with the publication. For example, Schaffrath et al., 2015 developed scripts for&nbsp;batch processing of large lidar datasets for Geomorphic Change Detection. Stout and Belmont, 2014 developed the TerEx Tool to map floodplain and terrace surfaces.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we have enhanced the capacity of the research community via development of numerous modeling tools.

Along similar lines, the Czuba et al., 2017 model is the first model to track parcels of sediment during transport through the channel network in order to identify sediment transport bottlenecks and morphodynamic hotspots. Lastly, the Call et al., 2017 model is the first model to predict changes in floodplain inundation in river systems that are experiencing systematically changing flood regimes. Call et al., 2017 is the first to highlight the importance of channel adjustment capacity in predicting changes in flood risk over time and was highlighted in the EOS AGU Spotlight in recognition of the novelty of its contribution.</p>\n<p>Lastly, REACH provided support for two post-doctoral researchers, two PhD, four MS, and six undergraduate students.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/26/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Patrick&nbsp;Belmont</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1209445/1209445_10202041_1516991434160_REACHconceptualmodel--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1209445/1209445_10202041_1516991434160_REACHconceptualmodel--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REACH conceptual model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1209445/1209445_10202041_1516991434160_REACHconceptualmodel--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REACH conceptual model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This conceptual model depicts the general components and interactions considered in broader REACH modeling framework.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Patrick Belmont</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Patrick&nbsp;Belmont</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REACH conceptual model</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1209445/1209445_10202041_1516990895869_bathymetry_mankato--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1209445/1209445_10202041_1516990895869_bathymetry_mankato--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"bathymetry_mankato_mn\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1209445/1209445_10202041_1516990895869_bathymetry_mankato--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"bathymetry_mankato_mn\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">We mapped bathymetry of more than 220 km of the Minnesota River.
