 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project will explore how high school students learn engineering design by investigating these students' misconceptions about engineering design.  The investigators will use a longitudinal study of high school students in three states who engage in engineering design experiences.  The analysis techniques to be employed are well-grounded in current theories.  Comparisons with college students will provide insights on how students develop design competencies.   \r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be to guide existing projects and efforts that introduce elements of engineering and design into the K-12 curriculum, particularly at the high school level.  As design becomes increasingly important in university engineering programs, an increased understanding of high school student's design experiences is need to help them transition from secondary school to college.  The project will broadly disseminate findings among the engineering education and cognitive science communities so that the research can impact practice.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.",

This approach to protocol analysis is applicable across any process-based view of designing and generates results based on a common comparative measure independent of the design task.\n\nResearch Design\n\nThe fundamental research question addressed through this study was: What are the measurable cognitive differences in designing between high school students and undergraduate engineering students? The research design studied two variables, design experience and maturity, where experience is formal pre-engineering coursework and maturity was the time between data collected during the fall of both junior and senior years of high school. Two groups of participants, those with and those without formal pre-engineering course experience, were drawn from samples of high school juniors attending several rural mid-Atlantic high schools all offering the same 9th &ndash; 12th grade pre-engineering course sequence.

The design sessions were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed following the FBS verbal protocol.\n\nResults\n\nComparing cognitive effort between undergraduate engineering students with high school experiment and control groups on the six design issues revealed there were significant differences in function Year 1, and in expected behavior and the problem-solution (P-S) index in Year 2. Similarly for the eight syntactic design processes, Year 1 comparisons revealed differences on synthesis, analysis, reformulation II, and the P-S index, and Year 2 on evaluation, which did not occur in the first year.

Typical of such novice designers, the high school participants devoted the largest amount of their cognitive effort on structure.\n\nDiscussion\n\nFinding significant differences in cognitive effort between undergraduate engineering students and high school student groups was anticipated given there are substantial program differences. However, finding there were no significant differences in design issues or processes between high school students with and without pre-engineering coursework was an unanticipated result.
