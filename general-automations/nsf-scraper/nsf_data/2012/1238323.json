 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed planning activity seeks to undertake planning of the establishment of a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) site at Georgetown University of the existing Security and Software Engineering Research I/UCRC. The center is currently comprised of Ball State University, Iowa State University, Virginia Tech, and industry and government partners in the field. The Georgetown University site intends to bring capabilities in real-time network security, security policy, and governance to the center. Initial research projects are anticipated to be in areas such as secure network interoperability; tailored trusted spaces for secure communications; social, behavioral, and economic impediments to inter-enterprise communication; and the social impact of inter-enterprise communication.\r\n\r\nThe planned site, in combination with the existing center plans to help build innovation capacity in security and software engineering through its work in network security and the inclusion of governance and policy in the security software engineering process.  The outcomes from the center have the potential to broadly impact the public and private sectors through realization of more readily acceptable and usable security systems and technology.  The site plans to have a significant impact on students through integration of center research concepts into the curriculum. Graduate students from the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, as well as law, business, government, and policy, are planned to be involved in the work, thus touching a demographic not typical of computer science and engineering.\r\n",
