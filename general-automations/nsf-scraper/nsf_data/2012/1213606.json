Specifically, Prof. Trawick and his colleagues will develop methods to correct for time-dependent drift due to electrostatic charging and adsorption of material to the scanning tip, as well as for slow, in-plane positional drift.\r\n\r\nScanning microscopy tools and methods are becoming workhorse instruments in laboratories working in a variety of areas.  Like most other microscopy methods, there are instrumental artefacts that degrade performance, especially related to ultimate instrumental resolution.  Professor Trawick and his undergraduate research students are developing new software tools, which will be broadly disseminated to the research community to help correct for some of the most common imaging artefacts.  The undergraduate students being trained in Professor Trawick's laboratory will obtain hands-on experience in cutting-edge experimental and computational research, helping them to become productive members of the technological workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) is an advanced technique that allows researchers to image various kinds of physical, chemical, and biological samples at a resolution of better than a single nanometer, or one billionth of a meter.  SPM works by physically scanning a very sharp probe, or \"tip\", back and forth over a sample surface&mdash;like mowing a lawn, but collecting data at every point along the way to produce a final image of the area covered.  Different kinds of SPM can produce either topographical images of a sample, or images based on other properties of the surface, such as variations in hardness, chemical composition, or optical properties.  SPM is widely used in science and industry for measuring the properties of new materials, different kinds of cells and tissues, and even tiny manufactured devices.\n\nWhile Scanning Probe Microscopy is often able to detect nanometer-scale features on a sample, precise measurements of those features, especially over a wider surface, can be more difficult. The engineering challenges associated with positioning the tip relative to a surface with better than nanometer precision are fundamentally daunting.  The piezoelectric materials that are responsible for moving the tip do not respond instantaneously to their inputs, so that the tip's actual position often lags behind where it should be.  Tiny contaminants on the surface, or even water adsorbed from the environment, can adhere to the tip as it moves, rapidly changing its interactions with the sample surface over time.  Even minute changes in the temperature of the sample enclosure can cause different materials in the sample and the microscope to expand or contract at different rates over time.  All of these tiny changes can lead to imperfections, or \"artifacts,\" in a final image, even in the most advanced SPM instruments.  While gradual changes can cause an image to be distorted, as if a painter's canvas were stretched or deformed, more rapid changes lead to artifacts such as streaks or bands in an image&mdash;as if the cutting height of a lawn mower were randomly adjusted up or down after every few rows.  All of these artifacts make it harder to use the images for accurate measurements, especially for very small features on the scale of single molecules, and especially for comparing measurements over longer distances.\n\nThis project has developed a new method for correcting these different kinds of imaging artifacts, allowing researchers in science and industry to use SPM for precise measurements of sample features on even the tiniest scale of single molecules.  In essence, the method developed is analagous to passing the lawn mower back over a small portion of the same area a second time, producing a second image.  If the first pass was made mowing from east to west, the second pass is made mowing from north to south over a narrow, vertical sliver from the center of the original area.  The data from the two resulting images is compared using a set of sophisticated mathematical computer algorithms.  These algorithms perform billions of calculations to reconstruct the precise combination of slowly changing errors in the lawn mower's position and rapid changes in the lawn mower's cutting height that must have caused the observed differences between the two images.  Once that combination is determined, that same precise combination is mathematically applied in reverse to the data of the original image, yielding a single reconstructed image of the full area as it would have been seen under ideal conditions.\n\nThe major tangible outcome of this project is the actual computer software that was developed for correcting SPM images.  Due to the complexity of the calculations required, a significant degree of optimization was needed in order to develop code that was fast and efficient enough to easily run on a standard desktop computer.  The computer code for the software has been placed online, where it will remain freely accessible to other researchers, and can be further improved and adapted by other programmers into the future. \n\nMuch of the work on this project was performed by undergraduate students under the mentorship of the principal investigator, and was a valuable experience in their training as future scientists and researchers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew L Trawick"
