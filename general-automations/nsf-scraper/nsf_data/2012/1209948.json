The host scientist is Dr. Yamamura Issei.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is improve visualization tools for the study of stellar ejecta, critical to understanding the evolution and circulation of matter in the Universe as a whole. Understanding stellar mass loss is synonymous with understanding the primary means to distribute matter synthesized in stars into the surrounding space as the seed for the following generations of stars, planets, and, ultimately, life.  The research focuses on generating the cleanest maps of circumstellar dust shells by using interactive software named FAST (Far-infrared surveyor AKARI Slow-scan Tools) to optimize the images generated when data are reduced using a process known as AKARI MLHES (excavating Mass Loss History in Extended dust shells of Evolved Stars).  This procedure optimizes the observational characterization of the history of stellar mass loss.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.
