The meeting is unique in that it brings together scientists doing basic research involving chromosome behavior in two yeast models, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.  The meeting covers a wide range of topics, including:  DNA replication, chromosome structure and evolution, chromatin structure and gene expression, telomeres and silencing, recombination and chromosome rearrangements, mitosis and meiosis, cell cycle regulation, kintechores, spindles and cytokinesis.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nAttention has been paid to recruiting a diverse group of speakers, including both senior and early-career investigators.  Support will be provided as scholarships to students and postdoctoral fellows chosen based on need; scholarships will be limited to one per research lab, to ensure broad use of the funds.  Priority will be given to underrepresented minorities.",

The topics covered in the meeting include DNA replication, DNA repair, recombination, chromosome stability, mitotic and meiotic spindle structure, cell cycle control and telomere biology. There were 32 invited speakers (3 or 4 in each of the eight sessions). There were also 2 to 4 shorter talks in each session that were chosen from submitted abstracts.

Question and answer sessions after talks were quite lively and involved a large fraction of the attendees.

There were four poster sessions in which ~100 posters were presented.
