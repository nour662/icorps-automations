It will invite speakers to lecture and graduate students to participate in the sessions designed to improve researchers and educators handling of data. It will illustrate how it can enhance the researchers' research and the classroom curriculum.  The workshop is entitled \"Navigating Earth System Science Data.\"  The main goals of the workshop are a) raise awareness of \"Data Science\" in the geoscience academic community; and b) share hands-on activities, course materials, and ideas for improving research and education.  This will be done through a series of plenary presentations, hands-on lab sessions, poster sessions, and panel discussions.",
