 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mid-ocean ridge system is the largest feature on the surface of the Earth. It is also the site of much active faulting, and of most of the Earth's volcanic activity. The production of new seafloor by the process of seafloor spreading is a fundamental process that shapes the planet's surface. A half-century's research has revealed much about the mid-ocean ridge system, and an increasingly important tool for understanding the workings of mid-ocean ridges is numerical modeling. Though the ridge system is three dimensional, such models have, up to now, been limited to two dimensions owing to computing limitations. This project represents an ambitious collaborative effort to build the first genuinely 3D models of faulting and magmatism (volcanic processes) over a global range of mid-ocean ridge settings. This project has a variety of broader impacts. The results of this study and the development of a new 3D visco-elasticplastic tectonics code will benefit studies of long-term lithospheric deformation generally, with broad applications in Earth (e.g., GeoPRISMS and Earthscope programs) as well as planetary science. In addition, 3D time-dependent visualizations will make exceptionally stimulating and intuitive illustrations for use in ongoing classroom instructional and K-12 outreach activities. Most of the budget will support two talented and promising graduate students. Finally, the PIs will work with the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG) to document, benchmark, and disseminate both our 2D and 3D codes, thereby contributing the the scientific infrastructure.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe sluggish but perpetual motion of the Earth?s tectonic plates creates massive fault zones associated with essentially all of the world?s earthquakes and most of its volcanic activity.  In the mid ocean, an extensive network of ridges and valleys mark the centers where the plates are spreading apart and where new seafloor is being created. In this collaborative study between researchers and Ph.D. students at the University of Hawaii and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, we have studied how magmatism and faulting interact at these seafloor spreading centers, and thus shape the structure of the oceanic crust.  In one study, argued that the corrugated surface of the seafloor is formed by the interaction of faulting and magmatism at seafloor spreading centers, arguing against a newly posed hypothesis that changes in climate caused fluctuating magmatic construction and the formation of these corrugations.  Our analyses of a spreading center offshore of Chile have revealed that even though the system is heavily faulted, 85-95% of the plate motion is fed by magmatism.  Evidence shows that prominent variations in the size of faults are influenced the geometry of the spreading center as well as by variations in the flux of magma rising up from the deep Earth below.  For another study, we developed a computational code to simulate faulting and magmatism in tectonic plates.  We found that approximations that have been used in prior studies can lead to unrealistic predictions, and we recommended the appropriate mechanical properties that should be used for more accurate representations of these systems.  In yet another study, we used high-performance computing to simulate seafloor spreading in three-dimensions.  We characterized how the pattern of faulting can respond to spatial variations in the rate of magmatism, and we showed that fault structure is impacted by stresses transmitted long distances both along and across the spreading center.  Our models predicted that oceanic detachment faults&mdash;among the largest faults in the mid oceans&mdash;tend to form when only about 50% of plate motion is fed by magmatism.  Increased magmatism on the sides of these detachment faults, can break them up and thus impose an ultimate limit on their sizes.  Overall, the insight we have gained about seafloor spreading centers promotes a better understanding of faulting and magmatism on land, which can impact large populations in the U.S. and around the world. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/15/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Garrett T Apuzen-Ito"
