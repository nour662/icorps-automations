 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emory University doctoral candidate Tawni L. Tidwell, supervised by Dr. Carol M. Worthman, will investigate biocultural understandings of how humans create and teach complex knowledge systems. The focus of the research will be on how medical knowledge and epistemologies are conceptualized, transmitted, and then enacted in practical skill.  Using Tibetan medicine as a case study, she will examine how diagnosis is formally transmitted, cultivated, and clinically deployed, in this 2,000 year-old  text-based, orally-instructed, and practically-implemented non-Western system. What are the learning processes and related sociocultural structure that support such a system in its enactment of diagnostic skill? What do these processes tell us about the transmission of complex knowledge systems more generally?\r\n\r\nAs the first western student in Men-Tsee-Khang, the premier Tibetan medical school, Tidwell will undertake her investigation with Tibetan medical student peers, faculty, and a group of expert physicians. She will document how diagnostic skills are transmitted, cultivated and applied, with particular regard to a Tibetan medical illness category called dres-nad.  The focus on dres-nad is strategic because dres-nads and biomedical cancers are the illness categories in which the Tibetan medical and western biomedical systems most closely overlap.  As such, this overlap opens a space in which to elucidate the distinctive features of the two systems of diagnosis and care.  Through class participant-observation, student and faculty interviews, and expert physician clinical observations, Tidwell will look at these processes, influences and methods of how situated knowledge of the body interacts with knowledge practice systems to develop skill development and further such skills toward expertise with specific regard to dres-nad. \r\n\r\nThis research will provide insight into the transmission of complex systems of knowledge by illuminating medical education in a sophisticated, rigorous and systematic non-Western medical system. The study will facilitate international research collaborations and partnerships. Funding this research also supports the education of a graduate student.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n  In terms of intellectual merit, this project contributes to two areas in anthropology theory and practice: \n\n1.  Explication of cultural knowledge transmission processes of a tradition focused on effective transmission of practiced skills, and \n2.  Biocultural understandings of how humans create and teach complex knowledge systems around health and well-being.  \n\nI. Cultural knowledge transmission\n\n  With respect to how cultural knowledge is transmitted, particularly, knowledge of practice, or technologies, Tibetan physicians describe their tradition as a textually-based, orally-instructed, practically-implemented knowledge transmission system that extends at least 2,000 years.  The principal investigator was fully immersed in the traditional education system for thirty-six months, completing the full four-year curriculum of Tibetan medicine during this time, and becoming the first Westerner to do so. The first half of the study was conducted at the premier Tibetan medical education institute outside of Tibet &ndash; Men-Tsee-Khang &ndash; and the second half in eastern Tibet in the capital city, Xining, Qinghai Province of the People\u00c6s Republic of China at the Tibetan Medical College of Qinghai University.  The shift to Xining allowed her to observe differences inside and outside Tibet of how Tibetan medical pedagogy, cultural transmission processes, transmission of practiced skills, and bicultural understandings of how a similar ethnic and cultural population create and teach a complex knowledge system around health and well-being.  \n\n  Many among the Tibetan community assume that an exile context allows for better cultural preservation.  However, this study evaluated this presumption first-hand, gathering much evidence to the contrary.  The transfer provided significant and unexpected insights into how the respective classroom, clinical and field pedagogies differ inside and outside Tibet, as well as differences in how texts and classroom instructions transfer to practical skill in the clinical context.  The social, economic, and cultural structures that support the system at Men-Tsee-Khang and the system in Xining have provided greater differences in the transmission processes and values than expected.  The former has focused on textual proficiency and the latter on efficacy of practical skill.  \n\nII. Biocultural understandings of health knowledge systems\n\n With respect to biocultural understandings of how humans create and teach complex knowledge systems around health and well-being, the intermingling of biomedical and Western scientific perspectives with the Tibetan medical textual instruction has provided for rich comparisons of how Tibetan medical physician instructors understand how their knowledge system dialogues with that of biomedicine and Western science.  The initial slippage of one-to-one translation terms like tren for tumor and \u00e6dres-nad for cancer, is later complicated by an explication of the Tibetan medical etiological understanding underlying tren and \u00e6dres-nad compared to that of the biomedical designations of tumor and cancer.  In a sense, there is an assumption by Tibetan physicians that biomedicine and Tibetan medicine should arrive at similar disease categories given that the body and what ails it is identical.  That is, a patient who gets diagnosed and treated in a biomedical hospital compared to a Tibetan medical hospital carries with him or her the same mind-body complex and descriptions of their ailments and distresses.\n\n  However, the textual bases describing the etiology for tren and \u00e6dres-nad differ significantly from that which Western medicine describes for tumors and cancer.  The study has explicated and is in the process of publishing these differences in both English and Tibetan as to provide greater clarification in how each system approaches the class of conditions understood as tren, \u00c6dres-nad, tumors and cancers.\n\n Both Men-Tsee-Khang and Xining claim cultural knowledge preservatio..."
