 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for research enabling the development of a fully three-dimensional multiphysics phase-field model and related experimentation for understanding of the electrohydrodynamic process of needleless electrospinning. Needleless electrospinning, based on free liquid-surface jetting, is a novel low-cost, top-down nanomanufacturing technique capable of continuous, scalable production of nanofibers of natural and synthetic polymers and polymer-derived carbon, ceramics, semiconductors, metals, metal oxides, etc. for broad applications in filtration, biomedical engineering, energy conversion and storage, nanocomposites, and so on. The developed computational model formulates a generalized free energy of an electrospinning system that is capable of uniformly treating the multiphysics, multiphase phenomenon of the process including multi-jet initiation, jet stretching, phase separation, drying, etc. The developed phase-field model can overcome the numerical difficulty in tracking the instantaneous profile of the liquid surface after multi-jetting and pore formation. Efficient semi-implicit spectral algorithm will be used for fast, robust numerical simulation. The model will determine several key parameters used in needleless electrospinning and be validated by controlled experimentation.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results will establish solid theoretical foundation for needleless electrospinning and the predictive computational model will generate a wealth of fundamental knowledge for design, optimization and control of needleless electrospinning and other electrohydrodynamics-related devices (e.g., electrospray) for reliable, efficient, mass production. The results will benefit the computer-aided electrospinning engineering (CAEE) in education, research and industrial applications. The research provides a variety of opportunities for graduates and undergraduates, specially unrepresented minorities including Native American students and female students, to involve in the cutting-edge nanotechnology and computational materials science. The research will be demonstrated to K-12 students and students in the regional Native American tribal colleges. The results will be used for updating the relevant undergraduate and graduate curriculum materials and the development of a new cross-listed course at North Dakota State University.",
