 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on both spring and fall migrations of White-crowned Sparrows.  The primary goal of this research is to determine the physiological mechanisms regulating migratory traits and the environmental signals birds rely upon for preparation and completion of each journey. Although spring and autumn migrations cover the same distance, all other facets of these trips are different and birds have evolved distinct strategies to complete each successfully.  The underlying physiological bases have as yet to be rigorously investigated and the investigator posits that understanding these mechanisms is of growing concern as many migrant populations are declining rapidly owing to marked changes in the environment and loss of habitat. The proposed studies take advantage of two sub-species of White-crowned Sparrow, one that migrates long distances and one that no longer migrates and is resident. The investigator proposes to examine 1) the differences in muscle development and fat storage in the two subspecies as one prepares for spring migration and the other does not; 2) the different hormonal mechanisms involved in the spring and fall migrations, and 3) differences in preparation for the fall migration between young and adult birds. Results from this study may offer new insights into the mechanisms regulating migration while directing further investigations to define the cellular bases that influence the potential success or failure of a migratory population. The project would support a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student and involve several undergraduate assistants. Outreach to the public would occur in California and Alaska through established collaborations between the investigator and the SLEWS (student and landowner education watershed stewardship) program associated with the Audubon Farm and Center for Land-based Learning and the Alaska Bird Observatory, respectively.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMigration is an ancient phenomenon entailing seasonal movements of organisms linking habitats for breeding and overwinter survival. Gambel?s White-crowned sparrow, a long-distance migrant, can cover 12,000 km per year traveling between breeding in the high arctic and overwintering sites in the Southwest US and Mexico. Covering such distances requires physical and behavioral adjustments the extent of which are rarely observed in resident or sedentary species.  To accomplish seasonal movements, migrants rely on environmental cues to accurately schedule travel to arrive at distant ephemeral sites when the local conditions are conducive for breeding in spring and depart from such locations before the onset of winter.  For a migrant wintering at lower latitudes, environmental cues activate behavioral and physiological mechanisms that serve to support long distance flight and arrival for breeding.  Such mechanisms involve the neuroendocrine, endocrine and biochemical systems with the greatest degree of expression observed in migratory species.  For Gambel?s White-crowned sparrow, migration constitutes recurring nocturnal oriented bouts of flight lasting 7 to 10 h covering on average 145 km/day, distances that outstrip the daily routines birds conduct during the nonmigratory seasons.  Such endurance travel necessitate enhanced fuel stores and power as well as heightened processes of the central nervous system.  All of these functions require time to develop &ndash; approximately 1.5 months - and maintain throughout each of the two annual migration stages in spring and autumn. For spring, preparations for migration are initiated with exposure to the annual increase of photoperiod.  Prenuptial molt or replacement of body feathers for improved thermoregulation and breeding represents the first indication that preparations for spring migration are underway. Conclusion of molt is then followed by the neuroendocrine stimulus to overeat (hyperphagia) resulting in increased body weight and deposition of fat or lipid in adipose tissues for storage and flight muscle for energy production.  Lipid is the primary fuel utilized by migratory birds as it is energy dense, light in weight compared to carbohydrate or protein, and does not contribute greatly to body weight, a critical consideration for aerial species. Powered flight is enhanced with increased size of the muscle fibers (hypertrophy) central to muscle contraction promoting flight.  In addition appearance of a novel isoform of the myosin heavy chain protein has been noted suggesting additional support for the efficient contractility of the muscle fibers for endurance flight. \n\n \n\nGonadal steroids also play important roles.  Testosterone in both males and females affects both migratory and subsequent breeding stages.  At the migratory stage, the circulating concentrations of androgens (testosterone and 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone) are well below those of breeding stage; yet, they appear to have biologic activity by regulating the timing and complete expression of preparatory processes including molt, migratory fattening, and migratory restlessness &ndash; the flight behavior observed in captive birds that coincides with migratory period of free living migrants. At the molecular level, androgen promotes remodeling of the flight muscle architecture requisite for long distance flight. All of these changes occur prior to departure for the breeding grounds and highlight the timely development and expression of traits supporting migratory flight. Corticosterone, the major adrenal glucocorticoid in birds, also plays a major role during migration.  Acting as a metabolic hormone, plasma corticosterone increases in response to the energy demands of endurance flight by enhancing mobilization of fuel to working muscles and the brain.\n\n \n\nHistorically, spring and autumn migrations have been considered similar processes given the approximate distances covered are comparable and the behavioral and physiological traits appear similar only the orientation of flight differs as do the environmental conditions.  Our recent tracking data identified different routes followed by spring and autumn migrants.  Additionally, the physiological mechanisms regulating the two seasons differ where gonadal activity plays a major role in the spring but has no effect in autumn.  A conclusion drawn from these results is that each migration is an adaptive solution to enhance breeding in spring and survival in autumn and thus have evolved distinct strategies for successfully completing each journey.  So in summary, spring and autumn migrations though appear to be linked are expressions of two distinct physiological and behavioral states.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marilyn Ramenofsky"
