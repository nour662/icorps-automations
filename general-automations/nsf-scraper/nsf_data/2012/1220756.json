 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have entered the Anthropocene, an age when the actions of seven billion humans have increasing influence on the Earth. The High-Adventure Science: Earth Systems and Sustainability project is developing modules for middle school and high school students in Earth and Space Science classes, testing the hypothesis that students who use computational models, analyze real-world data, and engage in building scientific reasoning and argumentation skills are better able to understand Earth science core ideas and how humans impact Earth's systems. The Concord Consortium in partnership with the University of California Santa Cruz and the National Geographic Society are co-developing these modules, conducting targeted research on how the modules enhance students' higher order thinking skills and understanding of human-Earth interactions, and broadly disseminating these materials via far-reaching education networks.\r\n\r\nThe High-Adventure Science: Earth Systems and Sustainability project is creating online, middle and high school curriculum modules that feature computational models and cover five topics: climate change, fresh water availability, fossil fuel utilization, resource sustainability, and land use management. At the same time, the project team is conducting design studies to look at how specific features, prompts, argumentation and evaluation tools built into the modules affect student understanding of core Earth science concepts. The design studies promote rapid, iterative module development and help to identify features that support student learning, as well as scientific reasoning, scientific argumentation with uncertainty, systems thinking, and model-based experimentation skills. For each module, pre- and posttest data, embedded assessments, student surveys, classroom observations, teacher interviews and surveys, provide important information to rapidly improve module features, content, and usability. The final, high-quality, project materials are being made available to a national audience through the National Geographic Society as well as through the High-Adventure Science: Earth Systems and Sustainability website hosted at the Concord Consortium. \r\n\r\nIt is essential that students graduate from high school with a solid understanding of the scientific concepts that help explain how humans impact Earth systems, and conversely, how Earth processes impact humans. The High-Adventure Science: Earth Systems and Sustainability project provides a unique, research-based approach to conveying to students core Earth science content, crosscutting concepts, and fundamental practices of science. The resulting online curriculum modules and teacher guides provide exciting examples of next generation Earth science teaching and learning materials, and the research findings provide new insights on how students learn core science concepts and gain critical scientific skills.",

Students should explore these systems and how components of the system interact and influence emergent behaviors. One promising way to engage students is to have them consider important unanswered questions that scientists around the world are actively exploring. Students need to be able to explore scientific questions, assess scientific research, draw conclusions and communicate them to others. In learning about human impact on Earth&rsquo;s systems especially, students need opportunities to undertake or evaluate scientific processes, such as making predictions, and consider the variability and uncertainty built into such predictions.</p>\n<p>The High-Adventure Science: Earth&rsquo;s Systems and Sustainability (HAS:ESS) project developed six online curriculum modules for middle and high school Earth and environmental science classes. These modules were designed to bring the excitement of frontier science to the classroom while helping students learn about ongoing research on how humans impact Earth&rsquo;s systems. The modules start with pressing unanswered questions to elicit student thinking. The modules cover freshwater availability, land resource management, air quality, climate change, energy choices, and the search for exoplanets. Five design principles guided the development of each module: 1) use open-ended, authentic frontier science topics to frame the module; 2) engage students in real-world frontier science; 2) have students interpret data collected by scientists; 3) immerse students in experimentation with dynamic computer models depicting complex Earth systems; and 4) support students' evidence-based scientific argumentation while considering sources of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>The project developed two research instruments that measure the practice of scientific argumentation with uncertainty sources and system dynamics thinking. During a three-year data collection period, 132 teachers implemented the modules in the U.S. with approximately 6,300 students. Students significantly improved their scientific argumentation ability after engaging with High-Adventure Science modules. Using students&rsquo; written responses to scientific argumentation tasks embedded in the modules, we developed a taxonomy of uncertainty attribution. This taxonomy is the first such attempt to characterize, define, and name different categories of secondary school students&rsquo; uncertainty attribution responses, into five progressively more sophisticated levels. These levels represent the degree to which students&rsquo; understand the role of uncertainty in science, and the strengths and limitation of the evidence they are using when developing a scientific argument. This taxonomy provides a useful resource for educators and researchers as they bring the authentic practice of real-world scientists into the classroom.</p>\n<p>The project also developed a method to study students&rsquo; system dynamics thinking and to assess their understanding of complex systems. The project divided students understanding of the topic into qualitatively distinguishable levels and validated these distinctions. This framework tracked students&rsquo; uses of stocks and flows when they explained causal mechanisms associated with complex systems.</p>\n<p>The six web-based modules are available at the National Geographic Society website as well as through the High-Adventure Science website hosted at the Concord Consortium. The modules have had a wide appeal. Most recent analytics show that the Concord Consortium High-Adventure Science websites have been visited by 220,000 unique users in 2017, producing a large and growing community of teachers and students (approximately 70,000 registered to use one or more of the modules across all 50 states in the U.S. and several countries).</p>\n<p>For further information, free curricular modules, pre- and post-tests, teacher support materials including answer keys, videos, and links to publications, see https://has.concord.org or <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.org/education/high-adventure-science/\">https://www.nationalgeographic.org/education/high-adventure-science/</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/07/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Amy&nbsp;Pallant</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1220756/1220756_10217966_1518040141735_AirPollutionModel--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1220756/1220756_10217966_1518040141735_AirPollutionModel--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Factors that Affect Air Quality model developed for the &ldquo;Will the air be fresh enough to breathe?&rdquo; module.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1220756/1220756_10217966_1518040141735_AirPollutionModel--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Factors that Affect Air Quality model developed for the &ldquo;Will the air be fresh enough to breathe?&rdquo; module.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Users can explore and discover the connection between weather, geography and air quality.
