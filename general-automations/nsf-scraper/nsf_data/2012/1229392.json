 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT Sankar  1229392\r\nThis proposal is requesting funding for instrumentation suitable for 'large' animal testing and characterization of bio-implant materials. They are specifically considering a HR micro-CT with XRF feature and a multi-photon confocal microscope. These two pieces are used in tandem  to completely image whole bady animal models. The requested capability will enable Micro-surgery in animals, in vivo real-time 3D monitoring and in vivo imaging, for evaluating deep tissue. The implants will be designed to provide optimum therapy when required and to bio-dissolve when no longer needed. Such innovations would particularly benefit pediatric cleft palate patients, angular deformities of long bones, limb length discrepancies, or trauma including fractures that require pins and screws for repair. Other areas of application include osteoporotic fragility fractures in aging baby boomers (wrist, hip and spine) and reconstruction of multiple rib fractures (trauma).",
