 "awd_abstract_narration": "CE) Consortium, composed of ten colleges from Florida, Georgia, and South and North Carolina, whose goals include serving as a leader for cyberforensics education and workforce development in the Southeastern region. The consortium is being established to further cybersecurity broadly. The current project involves the development of distance-delivered, hands-on cyberforensics courses, with core knowledge, skills, and competencies based on multiple sources, including those developed by the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center, NIST, and existing ATE Centers. Each course includes dozens of streaming video lectures -- providing for anytime, anywhere education -- slides, quizzes, and hands-on assignments implemented through virtualization technologies. The courses range from a 2000-level foundational course to several advanced 4000-level courses in operating and file systems, incident response, and network forensics. The courses are being disseminated to interested colleges to address the evolving, converging, and emerging technical workplace and new technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew information technologies that affect consumer and job markets are created on an almost daily basis. The \"unforeseen consequences\" of these new technologies creates an ongoing need for cyberforensics and cybersecurity professionals. As such, it is crucial for new community college graduates to become familiar with these technologies, ethics and related laws, as well as obtain demonstrable hands-on experience with the technologies. This consortium is contacting schools including Seminole State College and Valencia College and is exploring collaborations with additional Navy cybersecurity organizations.",
