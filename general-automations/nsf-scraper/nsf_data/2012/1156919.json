 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of Maryland Eastern Shore that will provide research training for 8 students each year, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2012- 2014.  The program is supported by the Directorate for Biological Science, Division of Biological Infrastructure, the Directorate for Geosciences, Division of Ocean Sciences, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Human Resources HBCU-UP program. The program focuses on marine and estuarine science.  Students are offered a broad range of mentorship in various areas including, but not limited, to fish and macroinvertebrate population dynamics, marine microbiology and parasitology, molecular biology, genetics, marine botany, environmental chemistry, and ecotoxicology. Students, particularly rising sophomores, are recruited by various means, including use of flyers describing the program and by digital-based advertising.  Selection of students is based on academic record, letters of recommendation, and potential for further studies in the areas of marine and environmental science. Students receive a stipend and travel support; housing and board are covered. In addition to research, weekly workshops are conducted to train students in writing a research proposal, analyzing data, scientific ethics, and various contemporary topics such as global climate change. Apart from weekly workshops, REU interns also participate in field trips along the pristine Pocomoke River, and at an internationally recognized wetland on the lower eastern shore of Maryland. At the end of the summer, REU interns present research they have conducted with their faculty mentors during a symposium that is held at the Paul S. Sarbanes Coastal Ecology Center. Interns prepare a short report of their research which is compiled in form of symposium proceedings.  Students are tracked to determine if they have continued to maintain interest in marine and environmental science, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. The program will be assessed using various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. Students with limited opportunities for research, particularly in coastal systems, and from groups under-represented in science are particularly encouraged to apply. Additional information on the REU internship can be found at www.umes.edu/reu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Paulinus Chigbu at: pchigbu@umes.edu), or Co-PI (Dr. Eric May at: ebmay@umes.edu).",
