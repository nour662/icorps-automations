 "awd_abstract_narration": "Policy recommendations often have unintended consequences. This study aims to investigate one such unintended consequence: persistent negative child health impacts of a massive shift in behavior that occurred in Bangladesh around 1999 as millions of households moved away from the use of convenient shallow tube- wells as a source of household drinking water to less convenient deep tube-wells. The shift was in response to concerns that arsenic contamination in shallow tube-wells would increase health risks. However, the associated health risks for young children of switching away from backyard water sources appear to have been sharply underestimated according to preliminary findings by the investigators, which point towards substantial increases in child deaths in households that switch water source.\r\n\r\nThe empirical contribution of this study aims is to disentangle the impact of the behavioral shift from other socioeconomic factors that affect health. The researchers note that at the very local level there is quasi-random variation in arsenic contamination - with some households within the village contaminated and others, very close by, having uncontaminated wells. This analysis can therefore compare child mortality for households within the same village who do or do not have arsenic contamination in their water both before and after 1999, when the behavioral switch took place, and can thus identify the existence of unintended consequences.\r\n  \r\nThe work will contribute to determining the appropriate policy response to arsenic contamination across the world, and will develop methods that can be used to identify unintended consequences of multiple policy recommendations.",

For the most part, the mortality trend in high concentration households closely follows that in low concentration households until 1998-1999, at which point they begin to diverge. Both child and infant mortality rates are substantially higher among individuals in high concentration households relative to those in low concentration households immediately after the arsenic testing campaign (2000-2001), and these differences are sustained to the time of the survey in 2007. However, there is some indication of convergence in the last two two-year intervals. This supports that most switching (and the resulting mortality effects of exposure to microbiologically unsafe water) occurred immediately after the campaign. The convergence suggests that the effects of switching could have been attenuated by increased availability of arsenic-free non-surface water sources (deep tubewells). We use data from 1,093 deep tubewells from 162 villages collected in 2016 to test this hypothesis. Summary statstics can be found in table 1.</p>\n<p>Table 2 summarizes village means adjusted for union fixed effects by village arsenic levels. We define a village to be &ldquo;high concentration&rdquo; if average village arsenic (as measured in the villages&rsquo; shallow tubewells in 2011) is above 50 bbp, as defined as the high contamination cutoff by the WHO. We observe significant differences in the number of deep tubewells per village as well as the number of deep tubewells per 1,000 capita. The difference between low and high concentration villages can also be observed in figure 2, in which we graph the number of existing tubewells per 100 births per year over time. While deep tubewell construction increased overall in 1999, low and high concentration villages diverged in terms of deep tubewells/100 births in 2000, leading to significantly more deep tubewells in high concentration villages as compared to low concentration villages today.</p>\n<p>To verify that higher mortality is due to the switch from shallow tubewells to other water sources and that the convergence in mortality can be explained through increased access to deep tubewell water, we interact the number of deep tubewells/10 births per year with the interaction term of post-campaign exposure and high concentration in table 3. Referring to the full control specification (columns 3,6 and 9), an additional year of exposure to the post-campaign environment for an individual with a contaminated shallow tubewell is associated with a 2.3 percentage point (31%) increase in the likelihood of death within 12 months, a 3.3 percentage point (36%) increase in the likelihood of death within two years, and a 4.1 percentage point (30%) increase in likelihood of death within 5 years. We also find that each additional deep tubewell per 10 births per additional year of exposure is associated with a 1.0 percentage point (14%) decrease in the likelihood of death within 12 months, and a 1.3 percentage point (14%) decrease in the likelihood of death within two years. This result supports our hypothesis that the higher mortality is due to the health costs of switching away from shallow tubewells and that increased access to deep tubewell water explains the convergence in mortality rates. We do not observe a significant effect of the number of deep tubewells on death within five years. This seems reasonable as the number of deep tubewells per birth in each year may be less associated with a decrease in death under five because of the ambiguity of death timing.</p>\n<p>Because shallow tubewells are supplied to individual households (generally built in the backyard close to the residence), they are an extremely convenient water source, which increases the frequency with which water is collected and therefore reduces water storage time and increases water consumption. Storage time is an important determinant of contamination with fecal matter, as water that is not stored properly is continuously exposed to dirty hands and utensils, and previous studies find strong correlations between distance from water source and diarrheal disease (Esrey, 1996). The only water sources equally convenient to shallow tubewells are surface water sources such as ponds that are also likely to be close to the residence. However, these sources are significantly more likely to be contaminated with fecal matter. An increase in the number of deep tubewells per village, however, decreases distances between households and safe water sources and thus increases the frequency with which water is collected, decreases storage times, and decreases the use of surface water. Our findings support our hypothesis that the increase in mortality in the post-campaign environment for individuals with a contaminated shallow tubewell is due to mortality from diarrheal disease.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/18/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rachel&nbsp;Glennerster</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1226924/1226924_10212682_1482089512430_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1226924/1226924_10212682_1482089512430_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Under 2 Mortality Rate (0 -
