IGCC is technically cosponsored by IEEE, addresses key issues and topics related to energy efficiency in computing and promoting environmentally friendly computer technologies and systems. The conference aims to provide a forum to a wide audience for discussing, sharing and investigating the state-of-the-art for all aspects of green computing, which include energy-efficient use of computers, design of algorithms and systems for environmentally-friendly computer technologies, and wide range of related topics. The conference includes panels and publishes papers pertaining to hardware and software systems, algorithms, applications as well as power, energy and temperature related research areas of current importance to researchers, engineers and practitioners. The conference also includes forums and workshops on hot topics related to how the carbon footprint of computing can be reduced and how computers can contribute to the environment and overall well-being of the planet. IGCC is bringing a large audience of experts and industrial partners.\n\nThe conference program included a diverse set of papers that range from theoretical to practical, from scheduling to data centers, and from high-level software to low-level hardware design.  In response to the call for papers, the conference received submissions from 190 authors with affiliations in 16 different countries; all continents were represented, except for Africa.  Most submissions received 4 reviews, with some receiving 5 and none receiving less than 3.   The members of the program committee produced 85% of the reviews, whereas the others came from expert external reviewers.  The program committee accepted 18 high-quality submissions for the main conference program.  Several other quality papers were accepted for presentation in the Work-in-Progress workshop portion of the conference.\n\nIn addition to these papers, the program chairs and program committee actively sought speakers who could address important areas that had not been fully represented in past instantiations of IGCC.  As a result of this effort, IGCC 2012 included 5 exciting invited short/position papers from Thomas Dietterich (Oregon State University), Ryan Kastner (University of California at San Diego), Amir Roth (US Department of Energy), Nagiza Samatova (North Carolina State University), and Arunchandar Vasan (Tata Consultancy Services).\n\nThe IGCC 2012 program was rounded by two outstanding keynote speeches by Carla Gomes (Cornell University) and Greg Papadopoulos (Partner at NEA and former VP and CTO of Sun Microsystems).\n\nThe NSF travel funds were used to support 10 students from 6 universities to attend the conference.  Each student received a $1,000 travel stipend.\n\nOverall, the travel grant program was highly successful, providing opportunities for several students to attend the conference.  The students participated in the Student Forum Workshop and presented their research work in the area of sustainable computing.  The students had many opportunities to interact with senior researchers in the green computing area and enjoyed networking occasions with fellow student researchers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Behrooz A Shirazi"
