 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the development of a new method for inferring the choices people will make in possible situations from a variety of 'non-choice' data.  Many practical problems in microeconomics call for the researcher to predict the distribution of households' choices in not-yet-observed situations.   Economists prefer to draw such inferences from actual choices in a closely related domain.  However, this approach is sometimes problematic in practice because of the practical limitations of choice data.  For example, we may not have data about closely related choices, or we may have serious concerns about uncontrolled factors, selections, and the endogeneity of opportunity sets.\r\n\r\nThe new method uses non-choice data.  This method goes beyond current 'non-choice' methods such as the use of survey responses to include possible measures of passive physiological and neurological responses that have been widely studied in behavioral science.  The new approach has several features beyond the use of non-choice data.  The researchers focus on non-choice responses that are likely to have context-independent meanings over large collections of choice problems.  The researchers treat the decision problem as the unit of observation, and they treat the problem as one of optimal statistical prediction.  Finally, they want to determine whether and when these new methods are better than the standard method using imperfect choice data.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts are substantial.  The research could result in a new valuation method that could be used in addition to or instead of such methods as contingent valuation.  The result would be improvements in how microeconomics is used to analyze a broad array of practical questions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the main objectives of economic analysis is to evaluate the effects of public and private policies on the choices made by members of the affected populations.  Often, this objective proves difficult to achieve.  In some cases, we are interested in evaluating the effects of public policies that have not yet been implemented, which of course means we have had no chance to observe their consequences.  In other instances, adoption of the policy may be correlated with characteristics that affect the behavior of interest -- a possibility that makes the effects of the policy difficult to measure.  (For example, if firms provide employees with matching contributions for retirement plans, then the generosity of employer matches may be positively correlated with contributions, even if it actually fails to stimulate contributions.)  Economists have developed analytical methods to deal with these challenges, but they are not always applicable, and they sometimes require the analyst to make implausible assumptions.\n\nThe purpose of this research was to develop new methods for evaluating the effects of economic conditions on choices, using subjective assessments made by people who are not actually engaged in the choices (what we call \"non-choice data\").  As a starting point, imagine that the objective is to evaluate the effect on choices of a policy that has not yet been implemented.  One simple strategy is to take a survey, asking respondents (hypothetically) what they would choose with the policy in place, as well as without the policy.  If answers to hypothetical questions were accurate, we could then measure the effects of the policy simply by calculating the difference between the two answers.  Unfortunately, a large body of existing research establishes that answers to hypothetical questions are generally inaccurate, which means that this simple procedure is unreliable.  Despite this limitation, hypothetical questions and other forms of non-choice subjective assessments nevertheless contain statistical information about the choices people would actually make if the decisions were real.  That observation is the jumping-off point for our methods.\n\nIn this research, we have developed methods to extract the information about choices that is contained in non-choice subjective assessments, and use it to evaluate the effects of economic variables on choice.  We have developed theory to identify the conditions under which this method yields accurate answers, and have shown that the method works in settings that would otherwise be highly problematic.  We have validated our method by studying decisions made in a laboratory experiment, and we are currently in the process of providing further validation through a field experiment involving microlending.  In light of our successes, these methods can potentially expand the range of circumstances in which economists can reliably determine the effects of public policies.    \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/03/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas Bernheim"
