 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to support US-based scientists to attend the NSF/India Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) Workshop to be held in Bangalore, India, December 21-22, 2011. The participants include students and junior faculty from a cross-section of institutions and a cross-section of disciplines. The ground-floor participation of these investigators will help define the field, foster future collaborations, leverage strengths, and explore mechanisms for joint work. The US team will actively attend the workshop roundtables, describe their ongoing research, and point the way for future developments in the field. A final report articulating the essence of the workshop and the strengths of the collaborating teams will be made. \r\n\r\nA consequence of the massive proliferation of computers in all walks of life, scientific and social, has been the generation of large volumes of multi-dimensional data. The challenge of extracting actionable information from such large datasets has spawned the notion of the field Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E). For CDS&E to emerge as a viable scientific discipline, a multi-disciplinary and multi-national approach is envisioned. With the above in mind, this exploratory workshop in CDS&E aims to define the field, to address the major problems that it poses, to catalyze new thinking paradigms and practices, and in general to nurture collaborations among researchers in this nascent research area. The participation of the US-based scientists in the workshop will contribute to the development of CDS&E as a new academic discipline and will serve as a prototype for developing architectures for new Virtual Institutes. \r\n\r\nConference Website: http://nsfcac.rutgers.edu/cdse/us-india-workshop/",
