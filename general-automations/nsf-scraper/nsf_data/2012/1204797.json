 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving technician training and increasing the number of highly skilled workers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) priority areas. The goals of the project are to increase the number of female students in nine programs and to implement the proven educational strategy of problem-based learning for all students. The following nine programs are being impacted: Civil Engineering Technology, Computer Engineering Technology, Computer Information Technology, Electronics Engineering Technology, Information Systems Security, Mechanical Engineering Technology, Networking Technology, Surveying Technology, and Sustainability Technology. The college is partnering with three school systems, industry partners, the YWCA (for community outreach) and benefitting from the best practices of two established ATE Centers: the South Carolina Advanced Technological Education (SCATE) National Resource Center and CyberWatch. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project builds on effective practice as designed and implemented by its two ATE partners. This initiative groups core activities into three components: (1) recruiting female students; (2) retaining these students by supporting gender equity strategies; and (3) providing relevance through problem-based learning to all students, thereby connecting skills taught to the workplace. Student learning is improving through the institutionalization of problem-based learning adopted and adapted from SCATE and CyberWatch in first year courses in the nine identified engineering and technology programs. The comprehensive recruitment, support, and success strategies are being sustained through professional development integrated with program activities. Project development is based on the premise that problem-based learning, relationships, and a network of support are critically important to recruitment and retention of all students, particularly underrepresented populations such as female students in technology and engineering programs. Industry input provides support for adaptation of problems related to a variety of workplaces across the spectrum of technology and engineering. Problems designed by CyberWatch and SCATE are being utilized as well as problems available from other sources such as those developed for the Sustainability Technology program at Wayne Community College. Female recruitment and relationship building are being supported by an Ambassador program modeled after SCATE, professional associations, and other best practices. The membership of the college in the Achieving the Dream network and the Strategic Plan of the college document an institutional commitment to diversity, along with its capacity to institutionalize best practices.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The project is the result of numerous conversations, meetings, and relationships with industry. Growth during the economic downturn has highlighted the need for more skilled workers and drives the project goal of increasing the number and diversity of skilled technicians. Multifaceted outreach, recruitment, and support efforts are resulting in increased enrollment of female students in nine STEM programs. Faculty and administrative involvement are having an impact on the more than 300 students enrolled in these programs. Dissemination is through NC-NET (an online source for the 58 community colleges in North Carolina), the college web site, presentations at national and state conferences, and ATE partners.",
