 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program supports work by Professor Isiah Warner and his collaborators at Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College to explore the theoretical foundation of using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) for both mass and molecular weight determination of volatile organic compounds at the presence of a group of uniform materials based on organic salts (GUMBOS) and cellulose acetate (or other polymers). This research is based upon the researcher's recent discovery that in the presence of aforementioned composite sensing materials, the ratio of two parameters, which are simultaneously acquired during QCM measurements, can provide molecular weight estimates of absorbed molecules. In the proposed studies, the research groups will (1) conduct a detailed examination of sensing composites to achieve a full understanding of their characteristics to provide an appropriate ratio of df to dR; (2) develop computational methods and theoretical models to better understand how these composites function at a fundamental level; and (3) evaluate overall morphology and other properties of composites that contribute to optimal use in QCM measurements and analytical applications. Professor Warner will continue to actively engage undergraduate and graduate students of diverse backgrounds in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.",

In addition, we have developed a QCM virtual sensor array in which a single QCM sensor is used for discrimination of different closely related organic vapors.

We are currently assessing the quality of food samples by analyzing the volatile organic compounds emitted from these sources. In addition, we are analyzing different gasoline samples in order to assess gasoline quality.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/21/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Isiah M Warner"
