 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Anindya Ghosh from University of Arkansas Little Rock and colleagues Tito Viswanathan, Jeffrey Gaffney, Brian Berry and Darin Jones will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with broadband capabilities. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesis of ligands and catalysts for green chemistry applications; (b) synthesis of molecules for medicinal purposes; (c) synthesis of conducting polymers for photovoltaics; (d) self-assembly of polymer tethered nanoparticles; (e) synthesis of new donor materials for organic photovoltaics; (f) plant metabolonics; (g) chemical characterization of carbonaceous aerosols and humic materials in precipitation; (h) synthesis of metal complexes as cytoprotectors; and (i) proteomics.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research at the University of Arkansas Little Rock and neighboring institutions such as the historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff and Philander Smith College.",
