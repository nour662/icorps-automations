 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this grant is to develop new algorithms for scientific computations that involve integration of multiple computational modules and are accurate, efficient, robust, and scalable on thousands of processors.  Integration of multiple computational modules within a single framework becomes increasingly important with the rise in complexity of modern computations that tend to involve large-scale and/or multi-scale systems.  This project will concentrate on developing multi-domain capabilities within the high-order spectral-element fluid dynamics and heat transfer solver and ensuring high-order global accuracy and stability of the coupled algorithm.  The multi-domain capabilities will include overlapping and moving grid systems and can be applied to many important problems of multi-scale and multi-physics nature.  The algorithmic and computational developments will be systematically validated versus known analytical solutions and existing experimental data.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this effort will produce an accurate and scalable computational tool equipped with integrative capabilities to enable scientific computing in the 21st century, available as open source software under a public license.  The new tool will allow for efficient computational analysis of important problems of multidisciplinary nature.  One such problem is the performance of rotating wind turbines subject to complex atmospheric inflow, which can be more accurately predicted and optimized with the availability of the developed methods.  Modern computing advances and capabilities as well as their importance in solving realistic engineering problems will be a central theme for multiple outreach and educational activities, including participation of women in science trough Girls in Engineering Program at ASU, working with K-12 students and teachers in the Kyrene School District in Tempe, and organizing on-campus visits of national lab collaborators to expose students to the most recent advances in the field.",

The global spectral accuracy in space and high-order accuracy in time has been confirmed, which gives this methodology a unique accuracy advantage for high-fidelity simulations of complex problems involving complex geometry and/or moving components. With the developed methodology, we have investigated for the first time a physics of the interaction of a turbulent wake with a dynamically pitching airfoil [4, 5].</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> &nbsp;The developed methodology is one of its kind in maintaining its accuracy on overlapping moving grids, which will transform modern computational tools for predictive capabilities of flows in complex geometries to a higher level. The developed methodology was added to the main code <em>Nek5000</em> [6] as an open-source branch <em>Neknek</em>. PI has incorporated the results of this research into graduate courses ``Spectral Methods in CFD'' and ``Advanced Turbulence'' at Arizona State University. The Ph.D. student working on this project B. Merrill has defended his Ph.D. dissertation [7] in April 2016. The outreach activities included participation of the PI and her students in the Hands on Science Day, an outreach event hosting the middle school girls, the winners of the Arizona Science and Engineering Fair, on ASU campus.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Outcomes.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Overlapping domains:</em> In this project, we have developed a&nbsp;multi-domain integrative methodology in the spectral-element method that allows for a joint integration of solution of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on two and more overlapping subdomains [1], see Figure 1. On each of the two subdomains, the solution is sought independently. A global solution is formed by weakly coupling the subdomain solutions at the interfaces, by utilizing high-order explicit temporal interface extrapolation technique.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Moving domains:</em> An extension of the methodology to handle subdomains moving as rigid bodies has been implemented [2,3]. Solution on moving subdomains is handled with the help of Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian methodology. The computational advantage of the developed explicit methodology is that high-order accuracy is achieved <em>inexpensively</em>, with&nbsp;only a few number of iterations, as opposed to fully-implicit coupling strategies, where inter-domain iterations until convergence are performed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Accuracy, verification and validation:&nbsp;</em>The key aspect of our methodology is the retention of a global spectral accuracy and a high-order temporal accuracy for the coupled solution across the subdomains, on both overlapping and moving overlapping domains, see Figure 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The developed methodology was validated on several laminar and turbulent benchmark problems, as well as&nbsp;Direct Numeical Simulations of turbulent pipe flow, flow over a stationary and oscillating circular cylinder, flow over a rotating sphere [1-3]. We have applied the developed methodology to study the physics of dynamic stall of the pitching 3D airfoil [4, 5], with and without upstream disturbances, see Figure 3.</p>\n<p><em>Parallelization and scalability:</em>&nbsp;An efficient parallel implementation of the current methodology is achieved with the help of a specially-developed <em>integrative modular framework</em>. The basic idea of an integrative modular framework is to create a parallel infrastructure that allows several independent modules to be integrated within a single computational platform featuring full synchronization and real-time communication, see Figure 4. This approach is: 1) minimally-invasive; 2) parallel-friendly; 3) with easy load balancing; 4) flexible.</p>\n<p>Scalability tests were performed with two sub-domains on 1,024 cores on NSF SDSC Gordon and NSF TACC Stampede supercomputers, and nearly linear scaling has been attained for stationary and moving overlapping grid cases, see Figure 5. The &nbsp;percent change in global computation time from a single mesh to stationary and moving overlapping cases is shown in Figure 6. It is seen that, despite the increased complexity, the time increase is not dramatic. This demonstrates that the current overlapping moving grid methodology is equivalent to single-grid methods, in its computational complexity and parallelization efficiency, and is suitable for application to large-scale computations of complex problems.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>[1] B.
