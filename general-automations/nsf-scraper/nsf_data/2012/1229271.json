 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the development, testing, and deployment of models for multiple social networks, particularly those with conditionally independent ties.  The project will explore their properties with respect to partial pooling across networks, a case that includes a single network or ensemble of networks observed over time.  This research is motivated by problems in many sociological fields, particularly education research, in which multiple groups of people form their own networks, including students and teachers alike.  The project will build on preliminary constructions of the Hierarchical Latent Space Model and the Hierarchical Mixed-Membership Stochastic Block Model by focusing on how information can be pooled across networks, through hierarchical structure specification, and how model parameters evolve through time, through model-dependent autoregression or other smoothing methods.  Multiple ways in which an intervention can affect a subset of these networks also will be studied.  These models will use both simulated and real-world data to validate their effectiveness.  Standard methods for fitting these models, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo, will be used initially, though wider deployment of these models will demand the development of quicker inferential procedures based on Variational Inference and/or Sequential Monte Carlo.  Finally, model validation will be considered in each of these cases, in terms of comparison to other models as well as the adequacy of a model's fit to data.\r\n\r\n\r\nData on multiple social networks arising from the same generative mechanisms, and evolving over time together, are becoming increasingly available in education research, public health, and the social sciences.  Instead of treating each network separately or assuming that all come from exactly the same model (which is possible only in limited circumstances), this project will provide a new, clearly formulated methodology to deal with this type of data.  Researchers in related fields will have the opportunity to use the methods on their own research.  Computer code for these routines also will be made available.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSocial network analysis (SNA) is a collection of quantitative methods for comparing and measuring relationships among individuals in a network. SNA has been used as the basis of analyses of interpersonal relationships in clubs and other social groups, analysis of academic paper co-authorship and citations, development of online commercial recommender systems, as well as online social networks such as Facebook, Google+, etc. This project focused on two questions: how to decide which statistical model is appropriate for analyzing a single social network, and how to analyze a social network that is changing over time.  One graduate student was fully funded for the life of the project to investigate the first question.  His work, appearing in part on Arxiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03000) and in full in his PhD dissertation, develops a new cross-validation method (that is, a method that evaluates the utility of a statistical model by measuring its success in making predictions) that substantially outperforms the best previously-studied cross-validation method.  A second graduate student benefitted greatly from the atmosphere made possible by the funding of this project; her PhD dissertation develops statistical models and methodology for tracking changes in a social network over time, and applies this work to investigating changes in the professional social network of a group of school teachers over time, in response to changes in curriculum and testing in the school district in which they work.  In terms of intellectual impact, both PhD dissertations advance methodology for specifying, fitting, and assessing the fit of, generative probabilistic models for complex network data.  This is a fundamental contribution in the field of Statistics.  The work also finds application in education research (as indicated above), computational biology, epidemiology and other areas.  Not only the two PhD students mentioned have been trained, but also graduate students and researchers from a variety of disciplines have been trained in workshops made possible by this grant, widening the intellectual impact of the work.   In terms of broader impact, network analysis is a natural and important lens through which to see interactions among agents in many settings, from professional social environments to genomes.  Modeling and understanding these interactions leads to strategies for prediction and manipulation, which can improve outcomes in the workplace, in education, in biostatistics, in epidemiology, and in many other fields.  Our work contributes to these desirable social ends by providing new models and methodology &ndash; implemented in software pacakges HLSM and CIDnetworks which we have shared with the research community on http://cran.r-project.org) &ndash; that support correct, defensible planning and inference from social network data.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/23/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian W Junker"
