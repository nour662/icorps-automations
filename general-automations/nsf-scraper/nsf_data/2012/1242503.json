As networked devices in the home continue to proliferate, and the heterogeneity of devices in a typical home network increases, home networks are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to deploy, manage, and extend.\n\nThe average user faces many hurdles in making changes to a home network configuration to accommodate newdevices, applications, or circumstances; troubleshooting in today's home networks is also nearly impossible.  Finally, despite the development of services and applications that can take advantage of high-bandwidth connectivity into the home (e.g., video, smart grid), the home network infrastructure provides scant support for managing this diverse set of applications.\n\nWe are developing the Broadband Internet Service Benchmark (BISmark) toaddress the shortcomings that currently vex both users of home networksand Internet service providers.  BISmark is a software platform to provide Internet service providers and users better intelligence about the performance of their home network.  Software running on the platform will allow users to diagnose performance problems and manage resources in their home networks.  The cornerstone of the BISmark technology is custom router firmware that helps users of home networks and network operators both monitor their network performance and define network policies (related to prioritization of network traffic, security, parental controls).  The BISmark platform represents an opportunity to develop a broad range of applications for the home that will ultimately improve ISPs' ability to provide customer care, and users' ability tomonitor and manage their home networks.  \n\nIntellectual Merit: Home networks are an unexploredfrontier of modern communication networks.
