 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study ways to ease the production and\r\nuse of high-performance matrix algebra software. Matrix algebra\r\ncalculations constitute the most time-consuming part of simulations\r\nin diverse fields, and lowering the runtimes of those computations\r\ncan have a significant impact on overall application performance. The\r\nprocess of converting matrix algebra from algorithm to high-quality\r\nimplementation is, however, a complex one. At each step, the code\r\ndeveloper is confronted with a myriad of possibilities, many requiring\r\nexpertise in numerical computation, mathematical software, compilers,\r\nand computer architecture. In response to these difficulties, the PIs\r\nhave developed a prototype taxonomy implementation entitled Lighthouse,\r\nwhich is a guide to the linear system solver routines from the software\r\npackage LAPACK. It is the first framework that combines a matrix algebra\r\nsoftware ontology with code generation and tuning capabilities. Its\r\ninterface is designed for users across a spectrum of disciplines, career\r\nlevels, and programming experience.\r\n\r\nThe PIs will dramatically extend the Lighthouse framework in a number of new directions. \r\nFirst, they will construct a general taxonomy of software that can be used to build\r\nhighly-optimized mathematical applications. The taxonomy will initially\r\nprovide an organized ontology of software components for high-performance\r\nmatrix algebra and later other numerical software from a variety of\r\nproblem domains. It will serve as a guide to practitioners seeking\r\nto learn what is available for their mathematical programming tasks,\r\nhow to use it, and how the various parts fit together. Second, the PIs\r\nwill apply a combination of source code analysis and machine learning\r\ntechniques to fully automate the generation of parameterized models that,\r\ngiven representative inputs and a simple architecture description, can be\r\nevaluated to identify methods from various libraries that best reflect\r\nthe user's resource and performance requirements. This automation is\r\ncritical for ensuring that the taxonomy is comprehensive enough to be\r\nuseful and that it accurately reflects the features and performance\r\nof the latest versions of numerical libraries. Finally, the PIs will\r\nadvance the state-of-the-art in tuning tools by improving some of the\r\ntools included in the taxonomy, broadening their ranges of functionality\r\nin terms of problem domains and languages. This project will produce\r\nthe following impacts: greater performance by applications, enabling\r\nboth more discovery with available computing resources and greater\r\nproductivity of application programmers; greater understanding of the\r\ninteraction between architecture and algorithms; and an educational tool\r\nfor future computational scientists.",
