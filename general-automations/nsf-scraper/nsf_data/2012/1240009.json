The activities build capacity for a potential Noyce Master Teacher Fellowship (MTF) project and bring together a multidisciplinary team to enhance the strengths of Detroit area MTFs with explicit intention to cultivate an expanding cadre of excellent mathematics teachers and document their instruction in order to better understand and replicate successful mathematics teaching in high-poverty urban settings. Knowledge of these processes is essential for systemic improvement in mathematics education locally and nationally.   The partners are Detroit Public Schools, Wayne Westland Community Schools, and Wayne State University and they serve a diverse urban student body.  MEDeATe is working inside existing school structures with outstanding teachers who are already in place and is building from their strengths to expand excellent mathematics instruction.",
