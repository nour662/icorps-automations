 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the marine component of the Totten Glacier and Moscow University Ice Shelf, East Antarctica. This system is of critical importance because it drains one-eighth of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and contains a volume equivalent to nearly 7 meters of potential sea level rise, greater than the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet. This nearly completely unexplored region is the single largest and least understood marine glacial system that is potentially unstable. Despite intense scrutiny of marine based systems in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, little is known about the Totten Glacier system. This study will add substantially to the meager oceanographic and marine geology and geophysics data available in this region, and will significantly advance understanding of this poorly understood glacial system and its potentially sensitive response to environmental change.\r\n\r\nIndependent, space-based platforms indicate accelerating mass loss of the Totten system. Recent aerogeophysical surveys of the Aurora Subglacial Basin, which contains the deepest ice in Antarctica and drains into the Totten system, have provided the subglacial context for measured surface changes and show that the Totten Glacier has been the most significant drainage pathway for at least two previous ice flow regimes. However, the offshore context is far less understood. Limited physical oceanographic data from the nearby shelf/slope break indicate the presence of Modified Circumpolar Deep Water within a thick bottom layer at the mouth of a trough with apparent access to Totten Glacier, suggesting the possibility of sub-glacial bottom inflow of relatively warm water, a process considered to be responsible for West Antarctic Ice Sheet grounding line retreat. This project will conduct a ship-based marine geologic and geophysical survey of the region, combined with a physical oceanographic study, in order to evaluate both the recent and longer-term behavior of the glacial system and its relationship to the adjacent oceanographic system.  This endeavor will complement studies of other Antarctic ice shelves, oceanographic studies near the Antarctic Peninsula, and ongoing development of ice sheet and other ocean models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe ice sheet covering Antarctica is slowly drained into the ocean by glaciers, forming floating ice shelves at many locations around the Antarctic coast line. Generally speaking, the Antarctic continental ice sheet is a balance among snow falling over the continent, the slow movement of  the glaciers, ice bergs breaking off the glaciers and ice shelves, and melting of the ice as it meets the ocean.  The ice shelves act to slow the descent of glaciers from the higher elevations, buttressing the loss of ice to the oceans.  Where the ice shelves begin to float (the \"grounding line\"), the ice is in contact with the ocean, and the underside of the floating shelf melts from the grounding line to the seaward edge of the ice shelf.  The system of ice sheet-glacier-ice shelves and sea ice is often referred to as the cryosphere.\n\nIn recent times, with the advent of satellite and airborne measurements, we have come to realize that in some areas the ice sheet is thinning, implying that the system is locally not balanced.  It is hypothesized that the imbalance is due in large part to more rapid melting of ice along the undersides of the floating ice shelves, likely due to changes in the circulation of ocean water under the ice shelves bringing warmer water into contact with the underside of the ice closer to the grounding lines. \n\nThe Antarctic ice sheet is so thick that in some places the earth below the ice is depressed below sea level.  In these places, if the melting of the ice shelves buttressing the advance of the glaciers proceeds past the grounding line, the ocean can reach far inland into the sub-sealevel regions under the ice sheet.  This can theoretically create a runaway situation of more rapid melting, faster descent of the ice to the ocean, and thinning of the ice sheet.  The increased loss of ice from the ice sheet would result in a rapid increase in global sea level.\n\nThe Totten Glacier system in East Antarctica is one such region that is potentially sensitive to intensifying melting and rapid thinning.  Much research has been focused on glacier/ice shelf systems in West Antarctica in recent years where measurements clearly show rapid advance of the glaciers and thinning of the nearby ice sheet. These areas are generally accessible to ship-based measurement programs, with the sea ice retreating or at least decreasing in concentration during the Antarctic summer.  But where the Totten Glacier drains into the ocean, along the Sabrina Coast, the sea ice is usually very heavy, even in summer, affording only occasional access by ice-breaking research vessels (RVIB?s).  As a result, there are very few oceanographic measurements along the Sabrina Coast, especially near the Totten Glacier.  In fact, there are very few observations of the bottom depth or geology of the region, information critical to the understanding of the glacier movement and ocean circulation there.\n\nOur project (Collaborative Research: Totten Glacier System and the Marine Record of Cryosphere - Ocean Dynamics ) was designed to take the RVIB Nathanial B Palmer into the coastal region of the Sabrina Coast to collect data on the oceanography and geology of the region, in an effort to better understand how the ocean and cryosphere interact, and perhaps determine the rate at which the ice shelves were melting.  Knowing the melt rate is key to understanding the balance of the ice sheet system.  Mapping the ocean bottom and ocean properties is an important part of developing an overall understanding of the system, which includes developing computer models that rely on good observations of the shape of the ocean bottom (\"bottom morphology\"), especially the presence of troughs and channels that can steer ocean currents to the glaciers and ice shelves.\n\nThe project was a collaboration among many investigators and institutions.  This part of the project was focused on obtaining oceanography measurements of temperature, salinity and ocean currents.  Because the sea ice during the cruise of the N B Palmer in early 2014 was particularly heavy, we were unable to collect data in front of the Totten Glacier.  However, we mapped the ocean bottom and oceanographic properties in a previously unsampled region to the east, providing new observations that can be used by future projects, including computer modeling, to better understand this sensitive region of the Antarctic cryosphere/ocean interaction.\n\nAll of the data we collected is available on line [Antarctic Master Directory, record ID USAP-1143834 ], including the cruise report containing detailed descriptions of all of the components of the project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bruce A Huber"
