 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Professor Kubiak of the University of California, San Diego funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry focuses on ultrafast chemical reactions; those that occur in one-trillionth of a second (1 picosecond) over large supramolecular structures.   These reactions involve the transfer of electrons over reasonably long distances, from 1 to 4 nanometers.  The project builds on (1) the observation that exchanging electrons across hydrogen bonds can increase the strength of typically weak interactions; and (2) the observation of mixed valence nanoclusters. The latter are complex molecular structures composed of ruthenium clusters which transfer charge through attached metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles. The research will be extended to more complex systems in order to elucidate how electrons and electron transfer rates respond to different types of pathways through new supramolecular materials.  Given the ability to easily manipulate the chemical compositions of these complex systems synthetically, Professor Kubiak and his team are able to custom design these assemblies for a variety of applications. In order to explore these intricate structures, the researchers first aim to stabilize the complexes by increasing the strength of their weak interactions (such as hydrogen bonds) and to then analyze the ultrafast electron transfer properties in these newly stabilized complexes via spectroscopic methods designed for this purpose.  \r\n\r\nThe research is relevant to both the scientific and engineering communities in their quest to develop new generations of molecular electronic devices.  The future of such devices is dependent on the development of molecular complexes with two or more stable states, which can be switched between these states with extremely fast reaction times.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe study of electron transfer (ET) processes across large supramolecular structures such as proteins is critical for supporting life processes.  In protein ET, the pathways that electrons take from the electron donor site to the acceptor often cross hydrogen-bonds (H-bonds), some of the weakest known chemical bonds.   How and why H-bonds serve as conduits for electron transfer through biological systems is not well understood.  In this NSF project, some of the first studies of electron transfers between metallic centers linked by hydrogen bonds were undertaken.  The types of molecular systems studied are shown in structures of mixed valence dimers, (1)2- and (2)2- in Figure 1.   The electrochemical response of the monomer 1 and reduced dimer (1)2- are shown in Figure 2.  The response in CH2Cl2 (red) shows reduction at a more negative potential than expected and two return oxidations.  We have explained this in terms of the formation of a stable H-bonded structure in the mixed valence state (1)2- and a less stable, but observable doubly reduced dimer, (1)22-.  In DMSO (black, dashed), H-bonding is disrupted and the electrochemical response is that of the normal monomer 1 at precisely the average potential of the two return oxidative features arising from H-bonded mixed valency. These are the underlying scientific discoveries of electron transfer occurring through H-bonds   During the period of NSF support from this grant, several notable outcomes were achieved.  These are summarized below. \n\n \n\nI.  First discoveries of electronic communication across H-bonds by direct observation of spectral color changes in the near-infrared region.\n\nII. First measurement of the differences in the stabilities of H-bonds in the presence and absence of electron transfer through the H-bond.  Outcomes I and II are relevant to electron transfer in biological systems. \n\nIII.  Extension of our chemical investigations of electron transfer across weak chemical bonds to pi-stacking interactions similar to those found in graphitic materials.  This is relevant to the performance of devices constructed from graphene, especially how the graphene sheets can interact with the \"outside world\" they are connected to.\n\nIV.  We tested the limits of existing theories of electron transfer and measurement of dynamics by state-of-the-art two-dimensional time-resolved spectroscopy.  This is relevant to charge mobility in semiconductor devices.\n\nV.  We attempted to answer the question of how long it takes an electron injected into a molecule to achieve an electronically delocalized state throughout the molecule.  This is relevant to faster, smaller, and more efficient semiconductor devices.\n\nVI.  We designed and constructed a new generation Infrared Spectroelectrochemical Cells based on a glassy carbon working electrode.  These electrochemical cells have been used throughout our NSF sponsored research, and are the best way to measure the informative infrared spectrum of a chemical intermediate produced in an electrochemical reaction.  This is relevant for studying  electron transfer in samples that may contain water, such as catalysts used for making or oxidizing fuels at electrochemical potentials where water could interfere.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Clifford P Kubiak"
