 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nThe PI proposes an interdisciplinary, two-day workshop to be held in Indianapolis, Indiana in June 2012. The goal of this workshop is to facilitate discussion of research opportunities available from logistics hubs in the Transantarctic Mountains and reach a consensus on the site with the highest scientific priority. This prioritization will be based on which field site will provide a platform from which the most compelling mix of bio-, cryo-, geo-, and atmospheric science questions can be addressed to advance knowledge of the Transantarctic Mountains. This workshop will also develop a long-range plan to capitalize on research opportunities at other sites. A small group of scientists from the New Zealand Antarctic program will be invited to attend the workshop to maintain this historically strong partnership. The PI emphasizes that another objective of the TAM Camp workshop is to promote participation by new Antarctic PIs. To support this objective, they will have a special session on the third day of the workshop dedicated to logistics planning. In advance of the workshop, information about each potential site will be made available on a Google-based interactive website. The site will contain places for experienced PIs to post information on each proposed site from their past experiences and places for new investigators to post questions. This approach should provide bridges between scientists of differing levels of experience and possibly promote new collaborations.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nIn addition to providing training in the area of field planning for new investigators, this proposal would provide teaching and training opportunities for several undergraduate and graduate students at IUPUI who will help with website design and content development as well as workshop implementation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe logistical challenges of fieldwork in Antarctica are significant and this award provided funding to host a meeting of Antarctic researchers to select a site for a logistics hub that would maximize scientific progress while minimizing logistics costs and efforts.  Discussions focused on sites in the Transantarctic Mountains where rocks are exposed that provide the basis for geological studies and habitats for life in this extreme environment.  The efforts were led by K. Licht and an interdisciplinary Advisory committee of six research-active scientists from across the country with a broad range of relevant experience.  The meeting was preceded by an online survey of the Antarctic research community to identify top ranking sites to be discussed.  The meeting was held in Indianapolis June 25-27, 2012 with 62 participants from the atmospheric, biological, cryospheric and geological sciences in attendance.  To aid in building the next generation of polar scientists, travel expenses were covered for 15 postdocs, graduate students and scientists who had not previously participated as a principle investigator on Antarctic field-based proposals. \n\nAfter research themes were presented and discussed at the meeting, a consensus was reached that a logistics hub on the Shackleton Glacier would be the best site to pursue multidisciplinary research opportunities.  A key strength of the Shackleton Glacier site was the opportunity for the Biology and Ecology communities to begin a focused research program farther south than any other previous multi-investigator effort to date.  Following the selection of the Shackleton Glacier logistics hub site, the community interest in utilizing the Shackleton Camp resulted in strong proposal pressure, which warranted the logistics investment in the camp. This effort is now bearing fruit; in 2015-16 the first three science groups will be transiting through the Shackleton Camp, which is under construction.  It is planned to continue for an additional two years, with year three supporting the largest number of science projects.  Overall, the outcome from the 2012 meeting is installation of a temporary logistics hub at the Shackleton Glacier that will support dozens of scientists across several disciplines to make progress on a diverse array of scientific problems that can only be addressed through studies in the Transantarctic Mountains.\n\nBeyond facilitating compelling new science projects, this proposal supported the professional development of ~30 early career scientists and students.  To help prepare this next generation of scientists, the final day of the 2012 meeting was dedicated to presentations and discussions of field planning and the proposal preparation process for projects that involve fieldwork in Antarctica.  Throughout the meeting, students actively participated in the process of science and engaged in discussions with research leaders in the polar sciences.  One additional outcome of this meeting was the decision to hold a biennial scientific conference of the U.S. Antarctic Earth Sciences community to more effectively communicate new findings and promote new problem solving approaches.  Many of the critical questions cannot be solved by a single discipline and require an integrated \u00e6systems\u00c6 approach, which is the motivation for establishing a small, multidisciplinary meeting that fills an essential need of the U.S. Antarctic science community.  Future meetings will include dedicated time to evaluate the scientific need for logistics hubs that support Antarctic science in other difficult to access locations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/03/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kathy J Licht"
