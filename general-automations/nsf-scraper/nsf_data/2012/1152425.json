 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Mazziotti of The University of Chicago is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program for research to develop and implement quantum mechanical methods to compute the electronic structure of atoms and molecules.  The goal of this work is the direct determination of the 2-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) without the wave function. Applications of this method include excited states and conical intersections in photo-excited chemical reactions in combustion and atmospheric chemistry, steady states in non-equilibrium molecular conductivity, energy transfer in materials and biological processes such as bioluminescence and light harvesting, and various strong correlation phenomena.  The research aims to establish and improve 2-RDM methods for low-cost and strong- correlation computations via two general approaches: 1) Solution of the contracted Schrodinger equation; 2) Variational minimization of the energy with a 2-RDM constrained or parameterized by N-representability conditions.  Recent advances by Dr. Mazziotti and his group show that their method can recover strong electron correlation in molecular systems like firefly luciferin as well as acene chains and sheets whose wave functions, if computable, would span an octillion or more molecular configurations or determinants. \r\n \r\nThis work has a large impact on our ability to use quantum mechanics to study interesting, real-world systems that would be impossible with wave function methods. Dr. Mazziotti is continuing and extending a new annual publication that encourages high school students to pursue careers and research in the mathematical sciences. He is developing a graduate class that uses the general concept of reduced density matrices to unite areas of chemistry, physics and mathematics from electronic structure to quantum information.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nChemical prediction with quantum theory typically involves the solution of the many-electron wave function which encodes the probability for finding all of a molecule's electrons.  The wave function, however, contains much more information than required to predict molecular energies and properties.  Under the NSF grant  CHE-1152425 Mazziotti and his research group at The University of Chicago have made significant contributions to a new paradigm for treating atoms and molecules with quantum mechanics in which the energies and properties are expressed in terms of the probability density of just a pair electrons, formally known as the two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM).  Direct computation of the 2-RDM enables the treatment of strong electron correlation at non-exponential scaling. \n\nOptimization of the ground-state energy as a functional of the 2-RDM was made 100 times more efficient through a new algorithm in the family of optimization methods known as semidefinite programming (SDP).   The new SDP solver has recently allowed us to treat the reduction of a vanadium oxo complex (shown in Figure 1) with sextillion (1021) quantum degrees of freedom.  The calculations revealed that the electron is added not to the metal center as previously thought but to the five pyridine ligands (Figure 2 shows that the electron becomes delocalized among the pyridine ligands).  The ligand-centered reduction is stabilized by the entanglement of the electron among the five pyridine ligands, which act as non-innocent ligands.  An SDP algorithm was also developed by performing linear-scaling Hartree-Fock and density functional theories.\n\n2-RDM-based methods were also applied to studying the theoretical existence and structure of the olympicene molecule, which was synthetically developed for the 2012 Olympic games (Figure 3), the relative populations of the cis and trans isomers of carbonic acid at 210 K, the relative stabilities of the cage and prism structures of the water hexamer (Figure 4), and strong electron correlation at the conical intersection in photo-excited chemical reactions (Figure 5).  A constructive solution to the N-representability problem of the 2-RDM was presented, which generates all of the known N-representability conditions as well as new conditions.  Theoretical and computational advances were also made in the areas of photosynthetic light harvesting (Figure 6), time-dependent open quantum systems, and the reconstruction of a quantum system's structure and dynamics from experimental data.\n\nDevelopment of human resources included the training of sixteen graduate students, one postdoctoral fellow, and six undergraduates, and one high school student Claire Liu who was a semifinalist in the Intel Science Talent Search, publication of two book chapters, and a review article, the design of novel advanced graduate curricula, and outreach to encourage high schools students, especially women and minorities, to consider careers in the mathematical sciences.  A journal E = mc2: A High-school Science Magazine was published yearly with articles from high school students across the country who were selected for outstanding contributions in the mathematical sciences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Mazziotti"
