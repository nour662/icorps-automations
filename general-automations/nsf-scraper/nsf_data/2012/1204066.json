  "por_txt_cntn": "\nJack Huizenga worked as an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) under the supervision of sponsoring scientist Izzet Coskun.  Huizenga studies algebraic geometry, which explores the geometry of systems of solutions of polynomial equations.  The principal goal of the project was to extend results from Huizenga?s Ph.D. thesis to better understand the geometry of configuration spaces and moduli spaces.  These are geometric objects with profound application in such areas as theoretical physics, robotics, and other areas of mathematics such as topology and representation theory.\n\n \n\nIntellectual merit: While at UIC, Huizenga extended the results of his thesis to compute the effective cone of configuration spaces of points in the plane.  This is a fundamental question about the geometry of the configuration space, intricately related to the understanding of the global geometry of the space.  The fellowship then allowed the collaboration between Huizenga and Coskun, which lead to several further papers exploring this topic and further related questions.  In particular, Huizenga and Coskun studied the relationship between a new concept called Bridgeland stability and the geometry of moduli spaces of vector bundles.  During this time, nine original research articles on these topics were prepared for publication.\n\n \n\nBroader impacts: The main products of research were shared at many international and domestic conferences, including conferences in Japan, Germany, England, and South Korea.  The NSF postdoc also enabled Huizenga to engage in the training of graduate students and postdocs, both at UIC and at major conferences.  Huizenga taught a 1-semester minicourse on the geometry of vector bundles at UIC, training several graduate students and postdocs in this area.  Huizenga also taught a 4-week minicourse on the geometry of algebraic curves at the Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics in Hanoi, Vietnam.  The goal of this minicourse and a subsequent workshop was to jumpstart the involvement of Vietnamese mathematicians in the field of algebraic geometry.  Huizenga also served as a mentor for a group of graduate students and young postdocs at the 2015 Graduate Student Bootcamp in Algebraic Geometry at the University of Utah preceding the AMS Summer Research Institute in Algebraic Geometry.  The group studied the relationship between Bridgeland stability and and the geometry of configuration spaces, which resulted in the writing of a collaborative paper.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/25/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jack W Huizenga"
