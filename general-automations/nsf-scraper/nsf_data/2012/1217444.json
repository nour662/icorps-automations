 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop a cognitive radio system to provide reliable wireless communications to first responders. The ability to effectively use wireless is critical in emergency incident management and has been a major issue since 9/11 - with \"interoperability\" being the key phrase. The technology proposed is to develop a cognitive communication system capable of adapting its mode of operation autonomously according to the perceived needs of current situations to improve the reliability of current technologies.  The main capabilities of the proposed system will be to: (1) operate autonomously and in multiple modes, (2) optimize the system resources according to the current situation and user requirements, (3) minimize interference to other communication systems in the area, and (4) facilitate interoperability with existing and future communication systems. The objectives are to develop a system architecture for the proposed autonomous cognitive radio system, design and develop the cognitive engine for the proposed system and develop the proof-of-concept hardware of the proposed system. These objectives will address the main feasibility challenges outlined.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to transform current research efforts under the term of cognitive radio into a unified research effort, based on a top-level system approach, with clear future technology objectives. The approach will take the next steps to help realize a cognitive and reconfigurable multi-service/standard and multi-band operation, as well as enhanced wireless spectrum and power efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed effort will reduce the hardware complexity, the number of components, and provide a system at a lower cost in comparison to existing technologies today. The commercialization effort will be focused on delivering the autonomous cognitive technology to the first responder community, where there is an identifiable need for reliable wireless data, wireless voice and wireless video communications, especially in cluttered urban environments where the RF environment is overdrawn, spectrum is at a premium and is, RF-wise, extreme, at best. Finally, as part of the training of undergraduate and graduate students throughout this effort, the findings of this project will be made available to research and educational institutional to enable broader range of future applications and innovations.",
