 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award for a benchtop MALDI-ToF mass spectrometer to Georgia Southern University will impact a number of researchers in the Chemistry and Physics Departments there as well as researchers at Armstrong Atlantic State University.  The instrument will enhance the following research projects: 1) artificial bioactive polymers; new artificial polymers via hydroamination; 2) ROMP copolymers for binding to hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier; 3) biomass for catalytic conversion into liquid fuels; 4) repellent polymeric coatings and pH-responsive polymers; 5) potential iron chelation therapy drugs; 6) modified hemoglobin products; 7) porphyrin-based singlet oxygen sensitizers; and, 8) investigation of proteins in nanoparticles.  \r\n\r\nThe MALDI-ToF mass spectrometer will enhance the research culture at Georgia Southern by supporting the team's efforts in the multi-disciplinary and collaborative Material Science research focus area on campus.  Additionally, the instrument will improve undergraduate research training by enabling 'hands-on' experiences.  The instrument will also enrich the curriculum through the integration of a practical instrument component into lecture classes and laboratory courses for undergraduate students.  Finally, a multiple-student project is planned incorporating the instrument in the development of a YouTube video, which introduces and illustrates mass-spectroscopy techniques, in particular MALDI-ToF.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe awarded funds of the project DMR 1229292 were used to purchase a benchtop Matrix Assisted Lased Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometer.  The funds from NSF ($ 219,000) were allocated in September 2012.  In October 2012, a BRUKER Daltronics Microflex instrument was purchased and the instrument arrived in early January 2013.  The installation was completed on January 10, 2013.  \n\nThere is a strong emphasis in the Department of Chemistry concerning \"hands-on\" instrumentation use by undergraduate students and researchers.   Altogether, twenty two undergraduate researchers, eight graduate (Master\u00c6s) students and one postdoctoral fellow have used the instrument since operation started.  All users have received training from the instrument supervisor Dr. Takas and/or their respective research advvisers.  The vast majority of these students currently have or had clearance to use the instrument without supervision.\n\nIn order to maintain the philosophy of open access to community research instrumentation, the following steps were implemented:\n\nA) A sign-up sheet and log have been implemented to monitor and regulate all user access to the instrument.\n\nB) Operation and training are offered free of charge. \n\nC) Apart from the manufacturer repair in the spring of 2013, no downtime has exceeded 72 hours.  They were exclusively caused by maintenance activities.\n\nIntellectual Merit: The research of eight research groups (all located at Georgia Southern University within the Departments of Physics and Chemistry) has been supported by the instrument.  As measurable outcome, two publications and one submitted manuscript have been produced during the award time containing data from the proposed instrument.   Furthermore, thirteen presentations at national, regional and local conferences have included research data generated with the MADLI-ToF instrument.\n\nBroader Impacts:  The hands-on training of students (22 undergraduate, 8 graduate students and 1 postdoctoral researcher) and faculty has significantly heightened the level of hard research skills at  Georgia Southern.  Over 35 graduates from the Chemistry Department since the spring of 2014 have joined or applied to join a graduate (PhD and Master's) program in the sciences.  The MALDI-ToF instrument has contributed to their readiness and preparedness for their continued education.  Furthermore, the proposed Youtube video featuring the MADLI-ToF in mass spectrometry has been produced and has been a fixture in the laboratory component of Principles in Chemistry I.  There have been 55 class sections of 40 students or more which have completed this lab between the fall of 2013 to the summer of 2015.  This means, a minimum of 2200 undergraduate students have learned about mass spectrometry as a result of the instrument funding.    \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hans J Schanz"
