 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches\r\nThe objective of this research is to study new methods for crystalline silicon photovoltaics that allow significant reduction of active materials as well as integrated module designs for enhanced optical absorption. The approach is (1) to fabricate ultrathin, monocrystalline silicon solar cells as nanostructureddevice platforms, (2) to integrate them in engineered luminescent medium for spectral modification, and (3) to implement nanostructure-enabled light trapping schemes for optimized system performance.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe research will lead to the development of innovative materials platforms and fabrication strategies that can offer high performance, flexible silicon solar modules with significant reduction of materials cost.  The proposed studies will provide deeper \r\nunderstanding of optical processes associated with spectral upconversion and down-shifting when combined with schemes of nanophotonic light trapping, and their resultant synergistic effects on overall system performance of ultrathin silicon photovoltaic devices.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nScientific and technological advances from this research will contribute to the progress of making photovoltaic technologies cost-competitive with earth-abundant materials, providing a practical solution for the future global energy demand. Both graduate and undergraduate students will gain unique, interdisciplinary educational experience and training by engaging in the proposed \r\nresearch, where participation of students from underrepresented group will be highly encouraged. The PI will develop and \r\nconduct outreach programs for educationally-disadvantaged K-12 students in local community through the Center for Engineering Diversity at the University of Southern California.",

Printable forms of ultrathin nanostructured silicon solar cells were fabricated from wafer-based source materials, which can be printed on various foreign substrates including a sheet of plastics to form flexible solar modules, where 12.4% solar-to-electric conversion efficiency was demonstrated under simulated one sun illumination.

To enhance the absorption of longer wavelength photons, ultrathin nanostructured silicon solar cells were integrated with plasmonically enhanced upconversion medium composed of NaYF4:Er3+, Yb3+ nanocrystals. Both excitation and emission processes of upconversion luminophores are significantly enhanced by combined effects of surface plasmon resonance to amplify the light intensity at the excitation wavelength as well as to facilitate the far-field outcoupling at the emission wavelengths, respectively. The performance of the integrated solar module is improved by &asymp;13% compared to devices on a nanostructured plasmonic substrate without luminophores due to collective contributions from plasmonically enhanced spectral upconversion, together with effects of waveguiding and fluorescence of upconversion nanocrystals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. An&nbsp;integrated solar module of ultrathin, nanostructured silicon solar cells for simultaneously exploiting spectral upconversion and downshifting was studied. The ultrathin nanostructured silicon microcells in the composite luminescent waveguide exhibit strongly improved photocurrent and energy conversion efficiency than devices only with a single type of luminescent species owing to the synergistic contributions from optical downshifting, plasmonically enhanced upconversion, and waveguided photon flux for optical concentration, where the short-circuit current density increased by ~19% compared with microcells in a non-luminescent medium on a nanostructured silver substrate. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. Above-described outcomes from this project indicate great promise of this approach for large-scale implementation of nanostructured silicon solar cells, particularly for high-performance flexible photovoltaic modules.
