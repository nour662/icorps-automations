 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will support Jackson State University to offer training workshops and follow-on activities to develop mathematics faculty expertise in the use of Mathematica as a teaching, learning and research tool in the mathematical sciences and to promote year-long technology aided undergraduate research in the mathematical sciences. Each year, the program will attract 30 mathematics faculty from at least six HBCUs in Mississippi and neighboring states and is intended to achieve the following specific objectives: (1) train 30 HBCU faculty each year for two years to gain expertise in integrating the Mathematica software in the teaching and learning of calculus and upper division mathematical sciences courses, (2) allow each participating faculty member to engage at least one mathematical sciences major from their institution in a year-long research experience and place them in summer research experience at other institutions, and (3) train each participating faculty on how to develop Mathematica course guidelines and manuals integrating programming with Mathematica and course delivery.   \r\n\r\nThe proposed program activities are structured to serve as a forum for learning, discussion and exchange of information on the use of technology in teaching, learning, and research in the mathematical sciences. Sessions will be held on the most effective ways of teaching undergraduate courses such as discrete mathematics, linear algebra, differential equations, operations research and matrix theory, and numerical analysis which are inherently numerical with the computer programming platforms such as Mathematica. The participating HBCU mathematics faculty will engage in national and international intellectual conversations to address questions of satisfaction with technology and student learning gains and to disseminate the best practices of technology-assisted teaching and learning of mathematics.  The findings of the projects will be shared with academic institutions and intellectual and professional communities through conferences, journal publications, and workshops and on the Jackson State University web sites and departmental web pages.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project supported Jackson State University to (1) develop mathematics faculty expertise at participating HBCUs in the use of Mathematica as a teaching, learning and research tool in the mathematical sciences, and (2) promote year-long technology aided undergraduate research in the mathematical sciences at HBCUs.  The expertise development was done through two organized hands-on Mathematica learn-how-to workshops and to follow-up mid-year workshops.  The workshops were scheduled in May at the end of the Spring semester for two days.  Participants learned Mathematica as mathematics software, a programming platform, and how to integrate it with teaching the calculus sequence.  The follow-up mid-year workshops were organized in January of each year, preceding each May training workshop.  They focused on participants giving feedback on the progress they made in integrating Mathematica in the teaching and learning of mathematics at their institutions. Curricula development for calculus and upper level mathematics courses were also discussed.  The project  evaluators met with participants during the mid-year workshop to examine how the Mathematica training workshops impacted HBCU mathematics faculty in teaching mathematics and student learning gains and interests in the mathematical sciences research.  Twenty three faculty members from six HBCUs in three states participated in at least one training workshop and mid-year workshop.  Seventeen of the twenty three completed the training.  Together, they engaged thirty one undergraduate students in authentic research work using Mathematica as a computational tool.  A total of 18 students attended presentation meetings and professional conferences.  About ten students participated in internships or Summer undergraduate research experience at other universities.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  Mathematics faculty members participating in the project from five HBCU institutions engaged undergraduate mathematics majors in a year-long research activities.  As acknowledged in their publications, the project support helped to raise the level of faculty research activities and the use of technology in teaching and learning mathematics.  The level of undergraduate mathematics majors interested in Summer research internships or Research Experience for Undergraduate students at other universities or governmental agencies has also risen.\n\nBroader Impact:  The faculty member participants in the project were invited to participate in the outreach activities of the EXTREEMS-QED (an NSF funded project at JSU) project.  A Wolfram research, Inc. Mathematica 9 in Education and Research workshop was held at Jackson State University.  Twenty students and ten faculty members across Jackson State University participated in Mathematica workshops.  Wolfram also held workshops by invitation at the campuses of the other participating institutions.  A mathematics faculty member from the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff participated in the May 15-16, 2014 Mathematica Training Workshop indicating a broadened interest in technology among HBCUs mathematics faculty members.  The PI presented the project poster at the National Science Foundation Workshop organized by Jackson State University, November 28, 2012.  One of the Co-PI's presented a paper on the project at the 5th International Conference on Acceptable Technology held in Pretoria, South Africa from November 20-24, 2012.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tor A Kwembe"
