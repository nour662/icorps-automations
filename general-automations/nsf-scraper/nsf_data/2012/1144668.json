 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project comprises an experimental study examining (a) the effects of thermodynamic potentials?temperature, pressure and, particularly, chemical potentials of oxygen, oxides and halides?on the formation and persistence of extended defects in olivine and (b) the effect of such extended defects on transport coefficients of rare earth cations and halide anions.  The analytical techniques to be employed for characterization of the defects emphasize high-resolution, energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (TEM; HRTEM) and (local-electrode) atom-probe tomography (APT; LEAPTM).  The proposed APT work is developmental: we are among the earliest investigators in the petrology community attempting to apply this promising technique?in which one can characterize the location within a crystal of specific atoms (and potentially isotopes)?to the characterization of minerals (which are, to first order, electronic insulators) and of mineral reactions.\r\n\r\nThe capability of the Earth and planetary sciences community to understand the thermomechanical and thermochemical evolution of the terrestrial planets requires a deep and supple understanding of ionic diffusive dynamics in silicate and oxide mineral and their melts.  Because of the number of chemical components in geological systems, there are a variety of kinetic paths available for diffusion-effected reactions, particularly under conditions of a high driving potential, i.e., where phases out of equilibrium with one another are suddenly placed in contact.  This situation happens frequently in nature; it happens almost always in experiments used to understand mineral dynamics.  For example, this research addresses directly a current controversy in petrology where the transport coefficient for rare-earth cations in ferromagnesian olivine has been measured in different experiments?both considered authoritative and ?good??and yet indicate a kinetics difference of almost 104!  Metastable (and perhaps transient) defect structures in olivine in the faster case are anticipated; we will characterize these structures, their thermochemical persistence and their impact on dynamics. \r\n\r\nThis project will (a) educate a graduate student in these particular aspects of petrology, mineral physics and ionic materials science and (b) discern the possibilities and develop the approaches of APT/LEAPTM for application to minerals and synthetic, multicomponent oxides.  The research has application, also, to the design and characterization of new materials for use as oxide electrodes in batteries and fuel cells.  Our work will emphasize petrology; we are, however, aware of the potential of the research for societal needs with regards to energy technology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAward Title: Extended Defects in Olivine and their Impact on Diffusive Reaction Kinetics\n\nFederal Award ID: 1144668\n\nReid F. Cooper and Stephen W. Parman, Principal Investigators\n\nThe scientific impetus for this research program initially was the characterization of transient extended defects in olivine and their potential to affect/effect an enhancement in the kinetics of solid-state reactions.  Using transmission electron microscopy, we have discovered the presence of such defects when olivine is reacted with a silicate melt that, while olivine-saturated, contains incompatible ionic species far from equilibrium with the olivine. \n\nThe practical emphasis of the research was the application of atom probe tomography (APT) to issues of reaction-affected defects in minerals.  Atom probe tomography is a sub-nanometer-scale analytical technique in which a specimen, fabricated into a micrometer-scale fine needle having a nanometer-scale-radius tip, is field evaporated; a time-of-flight mass spectrometer that employs a high-capacity solid-state detector allows a computer-generated image to be created whereby every atom is identified by its mass/charge ratio and its actual initial location in the crystal.  The technique works all-but-perfectly for metals.  Much research, specifically employing a pulsed-laser assist to field evaporation, has allowed the technique to be applied successfully to semiconductors; indeed, APT is now an important analytical technique within the electronic-device/microchip industry.\n\nAPT has the potential for revolutionizing petrology, but the big question is: are natural minerals \"semiconductor enough\" to allow appropriately useful field evaporation of component ions and their characterization in time-of-flight spectrometry?  While other research groups have applied successfully APT to the study of U-Pb structural/nuclear dynamics in zircon (ZrSiO4), where there are essentially no potential mass/charge overlaps in the data collection, our emphasis has evolved within the program to apply APT to problems in upper-mantle petrology and geochemistry.\n\nAPT of olivine ([Mg,Fe]2SiO4) and pyroxenes (orthopyroxene [Mg,Fe]SiO3 and clinopyroxene Ca[Mg,Fe]Si2O6) is a challenge for it is not only individual ions that field evaporate; significant evaporation of polyionic clusters occurs, a manifestation of the significant variations in bonding energy in the crystals (e.g., Si&ndash;O bonds are far stronger than Mg&ndash;O bonds, which, in turn, are stronger than Ca&ndash;O bonds).  The result is significant mass/charge signal overlap: a particularly pernicious example is that for Ca2+ and the polyion [Mg&ndash;O]2+, both of which have a  mass/charge ration of approximately 40/2.  One result is difficulty in \"reconstructing\" the crystals in data analysis, e.g., imaging individual planes of ions. (Our continuing research seeks to identify rigorously defensible approaches to calibrate spectra so as to overcome this problem.  We are optimistic.)\n\nWe have successfully applied APT to the characterization of chemical segregation and \"chemical width\" of grain boundaries and heterophase boundaries in wehrlite (olivine-clinopyroxene) aggregates that were subjected to high-strain plastic deformation (see Figure). To effect its lowest steady-state viscosity, the deforming polyphase aggregate self-organizes to maximize the spatial density of heterophase boundaries. Scrutiny of the boundary chemical widths reveal that the heterophase boundaries are 50&ndash;60% wider than are grain boundaries (~8nm compared to ~5nm); the larger chemical width facilitates more rapid chemical diffusion along the boundaries, a requirement for the grain sliding necessary for homogeneous plastic deformation of rocks consisting of distinctly mechanically anisotropic minerals such as olivine and pyroxene.\n\nThe results have potential application to engineering materials: the use of plastic deformation to create spatially hierarchical materials with unique physical properties.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/11/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Reid F Cooper"
