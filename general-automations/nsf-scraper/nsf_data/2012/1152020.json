 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor D. Tyler McQuade of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Florida State University will develop new synthetic methods by creating (1) stereoconvergent allylic substitutions, providing the same stereoisomer for both cis and trans substrates; (2) catalyst-controlled reactivity where neighboring stereocenters have limited impact on diastereoselectivity; and (3) regiocontrolled catalytic hydroborations. As rare metals such as rhodium and iridium become more expensive, it is critically important to increase the range of reactions that can be performed by inexpensive metals such as copper. The resulting methods could be more efficient and selective than prior reactions and could enable new strategies to construct valuable complex molecules from less expensive metals, providing the basic science necessary to improve sustainability. \r\n\r\nThe proposed work is predicted to result in not only a more thorough understanding of catalysts that provide greater chemical control but also the creation of promising new synthetic methods. The successful results of this work will positively impact the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and specialty chemical industries. In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, from undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.  These students will become the vanguard, leading the way into a future of more environmentally-friendly and internationally-competitive organic chemistry.",
