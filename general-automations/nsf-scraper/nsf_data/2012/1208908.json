 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a research project in the general area of dynamical systems theory with applications to problems arising in mechanics, especially celestial mechanics.  The gravitational n-body problem remains an active topic for research three centuries after Newton proposed it.   In addition to its direct relevance for astronomy and space mission design, it has served as a stimulus for the development of new mathematical techniques.  The research is focussed on three main areas: regularization of singularities, topological and variational existence proofs for periodic orbits, and studies of relative equilibrium solutions.  One of the characteristic features of celestial mechanics is the presence of collision singularities.  It has long been known that simple binary collisions can be ``regularized'' by cleverly chosen changes of coordinates.  More complicated singularities like the triple collision in the three-body problem can be ``blown-up'' so as to reveal the quite complicated behavior of near-collision solutions.  Part of the proposal is to give a complete regularization and blow-up for the three-body problem which combines the older work on the subject with modern developments in symplectic reduction theory.   A similar project for the four-body problem will involve many new ideas and has surprising connections to algebraic surface theory.   \r\n\r\nPeriodic motions have always played an important role in dynamical systems theory.  They are often the simplest solutions of the equations of motion and provide a framework for understanding other, more complicated solutions.   Recently, variational methods have been used to construct some remarkable symmetric periodic solutions of the n-body problem.  This project will develop topological techniques for finding such solutions and will explore the relationship between the variational and topological approaches. The simplest periodic orbits arise from central configurations -- special arrangements of the masses such that the gravitational forces can be exactly balanced by centrifugal forces when the configuration rotates.  It is a difficult algebraic problem to find or even count the central configurations.  Techniques developed for this problem could be applied to other complicated systems of algebraic equations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Newtonian N-body problem has inspired mathematical research for several centuries.  Most of the practical problems about the motion of planets and asteroids and the planning of space missions are handled with computer simulations these daya.  But there are many fundamental theoretical questions about the possible motions which continue to challenge mathematicians.\n\nTwo of the most important features of the problem are its symmetries and its singularities.  The problem is symmetric under rotations and translations:  if the initial states of all of the bodies are rotated or translated, then the motion of the bodies for all time will be similarly rotated or translated.   Singularities can arise when the bodies collide, at which point Newton's equations of motion are no longer valid.  \n\nPeriodic orbits, which return to their initial states after some time, perhaps up to an overall rotation and translation, are the simplest and most familiar types of solutions to the equations of motions, but much more complicated behavior is possible.  \n\nThis research project has mainly been devoted to developing new mathematical techniques for understanding periodic orbits, using the symmetries of the problems to eliminate some of the variables, and to analyzing the complicated dynamics which can occur near the collision singularities.\n\nBased on many the ideas of many previous researchers, new coordinates were developed which eliminate the symmetries, and allow the motions near collisions to be studied in detail, at least for the planar three-body problem.  In related work, a detailed study of orbits a near triple collision showed that periodic motions of incredible complexity occur in the three-body problem.  The complexity is measured by how tangled the resulting trajectories appear in a certain coordinate system and the result is that orbits of any specified complexity exist.\n\nIn contrast to these complicated solutions, another part of the project looked at the simplest possible periodic motions in a special case of the four-body problem where three small planets rotate around a fourth large one.  The simplest orbits, called relative equilbria, are such that the relative positions of the bodies are fixed and the whole system just rotates rigidly around the big mass.  The problem of finding all such motions involves solving a complicated systems of algebraic equations.  Depending on the relative sizes of the bodies, different numbers of solutions may be obtained.  The equations oare too complicated to solve by hand, but new computer algebra methods were developed to completely analyze the problem. \n\nBesides the Newtonian problem, there are many interesting and important problems in the general area of mechanics.  Among them is the famous Foucault pendulum.  This is just a spherical pendulum on a rotating planet.  Foucault's goal was to demonstrate the rotation of the earth by having the pendulum move initially in a vertical plane which then slowly precesses due to the rotation of the earth.  There is a complicated interaction between the nonlinear effects from the pendulum and the rotational effects from the planet.  While many papers have been written on the subject for over a century, it turns out that there were some interesting aspects to investigate.  I showed that under certain conditinos, the whole problem can be reduced to a twist mapping of an annulus, a type of dynamical system which has been well studied recently.  Among the implications are the existence of periodic motions, which do not precess at all and orbits which precess in the wrong direction.  Moreover, these motions are disturbingly close to the nearly planar ones envisioned by Foucault.\n\nThe results from the project have been published in mathematics journals.  In addition I have engaged in expository writing in the form of a book chapter and an internet article.  Finally, I have mentored Ph.D. students working on similar topics.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/06/20..."
