 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant is to develop a fundamental understanding of the structure and properties of DNA-functionalized surfaces and to formulate rules that will facilitate the design of new functional materials for biosensors and enhance our ability to control and direct the materials assembly processes. Surfaces functionalized with DNA are used for biosensing or for the self-assembly of biological, organic and inorganic moieties. DNA density and structure on the surface, choice of surface material and curvature, and type of surface immobilization can significantly influence the properties of DNA-functionalized surface and the behavior of DNA-based material assembly. This study will utilize molecular modeling techniques to formulate a theoretical description of the correlation between DNA structure, surface design and properties of DNA-functionalized surfaces.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the research will facilitate progress in materials for DNA microarrays and biosensors, DNA based targeted drug delivery, DNA nanomaterials assembly, and DNA directed surface assembly and patterning. The proposed research program will be closely integrated with the educational activities and will provide new education opportunities in disciplines related to DNA and functional surfaces for high school, graduate and undergraduate students. The results from this research will be integrated into a new course addressing nanoscale simulations and modeling. This project includes an outreach module on materials design for high and middle school students.",
