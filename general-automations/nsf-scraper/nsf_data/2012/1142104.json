 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nThe role that Antarctica has played in vertebrate evolution and paleobiogeography during the Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene is largely unknown. Evidence indicates that Antarctica was home to a diverse flora during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene, yet the vertebrates that must have existed on the continent remain virtually unknown. To fill this gap, the PIs have formed the Antarctic Vertebrate Paleontology Initiative (AVPI), whose goal is to search for and collect Late Cretaceous-Paleogene vertebrate fossils in Antarctica at localities that have never been properly surveyed, as well as in areas of proven potential. Two field seasons are proposed for the James Ross Island Group on the northeastern margin of the Antarctic Peninsula. Expected finds include chondrichthyan and osteichthyan fishes, marine reptiles, ornithischian and non-avian theropod dinosaurs, ornithurine birds, and therian and non-therian mammals. Hypotheses to be tested include: 1) multiple extant bird and/or therian mammal lineages originated during the Cretaceous and survived the K-Pg boundary extinction event; 2) the ?Scotia Portal? permitted the dispersal of continental vertebrates between Antarctica and South America prior to the latest Cretaceous and through to the late Paleocene or early Eocene; 3) Late Cretaceous non-avian dinosaurs from Antarctica are closely related to coeval taxa from other Gondwanan landmasses; 4) terminal Cretaceous marine reptile faunas from southern Gondwana differed from contemporaneous but more northerly assemblages; and 5) the collapse of Antarctic ichthyofaunal diversity during the K-Pg transition was triggered by a catastrophic extinction.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nThe PIs will communicate discoveries to audiences through a variety of channels, such as the Dinosaurs in Their Time exhibition at Carnegie Museum of Natural History and the outreach programs of the Environmental Science Institute of the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, Carnegie Museum will launch a student-oriented programming initiative using AVPI research as a primary focus. This array of activities will help some 2,000 Pittsburgh-area undergraduates to explore the relevance of deep-time discoveries to critical modern issues. The AVPI will provide research opportunities for eight undergraduate and three graduate students, several of whom will receive field training in Antarctica. Fossils will be accessioned into the Carnegie Museum collection, and made accessible virtually through the NSF-funded Digital Morphology library at University of Texas.",

The goals of the AP3 are to recover Cretaceous and Paleogene fossils from the James Ross Basin (JRB) of the Antarctic Peninsula and to place these discoveries in robust geological, environmental, and ecological contexts. Collectively, the AP3 team has expertise in all major fossil vertebrate (backboned animal) groups that have been recorded from the Antarctic Cretaceous and Paleogene, as well as expertise in the study of ancient plants, ecosystems, and environments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit&mdash;</strong><em>Fieldwork.</em> The AP3 conducted a successful field season in the JRB during February&ndash;March 2016. The team recovered more than 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) of fossils comprising over 300 individual specimens that collectively belong to Cretaceous and Paleogene plants, invertebrates, fishes, marine reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, and mammals (Fig. 3). Most notable among these are (1) dozens of fossil fishes, most of which come from a rock layer that dates to the Cretaceous&ndash;Paleogene (K&ndash;Pg) boundary, the point in Earth history when all dinosaurs (except their descendants, birds) became extinct; (2) bones belonging to a predatory dinosaur that was first discovered in 2003; and (3) Paleogene bird material, including a penguin jaw and foot bones that likely represent two new species. The AP3 team also collected abundant geological data from rock units in the JRB. Specimens collected during the 2016 expedition are currently under study.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Publications and laboratory research.</em> The AP3 has produced 14 publications to date. Among the most significant of these is PI Clarke&rsquo;s 2016 first-authored paper in the preeminent scientific journal <em>Nature</em> on the origins of the avian vocal organ, the syrinx, based on a fossil of the Cretaceous bird <em>Vegavis iaai</em> from Vega Island in the JRB. The syrinx of this <em>Vegavis</em> specimen is the most ancient discovered, and attests to the potential of the JRB to preserve structures that are rarely encountered in the fossil record. Another important AP3 contribution is a reassessment of the Cretaceous geology of Vega Island. Over the course of this research, the project team discovered what may be a continuous rock section through the K&ndash;Pg boundary; if verified, study of this section could yield new insights into the end-Cretaceous extinction in Antarctica. Numerous other AP3 studies are currently in progress.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts&mdash;</strong><em>Student training.</em> Three Ph.D. students&mdash;two of whom have since earned their degrees&mdash;participated in the 2016 AP3 expedition: Eric Gorscak (OU), Christopher Torres (UT), and Abagael West (AMNH). West and Gorscak are now postdoctoral researchers at CM and the Field Museum of Natural History, respectively. During the 2016 expedition, these students gained valuable field experience and took part in associated public outreach endeavors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Public outreach.</em> AP3 members have been active with respect to public outreach. Among the most significant activities in this regard occurred in January 2016, when the project launched its website (<a href=\"http://antarcticdinos.org/\">http://antarcticdinos.org</a>) and Twitter account (@antarcticdinos). The AP3 also conducted several real-time outreach events during the 2016 expedition. In addition to dozens of live Tweets (many of these sent directly from field camp using satellite communicators) and blog posts, these included multiple videoconferences and a Reddit &ldquo;Ask Me Anything&rdquo; session that generated more than 400 questions and responses. Furthermore, thanks to additional NSF support, the 2016 expedition was accompanied by cinematographer Matthew Koshmrl. The hundreds of hours of expedition footage that Koshmrl obtained have formed the basis for educational films produced by CM and UT. The CM film, <em>Expedition Antarctica</em>, is accompanied by a live-action program that conveys the scientific activities of the project and life in an Antarctic field camp to young museum audiences. AP3 personnel have also given numerous public presentations on project research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Media activities.</em> The AP3 has generated widespread media attention, most of which has centered on the 2016 expedition. For example, a media release following the expedition led to extensive coverage (1.2 million loads and 28,700 views in one month) in such prominent venues as <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Discover</em>, and <em>Forbes</em>.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/14/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Patrick&nbsp;M&nbsp;O'connor</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1142104/1142104_10176991_1523708661679_Outcomesreportfigures_Page_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1142104/1142104_10176991_1523708661679_Outcomesreportfigures_Page_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"AP3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1142104/1142104_10176991_1523708661679_Outcomesreportfigures_Page_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"AP3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The 2016 Antarctic Peninsula Paleontology Project expedition to the James Ross Basin.
