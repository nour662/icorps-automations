 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Ocean is a source of great uncertainty and large potential change in predictions of the future carbon-climate system.  In this project, a research team at the University of Colorado at Boulder will develop improved numerical models to better predict the rate of Southern Ocean carbon uptake over the next several decades to centuries. This will require a thorough understanding of the variable and changing carbonate chemistry of the Southern Ocean, including better constraints on the present-day mean state and seasonal cycle, quantification of past variability, and characterization of key processes driving change in the future. The primary numerical tool for this project will be the Community Earth System Model (CESM), a state-of-the-art Earth system model with fully interactive marine ecosystem and global carbon modules.  Output from hindcast and 21st century CESM simulations, hydrographic data, and satellite data products will be used to understand model biases, interpret variability, and quantify carbon-climate feedback strength. \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives are to: (1) analyze biases in, and guide improvement of, the Southern Ocean alkalinity cycle in the CESM; (2) quantify multi-decadal changes in modeled Southern Ocean carbonate chemistry over the last 60 years, and validate these trends with satellite and hydrographic data sets;  (3) identify drivers of interannual to multi-decadal variability in Southern Ocean carbonate chemistry; and (4)quantify carbon feedbacks in the Southern Ocean due to changes in acidification, stratification, and wind-driven circulation. \r\n\r\nBy quantifying past variability in the inorganic carbonate chemistry of the Southern Ocean, and identifying the physical and ecological processes that modify carbonate chemistry here, this project will offer new insights into the changing rate of Southern Ocean carbon uptake and acidification. The vast user base of the CESM stands to benefit from the proposed improvements in the representation of biogeochemistry and ecology in the CESM. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This research will lead to a better understanding of the future evolution of the global carbon-climate system, which is of direct benefit to society. Results from this work will be widely disseminated in the scientific community through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentation at scientific meetings.  It will support an early-career scientist and the development of her research group.  The PI is a mentor for the Summer Multicultural Access to Research Training program at her home institution, which aims to provide hands-on experience in research and an introduction to graduate education to undergraduate students who are members of racial/ethnic groups severely underrepresented in science, math, and engineering.   The project will support the education and training of two graduate students. Significant research findings from this project will be incorporated into the curriculum of four courses at the University of Colorado.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Southern Ocean (the ocean south of roughly 35 degrees South latitude) plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle: the high latitudes are characterized by ventilation of carbon-rich waters from the deep ocean, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  In the mid-latitudes, mode and intermediate water formation provides a pathway for the ocean to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Nearly 40% of fossil fuel carbon enters the ocean via this pathway, so it is critical to understand carbon fluxes in this region of the ocean.  This project provided new insight into the changing rate of Southern Ocean air-sea carbon fluxes and the associated ocean acidification by quantifying past variability in the inorganic carbonate chemistry of the Southern Ocean and characterizing the relevant ecological processes.  This was accomplished by analyzing output from several simulations of a climate model that included a representation of ocean biogeochemistry and ecology and by analyzing freely-available carbonate chemistry and satellite data from the Southern Ocean region.  The project supported graduate studies for 4 students and undergraduate research experiences for 7 students, 3 of whom are from underrepresented groups.  The project produced 17 peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals, 6 of which are graduate student first-authored papers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicole S Lovenduski"
