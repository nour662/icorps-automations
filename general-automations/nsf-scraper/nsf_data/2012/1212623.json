Yet there is growing evidence that yields in many fields remain low, showing little response to fertilizers. There is limited understanding of where, why, and how this soil and crop non-responsiveness occurs. Nutrient inputs that drive the African Green Revolution on the nutrient depleted soils of the continent must be efficiently targeted and managed to realize the benefits of improved crop germplasm. The project has four objectives: (1) quantify the occurrence of crop non-responsiveness to mineral fertilizers as related to soil type, topography/landscape, and management practices, (2) characterize the soil processes and properties that result in crop non-responsiveness to mineral fertilizers, (3) evaluate rapid and cost effective field tools for diagnosing these soil factors, and (4) construct a decision tree for targeting improved management options for non-responsive soils. State-of-the art analytical methods will provide the quantitative characterization of chemical, physical, and biological soil factors underlying non-responsiveness. Expected outcomes include: 1) information on the extent and location of non-responsive soils, 2) description and quantification of the soil factors that contribute to non-responsiveness, 3) efficient and cost-effective field tools to characterize and diagnose soils in terms of non-responsiveness, and 4) decision tools for soil management options to manage and rehabilitate non-responsive soils.\r\n\r\nThe project will make a substantial contribution to science and methodologies guiding sustainable agricultural production in Africa.  A field test kit coupled with a decision tree for diagnosing and managing non-responsive crops/soils will be developed for researchers, policy makers, extension services, and farmers aimed at targeting nutrient management recommendations. Interactions with national scientists and institutions in Africa will develop capacity, knowledge, and methods required to increase and scale up the impact of the African Green Revolution on the productivity of smallholder farms. The project will also mentor, train, and support graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the United States and Africa through the PI, co-PIs, and collaborating scientists in the project who have all been involved in and led much of the basic and applied soils research and graduate student training in Africa over the past 15 to 20 years. Data will be deposited and publically accessible at the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) website (www.africasoils.net/).",

From 2012 to 2016, we carried out 2,000+ field trials assessing fertilizer responses and improved management practices for maize and soyabean on 120 farms in Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Tanzania and Nigeria. We analyzed 500 soil and 1,000 plant samples for nutrient content, soil carbon, and other properties using standard methods, mid-infrared spectrometry and field methods. We determined mineralogy of bulk soil and clay fractions on 16 strategically selected samples. The project included a Masters student from each study area, and developed skills of eight field supervisors and a lab technician. Outcomes have been presented at science conferences and meetings and the first paper is being submitted for publication.</p>\n<p>The prevalence of non-responsiveness to inorganic inputs matched or exceeded earlier reports. Fertilizer inputs of 100kg N, 30kg P and 60kg K ha<sup>-1</sup> to maize, failed to increase maize grain yields by 1 ton ha<sup>-1</sup> in 24% of farm plots in Kenya, 46% in Tanzania, and &nbsp;74% and 79%, respectively, in DRCongo and Nigeria. For soyabean, inoculation with N-fixing <em>Rhizobia</em> and inputs of 30kg P and 40kg K ha<sup>-1</sup> failed to increase yields by 300 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> in 54% of the farms in Kenya, 61% in Tanzania, 30% in DRCongo and 91% in Nigeria. The prevalence of fertilizer non-responsiveness in maize and soyabean cropping emphasizes the major risks posed to ongoing initiatives for agricultural intensification throughout sub-Saharan Africa. An important finding is that the prevalence of non-responsiveness to inorganic fertilizer by maize and soyabean varied between study areas and among individual farmers within an area.

Results from on-farm trials put forward that fertilizer efficiency of maize and soyabean crops in tropical agro-ecosystems of Africa is impacted differently by soil mineralogy, texture and topography (slope). For maize, the abundance of 2:1 clays was identified as the most important driver of productivity and fertilizer responses, showing a positive relation due to the greater cation exchange capacity, inherent fertility and perhaps water retention. Silt content was the next factor explaining differences in fertilizer responses of maize crops followed by the amount of iron and aluminum oxides and slope. For soyabean, the silt content was the most important driver of productivity and fertilizer responses, separating the Nigeria study area from the others. The slope and amount of clay plus silt were the next factors explaining differences in fertilizer responses, followed by the amount of iron oxides in DRCongo study area. The Kenya study area results illustrate the difference in the effect of soil properties on crop production, with maize fertilizer responses negatively affected by lower soil pH, whereas for soyabean fertilizer responses were not, and even performed better in acid soils.
