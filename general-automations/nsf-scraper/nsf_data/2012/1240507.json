 "awd_abstract_narration": "Past fossil fuel use has conferred a complex mixture of benefits and risks on current and future generations. While enabling a tremendous growth in prosperity, the resulting greenhouse gas emissions may contribute to irreversible changes.  For example, the Greenland Ice Sheet might disintegrate in response to anthropogenic climate forcings.  The resulting sea-level rise would create serious risks for the sustainability of low-lying regions in the United States and beyond. Managing climate risks has already motivated local, national, and global actions: utilities replace coal-fired power plants with gas turbines, engineers design sea-walls for future climates, companies sequester carbon dioxide into geological reservoirs, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office has assessed possible geoengineering approaches.  These actions raise the question: what are sustainable, scientifically sound, technologically feasible, economically efficient, and ethically defensible climate-risk management strategies?  Answering this question is nontrivial for several reasons.  First, it transcends the traditional boundaries between academic disciplines as well as between academia, industry, government, and nongovernmental organizations.  Second, choosing a strategy involves complex trade-offs across a large range of temporal and spatial scales.  Third, this is a problem imbued with deep uncertainty where decisionmakers disagree about the appropriate problem framing, model structure, parameter values, and objectives.  Characterizing and representing this deep uncertainty is critical.  For example, analyses under different ethical frameworks can suggest strongly divergent strategies.  Current analyses of climate-risk management strategies have typically used integrated assessment models that link knowledge and tools from fields such as Earth system science, engineering, economics, decision analysis, operations research, and statistics.  These integrated assessments have broken important new ground, but they face severe limitations with respect to four interrelated research questions: (i) How large are the uncertainties? (ii) What might be actionable early warning signals?  (iii) What are the trade-offs between the diverse set of current and potential future objectives? (iv) What are the relevant value decisions and how do they affect the conclusions?  Analyzing these questions requires fundamental advances in the relevant disciplines, an effective, large-scale, and sustained network to link them together, a research-training program to educate the next generation of scientists and engineers, and an integration of stakeholders and decisionmakers within a process of shared discovery.  This research network on sustainable climate-risk management strategies will provide these advances and address these research questions.  \r\n\r\nThe research network will catalyze fundamental, mission-oriented, and transdisciplinary research to characterize the trade-offs associated with choosing among climate-risk management strategies and analyze how different sustainability criteria interact across a broad range of temporal and spatial scales.  More broadly, the network will (i) train the next generation of diverse scientists and engineers through an international and multi-institutional research, education and mentoring program, (ii) provide cyber-infrastructure to support transdisciplinary and computationally intensive research collaborations using high-performance computation, new models, and analysis tools that are accessible via a web interface, (iii) bring together experts across disciplines in workshops, (iv) integrate a diverse set of stakeholders and decisionmakers into the analyses, providing them with decision-relevant information, and (v) reach out to educators, decisionmakers, underrepresented groups, and the general public through cyber-infrastructure resources and interactive teaching materials.",

This approach provided new insights on how to refine decision analyses by, for example, revealing an additional approach to flood risk management in New Orleans (Bessette et al. 2017). In addition to the levee system, participants advocated for community resilience through improvements to transportation, education, and the police force.

For an example of managing coastal flood risks, we found that uncertainties surrounding storm surges and the Antarctic ice sheet are more important drivers of variations in projected flood risk than the uncertainties surrounding projections of the Greenland ice sheet dynamics (Figure 4). Climate sensitivity is a key parameter driving how aggressive abatement growth must be to robustly avoid more than two degrees Celsius of global warming (Lamontagne et al. 2019).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(3)&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Quantification of the current state of uncertainties and their possible future developments</span>.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nOverview: The Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) addressed the question: What are sustainable, scientifically sound, technologically feasible, economically efficient, and ethically defensible climate risk management strategies? SCRiM assembled a transdisciplinary team to support the required integration, tool development, innovation, and education (Figure 1).  \nSCRiM provided sizeable broader impacts such as:\n\n(1) Two K-12 workshops that trained 43 teachers from underserved districts in climate change science and strategies for communicating it.\n\n(2) Seven summer schools that trained 236 early-career researchers and practitioners in concepts, methods, and tools for analyzing and designing climate risk management strategies (Figure 2).\n\n(3) Five summer research experiences providing training and mentoring opportunities for 40 undergraduates and two graduate students representing 28 institutions (Figure 3).\n\n(4) Production and distribution of the PBS documentary Managing Risk in a Changing Climate. \n\n(5) Production and distribution of open-source tools (for example, how to identify robust strategies in the face of uncertainties) and teaching materials (for example, a free textbook on risk analysis), in addition to 165+ publications.\n\n(6) Co-support (stipend and/or tuition), mentoring, and training for 9 additional undergraduate researchers, 39 graduate students, and 25 postdoctoral researchers.\n\n \nIntellectual Merit: Examples of new insights enabled by SCRiM include:\n(1) Development and application of a new approach to jointly characterize the values and mental models of stakeholders, decision-makers, and analysts. This approach provided new insights on how to refine decision analyses by, for example, revealing an additional approach to flood risk management in New Orleans (Bessette et al. 2017). In addition to the levee system, participants advocated for community resilience through improvements to transportation, education, and the police force. These insights informed the design of new analyses.\n\n(2) Identification of which uncertainties matter most for the design of climate risk management strategies (Lamontagne et al. 2018, Wong and Keller 2017). For an example of managing coastal flood risks, we found that uncertainties surrounding storm surges and the Antarctic ice sheet are more important drivers of variations in projected flood risk than the uncertainties surrounding projections of the Greenland ice sheet dynamics (Figure 4). Climate sensitivity is a key parameter driving how aggressive abatement growth must be to robustly avoid more than two degrees Celsius of global warming (Lamontagne et al. 2019). \n\n(3) Quantification of the current state of uncertainties and their possible future developments. For example, the insight that the uncertainty surrounding storm surges strongly drives projected risks motivated refined analyses of how to reduce these uncertainties. We found that future observations can considerably reduce this uncertainty within decades (Lee et al. 2017).   \n\n(4) Quantification of trade-offs between objectives under deep uncertainty. We characterized, for example, the trade-off between abatement costs and the reliability of avoiding more than two degrees Celsius of global warming (Garner et al. 2016). We also analyzed the interactions of deeply uncertain societal and hydrologic factors to understand the robustness of infrastructure and the rules by which it is operated (Quinn et al. 2018).\nSCRiM provided transformative impacts for students, researchers, and the broader community. A key example is the careful and sustained integration of diverse disciplines such as engineering, statistics, applied ethics, social sciences, Earth sciences, and decision sciences (Figure 5). This approach helped to train a new generation of researchers and spawn new activities such as the NOAA Mid-Atlantic RISA (MARISA), the Penn State Initiative for Resilient Communities (PSIRC), and the Chesapeake Bay Coastal Climate Extension Program, all targeted at addressing local decision-support needs. \n \nReferences:\nBessette, DL, LA Mayer, B Cwik, M Vezer, K Keller, RJ Lempert, N Tuana (2017): Building a values-informed mental model for New Orleans climate risk management.
