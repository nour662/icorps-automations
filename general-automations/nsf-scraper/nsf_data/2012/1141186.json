 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a partnership among industry, the local community, and Drexel University with the goal to design and implement a Biomechanical Engineering curriculum that enables students to translate research results into commercially viable products. Building on the successes of the Gateway Coalition and the VaNTH Engineering Research Center, the project begins at the junior level, carries through to graduation and incorporates problem-based learning, cooperative education and entrepreneurial training. Faculty researchers, through the partnership, are assisting students as they learn to turn research results into products. \r\n\r\nThe project goal is being met by modifying existing junior level courses into a problem-based format, integrating cooperative education into the curriculum, and using Biomechanical Engineering faculty expertise to deliver the innovative classroom techniques. \r\n\r\nThe project evaluation is assessing benefits to students, faculty and co-op partners and consists of short and long term data collection and analysis. New understanding generated in the program will be widely disseminated and tested at local schools consisting of Lehigh University, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Rochester Polytechnic Institute and Olin College.",
