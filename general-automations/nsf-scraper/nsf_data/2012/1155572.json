The database will cover the entire US population with full geographic detail, providing contextual information on childhood neighborhood characteristics and labor-market conditions.  The project is funded collaboratively by the Minnesota Population Center with the nation?s largest producer of genealogical data, and it receives funding from the Census Bureau, the National Archives and Records Administration, in addition to the NSF. This collaboration allows a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources for shared infrastructure for social and behavioral research.  The component funded by the National Science Foundation involves digitizing the supplemental 1940 Census questions, including the parental birthplaces, veteran status, Social Security enrollment, occupation, marital status, number of children born, and other information collected for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe project involves (1) transcription of data describing the demographic and economic characteristics of individuals, families, households, and group quarters present in the United States; and (2) evaluation of data quality through random blind verification and comparison with published census returns. The outcome of the project will be a raw data file providing a transcription of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the 1940 population of the United States.  Researchers will be able to link Census data to e.g., panel surveys, administrative records, and the national death index, allowing study of the impact of early life conditions on later outcomes. The database will also enable innovative multi-level spatial analysis impossible to conduct until now. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis Census database seeks to enhance scientific and public understanding of critical policy-related issues, such as population aging, migration, economic mobility, and the impact of government policy on economic development and well-being. The new database will make a permanent and substantial addition to the country's statistical infrastructure, serving as a foundational reference collection with potentially far-reaching implications for research across the social and behavioral sciences. The project will also offer substantial research training to undergraduate and graduate students.",

The 1940 census offers the most detailed information on the American population that has ever been available, recording dozens of personal and household characteristics for 132 million people.  But in the form it was released, as millions of scanned images, there was no way to analyze this trove of information.  Accordingly, in a unique partnership, the Minnesota Population Center (MPC) joined with the genealogical company Ancestry.com to convert these images to a format suitable for scientific research.  Ancestry transcribed the census responses from the forms, and MPC converted the transcriptions into numerically coded data and disseminates them through the IPUMS data access system.  The National Science Foundation grant specifically funded key socio-economic questions that Ancestry would not otherwise have entered, because they are not useful for their genealogy search tools.\n\nThe project succeeded in producing a full 1940 census dataset in 2015 and made it publicly available at http://usa.ipums.org.  Among other features, the new database provides the earliest information available on educational attainment, migration, labor force status, and wage and salary income.
