 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although it is widely accepted that speciation is a gradual and constant process with no clear boundaries for the identification of species, to our knowledge, no study has empirically evaluated the accumulation of species properties across time scales or from a comparative phylogenetic perspective. The research objective of this study is to evaluate the order and magnitude of change in species properties over time in the mostly South American plant genus Bartsia L. - a group of closely related species that show varying degrees of morphological, ecological, and geographical differentiation, but for which the evolutionary relationships are as of yet, unknown. To accomplish this objective, the proposed work includes, 1) a rigorous assessment of species delimitation using multiple lines of evidence including molecular, morphological, ecological, and geographical information, 2) the reconstruction of a well-resolved species phylogeny, and 3) an evolutionary comparative analysis of the accumulation of the inherent properties of a species. In addition, the resulting robust phylogenetic hypothesis for the South American species of Bartsia will provide the necessary framework for future comparative ecological and evolutionary studies in this group.\r\n\r\nThe p\u00e1ramo is considered one of the most biodiverse montane ecosystems in the world and a more thorough understanding of p\u00e1ramo biodiversity is essential for the development of effective conservation strategies for this ecologically important and fragile Andean ecosystem.  To actively aid in the conservation of the p\u00e1ramo we will engage in several lectures about patterns of biodiversity in the Andes sponsored and coordinated by collaborating institutions in Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia.",

Evolutionary biologists studying patterns of biodiversity use these characteristics to describe species and quantify biodiversity, as well as to study the process of speciation. As part of the Co-PI&rsquo;s dissertation research at the University of Idaho, we were interested in studying the accumulation of these characteristics in the plant genus <em>Bartsia</em>, a member of the parasitic plant family Orobanchaceae. This group has approximately 45 species that grow above 13,000 ft., mostly in alpine ecosystems in South America. Specifically, we wanted to determine how the 45 species of <em>Bartsia </em>were related to each other, and use these evolutionary relationships as a basis for 1) understanding the origin of this diversity in Andean South America, 2) determining what traits were important for speciation in the group, and 3) updating the classification of the genus.</p>\n<p>Using numerous samples collected by the Co-PI from throughout the range (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia), representing the morphological, geographic, and genetic diversity of all species of <em>Bartsia</em>, we used genetic (DNA sequence) data to determine the pattern of evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) of the group. However, to accomplish this, it was first necessary to develop new approaches for collecting the datasets necessary for elucidating the phylogeny of this group of closely related species. Advances in sequencing technologies &ndash; specifically high throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) &ndash; have made the creation of larger datasets possible, and this project was designed with that in mind. Although molecular systematics has benefited greatly with the advancements of HTS, all of the approaches that were being used for phylogenetic studies produce excessive amounts of uninformative data that is not suitable for phylogenetic systematics. Motivated by this, we developed a new approach to generate large amounts of data efficiently and affordably, but&mdash;most importantly&mdash; done in a way that we could decide which parts of the genome to sequence (i.e., targeted). To do this, we relied on the proven specificity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a method that selects and makes large amounts of copies of single regions in the genome. Traditionally, PCR is performed one region at a time, but taking advantage of newly available microfluidic technology, we were able to amplify 48 separate, targeted regions for 48 independent samples simultaneously, and sequence these using HTS technologies. We believe that by using targeted HTS approaches, systematists and evolutionary biologists can maximize the data that they can collect by decreasing the number of regions in the genomes that they choose and increasing the number of samples per run.
