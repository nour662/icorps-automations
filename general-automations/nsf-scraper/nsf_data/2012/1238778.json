 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tennessee State University HBCU-UP Broadening Participation Research in STEM Education project is entitled Career Commitment and Retention in STEM: Building the STEM Workforce.  The proposed effort is a collaboration among faculty in the College of Education; College of Engineering; and College of Agriculture, Human and Natural Resources. The goal is to expand the current theory on effective career development and management interventions for minority STEM students. The study will examine the impact of a research- and theory-based intervention to develop career management skills on commitment to, engagement and retention in, graduation from, and engagement in STEM post graduate study and careers. The PIs hope to provide evidence of the additive impact of specific training in career development and management for minority students at minority-serving institutions using theory- and research-based culturally competent career management interventions. \r\n\r\nMore specifically, the proposed project is designed to determine whether a research- and theory-based intervention to promote the development of career management skills among minority STEM undergraduates will increase (a) career planning and management skills and knowledge over that developed through existing STEM professional development activities; (b) commitment to and interest, performance, retention, and professional engagement in STEM careers; and (c) participation in professional organizations, volunteer research, internships, field experiences, conferences, and publishing needed for obtaining entrance to graduate programs and high quality employment.  The project is designed to determine also whether participation in such interventions will decrease time to graduation. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project responds to the need for minority students to have realistic expectations about STEM career pathways and concrete professional development plans. The dynamic nature of STEM careers requires students to keep abreast of changing skill requirements. The proposed project will provide STEM majors with increased confidence in their commitment to a STEM career and enable them to develop clear plans for matriculating through undergraduate study and beyond.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe HBCU-UP BPR Career Commitment and Retention in STEM grant was developed to pilot test a culturally-appropriate workshop for African American STEM majors.  This interdisciplinary project was led by a Vocational Psychologist and representatives from the Colleges of Education, Engineering, as well as Agricultural, Human &amp; Natural Sciences, encompassing the STEM fields of Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, Plant &amp; Soil Sciences, and Psychology.\n\nSocial Cognitive Career Theory (Lent, Brown, &amp; Hackett, 1996; Lent, 20013) provided the model undergirding the research, with recent meta-analytic work on the effectiveness of career development interventions (Brown &amp; Krane, 2000; Brown et al., 2003) and the Culturally-Appropriate Career Counseling Model (Fouad &amp; Bingham, 1995) grounded the development of the intervention.  780 African America STEM majors from an Historically Black, Land Grant University participated in the study, which examined the effect of a research-based career development workshop as compared to a control group who did not receive the intervention.\n\nSix major outcomes resulted from this study.  First, an adaptation of the SCCT measures to include non-engineering STEM majors was validated.  Second, these SCCT measures were validated on an African American STEM student sample (as opposed to a diverse sample).  Third, the workshop resulted in the participants developing 10-year plans to achieve their STEM career goals.  Fourth, the control group's commitment to and intent to persist in ther STEM major was observed to not change over the course of a 16-week semester.  This suggests that typical services and programs for university students are not having an effect on STEM student commitment and retention.  Fifth, the intervention developed through this funding produced changes in students' awareness of both barriers  and supports to reaching their STEM career goals.  Thus, greater awareness of supports to minimize the impact of barriers is considered to be a coping mechanism to enhance retention.  Finally, to date, the project has completed 15 peer-reviewed conference presentations, with a dissertation and five manuscripts in process.\n\nBased upon these outcomes, further study to refine the workshop in order to increase its effectiveness is warranted.  In addition, furhter research on African American STEM student career development needs and skills is warranted to enable greater effectiveness in policy- and decision-Making in order to support these students' commitment to and retention in their STEM career paths.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/17/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marie S Hammond"
