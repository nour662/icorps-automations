 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award to North Dakota State University funds acquisition of an imaging system to examine relatively small items up to 12 inches and 25 pounds using digital radiography and computed X-ray microtomography (microCT).  In addition to producing high-resolution conventional two-dimensional/flat radiographs, the system uses microCT to form multiple cross-sectional digital images of an object along a single axis.  These images can be reassembled and manipulated graphically to create a three-dimensional virtual model, permitting inspection of external and internal structures without damage to the original object.  There are many possibilities for subsequent analysis of the virtual model, e.g. visualization of computer-generated ?slices?, arbitrary sectional views in any desired plane, pseudo-color representations of different phases, and pore analysis.  Accurate internal measurements can be made that are obtainable in no other way without destroying the sample. MicroCT provides a unique nondestructive way to visualize complex structures from the macro to micro scales.  Overall system resolution now is better than 1 \u00b5m, permitting detailed understanding of characteristics of structure, composition, phase morphology, and particle distribution.  Also included for specimen prep\u00aca\u00acra\u00action is a lyophilizer or freeze-drying apparatus to remove water by sublimation and desorption, thus preserving perishable samples for imaging.  Instrumentation will be housed in the NDSU Electron Microscopy Center, making it universally available for analysis to researchers in fields from Biology and Anthropology to Engineering and Chemistry as well as for teaching/training across disciplines.\r\n\r\nThrough microCT, investigators will have access to nondestructive analysis that is simply impossible at NDSU now.  This active, well-funded research team, which is ethnically and gender-diverse, encourages participation by members of groups that traditionally have not been not well-represented in the scientific community (e.g., women, Native Americans).  In addition to research use, microCT will be an integral part of courses on nanotechnology, nanomaterials, characterization, and materials-design physics; that training will broaden career opportunities for NDSU graduates and help attract talented new faculty members.  The instrumentation is expected to see immediate use as a teaching tool for inspection in Bison Microventure, an ongoing multidisciplinary course that over the past three years has provided hands-on experience integrating biology, chemistry, and engineering for undergraduate and graduate students representing eight majors from five colleges.  With its versatility and ready visualization, microCT will be an attractive option for undergraduate Biotechnology students and K-20 students participating in NDSU outreach programs like the North Dakota Governor's School, NATURE program (Nurturing American Tribal Undergraduate Research and Education), state Science Olympiad, and local education collaborations.  Other anticipated users include institutions throughout the North Dakota University System and industry partners across the upper Midwestern region, as no other microCT units are available within the state.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe funded instrument, the GE Inspection Technologies v|tome|x s 240kV microfocus X-ray computed tomography (microCT) system, has been a popular and widely used addition to the Electron Microscopy Center at North Dakota State University.

This type of non&shy;destruc&shy;tive testing has wide-ranging research and commercial applications.\n\n Intellectual Merit.  Since its installation in July 2013, more than 700 microCT scans have been per&shy;formed for 43 NDSU scientists in 14 different departments representing five academic colleges.  At least six doctoral graduate students are incorporating microCT data into their dissertation work.  Eleven letters of support or collaboration have been provided to NDSU constituents applying for research grant funding that would involve the microCT.  Other researchers not affiliated with NDSU (including Clemson University, Sonoma State University, University of North Dakota, USDA, and area industry partners) also have used the unique nondestructive-inspection capabilities of the microCT to support their projects.  The recent addition of a 3D printer that can pro&shy;duce solid objects using shareable files generated from microCT scans will further enable visuali&shy;za&shy;tion and modeling. \n\nBroader Impacts.  Operation of the microCT was taught to students participating in NATURE (Nurturing American Tribal Undergraduate Research and Education), a two-week camp for American Indian stu&shy;dents from North Dakota tribal colleges and reservation high schools with the goal of increasing Ameri&shy;can Indian high school graduation rates and to encourage students to pursue STEM fields in college by tying culture to the sciences.  During the camp, participants worked with NDSU and University of North Dakota personnel on research projects in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields; a student group completed and presented a project utilizing the microCT to look inside familiar objects.\n\nLocation of this versatile instrument in a core facility where universal access and collaboration are tenets represents ulti&shy;mate efficiency and responsible stewardship of state and federal public funds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jayma A Moore"
