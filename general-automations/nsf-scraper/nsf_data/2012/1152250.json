 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Frank E. Osterloh from the University of California at Davis will attempt to convert inexpensive and stable first row transition metal oxides into effective photocatalysts for splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen fuel. Even though many known materials absorb visible light strongly, they are not being utilized for photochemical water splitting because photochemical charge carriers are short lived, charge transport is slow, and because of large overpotentials for water reduction or oxidation. In this research these problems will be addressed by nanoscaling the materials and by modifying the surfaces of the particles using chemical processes that will improve reactivity. Advanced measurements on the nano-metal oxides will be conducted to obtain new insight into the relationship between particle size, electronic properties, and photocatalytic activity. \r\n\r\nThe water splitting reaction has long been considered as a possible method to generate fuel from solar energy. Here, light is used to excite a material to produce a photovoltage. That voltage can then be used to electrolyze (cleave) water into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is an energy-rich molecule that can serve as a versatile fuel for transportation, or to generate electricity and other high value chemicals. Because sunlight is used as energy source for making the hydrogen, no fossil fuels are used up and no carbon dioxide is produced that would contribute to climate change. Today, solar water splitting is limited by the lack of materials that have the desired reactivity and absorb visible light, and that are chemically stable, abundant, and cheap enough for large scale application of this technology. This project will attempt to develop transition metal oxides as catalysts for the process. These oxides have been shown to combine several promising properties, and they are cheap and abundant. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of the project. The students will receive training in solar energy conversion and materials science. Chemical demonstrations will also be developed to educate the public about the importance of solar energy conversion.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, Frank Osterloh at the University of California at Davis directed several graduate, postgraduate, and undergraduate students to identify catalytic materials that can turn water into hydrogen using sunlight illumination as the only energy input.  The hydrogen from this photocatalytic \u00e6water splitting\u00c6 or artificial photosynthesis reaction is desired as an alternative to fossil fuels.  Hydrogen burns cleanly without producing carbon dioxide and without contributing to climate change.  The project focuses on catalysts made from inexpensive metal oxide materials.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe ability of small inorganic particles to generate hydrogen from water under illumination with light is limited by a poor understanding of photochemical charge separation at the particle interfaces.  Several parallel studies in this project were directed at this issue.   In one study, sub-micrometer particles of a rhodium-modified strontium titanium oxide were synthesized, and their charge transfer properties measured with surface photovoltage spectroscopy.  It was found that the photovoltage depends on the distance between light absorber and charge acceptor, the electrochemical potentials of donor and acceptor, and on the reversibility of the redox processes. This data was used to guide the fabrication of a powder-based device for hydrogen production from water and potassium ferrocyanide.  For hematite, a derivative of rust, it was found that visible light illumination produces photovoltages between 0.13 and 0.4 V that can be used for the oxidation of small molecules. Hematite is of great interest as an inexpensive light absorber material for solar energy conversion.  In another study, dissolved ions in water were found to affect the ability of small light absorbing particles to oxidize or reduce water under illumination.  For example, positive ions adsorb to the light absorber particles to charge them positively and to generate a positive voltage bias that affects charge transfer.  Furthermore, the linkage of cobalt oxide to bismuth vanadium oxide particles yielded a photocatalyst for water oxidation with 10% photon efficiency.  Water oxidation is a necessary step for generating hydrogen fuel from water.  For another metal oxide, tungsten oxide, it was shown that smaller particle size allows faster extraction of electrons and positive charge.  This speeds up the water oxidation reaction, but at the same time it makes it more difficult to separate the charge carriers and generate a voltage.   Overall, the discoveries in this project will help build the next generation of catalysts for solar water splitting and for artificial photosynthesis of hydrogen.  \n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe project also helped train three post-graduate students, twelve graduate and six undergraduate students in the preparation of inorganic materials for solar energy conversion. The students prepared and investigated the metal oxides with several techniques to determine their ability to absorb light, produce voltage, and hydrogen or oxygen.  The work generated four Ph.D. dissertations, one Master\u00c6s thesis, over ten presentations at conferences, and twelve publications in scientific journals.
