 "awd_abstract_narration": "1214122 (Mosher).  Direct Potable Reuse (DPR) is the planned introduction of recycled water directly into a public water system or into a raw water supply upstream of a water treatment plant. DPR has the potential to provide a reliable, sustainable local water supply; however, it is not easily implementable in the U.S. due to scientific/technical knowledge gaps and public perception. This multi-disciplinary workshop will bring together academics and water professionals to focus on the technical and social challenges and either directly address them or prepare guidance on means to address them. The workshop will include review of background papers, working group sessions, group report development, and presentations of group reports. A final report will be accessible online. The workshop will advance knowledge in public perception (social science) and technical issues (engineering). The public perception outcomes will directly enhance outreach and educational activities in the water industry. The technology outcomes will enhance scientific research and engineering applications by identifying key issues that will allow for the implementation of DPR and improve current water treatment technologies.   DPR has the potential to significantly improve and diversify sustainable water resources management throughout the US, especially in arid regions like CA, AZ, and TX. It can reduce the need for long-distance water conveyance (and associated energy consumption). DPR implementation can also encourage the transformative view that wastewater is a renewable recoverable source of energy, nutrients, and potable water. The final product, a workshop report, will provide guidance on developing protocols for addressing technical challenges to DPR (e.g., modifications needed to upgrade existing advanced treatment facilities to DPR). It will also provide outreach/education tools to better communicate and increase the public?s understanding of DPR. The workshop report will be disseminated broadly to the water community as a free internet download for the purpose of enhancing the scientific and technical understanding of methods/facilities needed to undertake DPR projects, as well as enhance the understanding of social aspects/activities needed to gain public acceptance of DPR. The workshop has the potential to help make DPR a viable option for communities seeking to augment/diversify potable water supplies. Some benefits of DPR to society at-large include: providing a water supply alternative for communities that lack groundwater aquifers or surface water; reducing wastewater discharge to the ocean or inland surface waters, reducing the extraction/depletion of water from aquifers and surface waters, and reducing energy use.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWorkshop on Evaluating Approaches for Implementing Direct Potable Reuse \n\n \n\nDirect potable reuse (DPR) is the planned introduction of purified recycled water directly into a public water system or raw water supply upstream of a drinking water treatment plant.  DPR is a new strategy to satisfy future water demands and develop more sustainable water supplies.  It differs from indirect potable reuse in that the environmental buffer (a groundwater aquifer or surface water resource) is eliminated. \n\n \n\nThe National Water Research Institute (NWRI) received funding from NSF to facilitate two workshops on \"Evaluating Approaches for Implementing Direct Potable Reuse\" to: \n\n \n\nProvide a forum to address technical and social/outreach challenges to DPR implementation and develop solutions and strategies.\nProduce workshop reports that advanced knowledge in the areas of public perception (outreach and education) and treatment technology (scientific research and engineering), as well as recommend next steps towards developing DPR protocols.\nDisseminate the workshop reports to researchers, academics, practitioners, regulators, policy makers, and others in the water community.\n\n\n \n\nWorkshop #1: Public Perception Workshop\n\n \n\nNWRI organized a workshop in February 2014 with over 30 participants to identify, review, and recommend outreach tools/tactics to help the water industry:\n\n \n\nBetter      communicate with stakeholders (decision makers, environmental groups, underrepresented      groups, etc.) regarding the need for and technology behind DPR.\nIncrease public awareness/knowledge      of potable reuse and DPR.\nAddress public      concerns in a proactive, transparent manner.\nBuild public      trust/confidence in the quality and safety of product water. \nReinforce the      value/benefits of DPR as a sustainable water supply.\n\n\n \n\nWorkshop findings included:\n\n \n\nPublic Trust in the Utility Is Important - The water utility should be a trusted      source of information. \n\n\nOur      Communications Can Create Anxiety -The public takes their cue from the way our      industry communicates to them. \n\n\nThe Disgust Factor Can Be Overcome - Being informed helps deter aversion to recycled      water. \n\n\nThe Public Has Different Concerns &ndash; Treatment technology and public health are      not always the main issues; the      public is often interested in the costs of potable reuse and alternatives.\n\n\nThe Right Terminology and Messages Are      Key - Outreach      should focus on water quality and safety rather than the source (i.e.,      wastewater). \n\n\nAgencies Must Have Active Outreach - Outreach should be sustained.  A key tool in maintaining outreach is a      demonstration facility or visitors center.\n\n\nVideos Are Powerful Tools - Turn technical information into short,      entertaining videos to share with the public. \n\n\n \n\nWorkshop #2: Treatment Workshop\n\n \n\nNWRI organized a workshop in July 2014 with 33 participants to focus on defining the level of treatment and resulting water quality required to make wastewater an acceptable raw water supply ahead of a conventional drinking water treatment plant.  Objectives included:\n\n \n\nReview      available state and national criteria/guidelines for potable reuse.\nReview      relevant ongoing research.\nEvaluate      the level of treatment required to meet a raw water standard, based upon      pathogen and pollutant risk. \nBrainstorm      impacts of the level of reclaimed water treatment and level of blending of      reclaimed water with other raw water supplies on downstream drinking water      treatment.\n\n\n \n\nWorkshop findings included:\n\n \n\nWastewater Management and Optimization \n\nEnhance source control.\nAccount for variation in operating wastewater treatment plants.\nStrengthen requirements of wastewater treatment plants.\n\n\nAdvanced Water Treatment and Monitoring \n\nRecognize variation exists in operation of unit processes.\nBuild redundancy in the treatment system.\nAddress chemicals of concern.\nAssess ..."
