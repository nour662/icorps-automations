 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will pursue several lines of research in algebraic geometry involving the application of combinatorial and nonarchimedean methods to study algebraic curves and their moduli, plus intersection theory.  In particular, he will investigate nonarchimedean approaches to the Gieseker-Petri Theorem and Maximal Rank Conjectures, the weight filtration on cohomology of moduli of curves, and the development of a functorial tropicalization of intersection theory. Into this research program, the PI will integrate an educational program that will include supporting undergraduates as research assistants on carefully selected projects in tropical geometry and working to increase the participation of graduate students and recent PhDs from US institutions in the annual GAeL conference for early career algebraic geometers.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry studies solution sets of systems of polynomial equations.  Over a nonarchimedean field, one can split the problem of understanding such a solution set into two parts.  What are the possible valuations of solutions?  And what are the solutions with a given valuation?  The set of valuations of solutions has a rich combinatorial and polyhedral structure, and is the primary object of study in tropical geometry.  Recent developments in this field make it possible to resolve subtle questions about the geometry of the actual solution set using the geometry of these sets of valuations. This award supports efforts to refine these new methods and explore deeper applications to open problems in algebraic geometry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMajor research goals of the project involve the develpment of rigorous links between tropical and nonarchimedean analytic geometry, and the use of such links to address questions of classical and current interest in algebraic geometry.  Specific problems to be considered include linear series on general curves, the topology of moduli spaces of curves, and tropicalization of intersection theory in compact spaces.  Educational goals of the project include the development of a program for undergraduate reseach in mathematics at Yale, ongoing support for Yale Splash educational outreach activities, the inclusion of participants from US based institutions in the Geometrie Algebrique en Liberte (GAeL) conferences, and mentoring graduate students and postdocs working in areas related to tropical geometry.\nI will describe two significant results about the algebraic geometry and topology of moduli spaces of curves, contributing to the intellectual merit of this project, proved using tropical and nonarchimedean analytic methods.\nOne significant result from this project are the proof that M_22 and M_23 are of general type.  This new result on the geometry is accomplished by studying the multiplication maps on linear series of fixed degree and rank on a general curve, using tropical and nonarchimedean analytic methods (joint with Dave Jensen).\nAnother significant result is the proof that the dimension of the rational cohomology group H^{4g-4}(M_g) grows exponentially with g.  This new result on the topology of M_g refutes an old conjecture of Kontsevich, from his 1993 paper on formal symplectic geometry, and a more recent conjecture from topology and geometric group theory by Church, Farb, and Putman.  The key new insight comes from using the topology of the tropical moduli space of curves, which is also the skeleton of the nonarchimedean analytification of M_g associated to the Deligne-Mumford compactification.\nThe educational components of the project provide broader impacts by fostering cooperating and mutual understanding between early career mathematicians in the US and their peers and colleagues in Europe and elsewhere in the world.  The SUMRY undergraduate research program at Yale also provides extensive opportunities for talented and interested undergraduates to get a taste of research, and take first steps toward a possible career in mathematics.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/18/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sam Payne"
