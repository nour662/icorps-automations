The goals of this project are to design networking tools for mobile underwater networks, develop novel navigation mechanisms for communication-constrained autonomous underwater vehicles and to ultimately integrate sensing and classification to provide solutions for the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.\r\n\r\nThis project will lead to development of underwater communication methods with applications to science, security, and industry in the areas of environmental monitoring, aquatic eco-system analysis, ocean accident remediation, surveillance for defense applications, homeland security, oil and gas, aquaculture, geological and oceanographic science, and marine biology. It will also contribute to the training of new information technology professionals and scientists with expertise in interdisciplinary research spanning underwater networks, oceanography and computer science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur major objective in this project was to enhance the capabilities of ocean observing systems and networks, through application of advanced algorithms.  A common theme in the work has been the extraordinary constraints placed on coordinated multi-vehicle systems by acoustic-only communication; acoustic communications are usually slow, lossy, power-hungry, and subject to interference.  Because of this situation and other realities of the ocean environment, marine robots tend to be conservatively operated today.  On the other hand, there is great scientific and societal need for improved ocean observing infrastructure, and thus operational limits have to be addressed head-on.\n\nConsidering highly dynamic vehicle systems that are subject to communication losses, a fundamental analysis can easily identify oscillatory behavior and elucidate certain design trade-offs, but controller synthesis given a communication network is much harder, and the so-called co-design problem (i.e., of a network and its controller) harder still.  In these directions, we first built a multi-vehicle system to perform acoustic-only localization and pursuit of a moving target, as might be used to follow a marine animal.  This is among the most aggressive tasks that a communication-constrained system could undertake, and we were able to demonstrate dynamic performance about five times faster than in any other published work.  Motivated by those experiments, we developed in 2014-15 a more comprehensive design tool that accommodates a broad range of communication schedules, and includes the possibility of severe packet loss.  One highlight is that we are now able to quantititatively account for the scenario of delayed lossy acknowledgement packets, a practical concern that has not seen attention in the literature to date. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/15/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Franz S Hover"
