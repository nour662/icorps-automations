 "awd_abstract_narration": "Linguists studying endangered languages in the field often ask their informants to describe pictures that illustrate particular characteristics of their language, such as how it uses pronouns or spatial relations or concepts of time.  This enables the field linguist to obtain natural language with minimal instruction, exercising minimal influence on what is said, so that accurate information about the language can be recorded.  Typically such pictures are prepared in advance, based upon research hypotheses about the language -- but often new hypotheses emerge in the course of sessions with informants.  Researchers at Columbia University have proposed to develop an aid to field linguists which makes it possible to test new research questions as they arise in the field.   They will adapt existing text-to-scene generation software, WordsEye, which allows users to create 3D scenes from simple English input, to produce a novel tool for fieldwork called WELT, the WordsEye Linguistics Tool.\r\n\r\nWELT tool will ultimately have two modes of operation:  1) In Phase 1, English input will automatically generate a picture which can be used to elicit a targeted description, 2) In Phase 2, input in the target language will automatically generate a picture representing the meaning of the input, to verify linguistic hypotheses with native speakers. \r\n\r\nWhile WELT is intended ultimately for general use, it will initially be developed to study Arrernte, an endangered language spoken by ~6000-8000 Arrernte people in Central Australia.  While some aspects of this language are well documented, a number of idiosyncratic lexical and morphological features of the language that relate to describing spatial relations are not well understood.  Such features are interesting because they relate directly to how a language is used by its speakers to describe the way their perceive the world.  The language group's remote location and insular culture have made it difficult to document by traditional means, so that tools such as WELT should be particularly useful.  WELT will be tested in the field as part of an existing cooperation with Dr. Mark Dras and other researchers at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.\r\nThe Division of Information & Intelligent Systems of the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering is [co-]funding this award as part of its commitment to support the development of computational tools and methods for the documentation of endangered languages.",

We implemented an  algorithm for learning a dependency parser and ran experiments to see  (a) how successfully we could learn a parser from limited examples and  (b) which machine learning techniques were most successful.  We found  that this method performed very well across all six languages,  outperforming the baseline even when trained on fewer than ten labeled  sentences.

Saving endangered languages not only helps to preserve people's cultures but it provides ways that new generations can explore the languages of their ancestors and motivates them to learn and use those languages.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julia B Hirschberg"
