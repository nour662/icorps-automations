 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Kevin H. Miller of the University of Florida to conduct a research project, entitled \"Infrared Transmission Study of Electric and Magnetic Excitations in Novel Single Crystals\" during the summer of 2012 at the University of Wollongong in Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia.  The host scientist is Professor Roger A. Lewis.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in searching for magnon and electromagnon excitations in novel multiferroic and magnetoelectric single crystals.  More specifically, the proposed research involveds terahertz transmission measurements on FeTe2O5Br, CuSe2O5, and Cu3Bi(SeO3)2O2Cl to investigate the existence of magnetoelectric coupling in these materials.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
