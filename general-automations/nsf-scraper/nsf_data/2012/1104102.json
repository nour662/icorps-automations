 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1934, Reinhardt considered the problem of determining the shape of the centrally symmetric convex disk in the plane whose densest packing has the lowest density.  In informal terms, if a contract requires a miser to make payment with a tray of identical gold coins filling the tray as densely as possible, and if the contract stipulates the coins to be convex and centrally symmetric, then what shape of coin should the miser choose in order to part with as little gold as possible?  Reinhardt conjectured that the shape of the coin should be a smoothed octagon.  The smoothed octagon is constructed by taking a regular octagon and clipping the corners with hyperbolic arcs.  The density of the smoothed octagon is approximately 90 per cent.  Work by previous researchers on this conjecture has tended to focus on special cases. Research of the PI gives a general analysis of the problem.  It introduces a variational problem on the special linear group in two variables that captures the structure of the Reinhardt conjecture.  An interesting feature of this problem is that the conjectured solution is not analytic, but only satisfies a Lipschitz condition.  A second noteworthy feature of this problem is the presence of a nonlinear optimization problem in a finite number of variables, relating smoothed polygons to the conjecturally optimal smoothed octagon.  The PI has previously completed many calculations related to the proof of the Reinhardt conjecture and proposes to complete the proof of the Reinhardt conjecture.\r\n\r\nThis research will solve a conjecture made in 1934 by Reinhardt about  the convex shape in the plane whose optimal packing density is as small  as possible. The significance of this proposal is found in its broader  context.  Here, three important fields of mathematical inquiry are  brought to bear on a single problem: discrete geometry, nonsmooth  variational analysis, and global nonlinear optimization.  Problems concerning packings and density lie at the heart of discrete geometry  and are closely connected with problems of the same nature that  routinely arise in materials science.  Variational problems and more  generally control theory are have become indispensable tools in many  disciplines, ranging from mathematical finance to robotic control.   However, research that gives an exact nonsmooth solution is relatively  rare, and this feature gives this project special interest among  variational problem.  This research is also expected to further develop  methods that use computers to obtain exact global solutions to nonlinear  optimization problems.  Applications of nonlinear optimization are  abundant throughout science and arise naturally whenever a best choice  is sought among a system with finitely many parameters.  Methods that  use computers to find exact solutions thus have the potential of finding  widespread use.  Thus, by studying this particular packing problem,  mathematical tools may be further developed with promising prospects of  broad application throughout the sciences.",
