 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematical Sciences at Tennessee State University has as its goal to develop and implement an applied mathematics program, which is designed to fill the gap between mathematics and other STEM areas.  This will be achieved using a set of strategically constructed interventions that include, but are not limited to development of new courses and curricula related to applied mathematics, institutionalization of a new concentration in applied mathematics for undergraduate mathematics majors and enhancement of research experiences.  Collectively, these strategies are expected to increase the overall number of mathematics majors at the institution by 10%, and build the science capacity and infrastructure of the institution such that the mathematical and technological skills of the entire undergraduate population are enhanced.  As such, Tennessee State University is uniquely poised to contribute to diversifying the US STEM workforce.",
