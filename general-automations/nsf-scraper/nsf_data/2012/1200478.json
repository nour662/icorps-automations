 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary research aim  of this project is to study the interplay between topology, geometry and combinatorics.  Three areas  will receive special emphasis: triangulations of compact manifolds (with and without boundary) and closely related spaces,  finite linear quotients of spheres, and matroids.     Compact manifolds are one of the cornerstones of modern mathematics and physics.   In the last century a tremendous amount of research has been directed toward unlocking their topology and geometry.  However, questions of a combinatorial character have remained largely unanswered. What is the minimum number of  facets  required to triangulate a given manifold? How do various  topological invariants  determine how complicated it is to represent the manifold on a computer?  What methods are there to construct manifolds with particular combinatorial properties?   Conversely, given limits on the combinatorics of a triangulation, what does that imply about the possible geometries on the manifold?   Similar questions, where even less is known, apply to spaces with singularities which include algebraic varieties, quotients of group actions, or limits of Riemannian manifolds.  Finite linear quotients of spheres lie at the intersection of representation theory, topology, geometry and combinatorics.   How are the topology and geometry of the quotient space related to the combinatorics and algebra of the representation theoretic data?  Matroids are a combinatorial abstraction of linear independence with a variety of applications including hyperplane arrangements, linear optimization, reliability, order restricted statistical inference, and the aforementioned linear quotients of spheres. The project will concentrate on enumerative properties of matroids.  The questions above are representative of the research that will be conducted by the PI during the project.\r\n\r\n How does one study complicated spaces and structures? One approach is to approximate them with simpler objects. For instance, an n-dimensional object might be represented as a collection of n-simplices - the higher dimensional analogues of triangles and tetrahedrons. How complicated are these representations? How many of the smaller pieces are needed? How is this reflected in the shape and geometry of the original object? Are there computationally practical ways of producing these models? These are types of questions addressed in this research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary scientific goal of the project was to investigate, discover  and understand the relationships between the combinatorial, geometric and topological properties of various mathematical structures and spaces.  For instance, if you want to construct a shape using triangles which looks like the outside of a donut, a topological property,  you must use at least 14 triangles, a combinatorial property.   Below are some details of the results of the project. \n\n \n\nManifolds and pseudomanifolds are two important types of spaces in mathematics and physics as they are frequently the solutions to the equations encountered in both fields.   One very concrete way of constructing such spaces is to use simplices.  Line segments (usually called edges), triangles and tetrahedra are 1-, 2- and 3- dimensional simplices respectively.  There are analogs of these shapes in every dimension.  Putting simplices together in a structured way gives us a simplicial complex.  These simiplicial complexes represent the spaces we are interested in.  It also turns out that simplicial complexes are relatively straightforward  to compute with.  The basic question we ask is, if the space represented by the simplicial complex has certain topological or geometric properties how many simplices in each dimension will we need? More intuitively, if a space has a complicated shape how many and what kind of building blocks will we need to build it?  \n\n \n\nThe most important manifold is probably the n-dimensional sphere.  During the time of this project a reasonable argument could be made that determining all possible f-vectors of spheres was the most important problem in the subject.   The f-vector of a simplicial complex is a list of the number of siimplices in the complex in each dimension. The main question is whether something called the g-conjecture is true.  The g-conjecture states that all possible f-vectors of simplicial complexes which are spheres is the same all possible f-vectors of the boundaries of simplicial polytopes.  Boundaries of simplicial polytopes are very special spheres and represent only a tiny fraction of all possible spheres.  One result of the project was to verify the g-conjecture when there were not too many edges compared to the number of vertices.  Another result of the project was a sharp upper bound on the number of triangles in terms of the first homology group, then number of vertices and the number of edges when the simplicial complex is a manifold.  The first homology group is a topological invariant which can be thought of as  measuring the number of 1-dimensional holes in the space.  \n\n \n\nA three-dimensional manifold is a space which locally looks like the three-dimensional space we are all familiar with.  A close cousin of simplicial complexes is a crystallization.  It is like a simplicial complex except that we allow more than one edge between 2 vertices, more than one triangle between three edges, etc.  A minimal crystallization of a three-dimensional manifold has exactly four vertices.  A reasonable measure of the complexity of a three-dimensional manifold is the smallest number of edges required in a minimal crystallization of the manifold.  The project produced an infinite family of irreducible three-dimensional manifolds where the least number of edges needed in a minimal crystallization was determined.  \n\n \n\nIn a different direction the project produced a complete catalog of all possible normal three-dimensional pseudomanifolds with 10 vertices.  A three-dimensional normal pseudo manifold is (more or less) a space that locally looks like three-dimensional space except possibly at a finite number of points.  The points where the space does not look like three-dimensional space are called singular points.  The catalog has millions of new examples and over a thousand different distinct types of spaces.  In addition, an analysis of many of these examples led to the discovery of a variety of new connections between the f-vector of a 3-dimensional pseudomanifold and the topology near its singular points.  \n\n \n\nThe broader impact of the project involved the training of future researchers in topological and geometric combinatorics.  Two graduate students finished their training and obtained their Ph.D. during the project and third began their studies in the subject.  One recent Ph.D. graduate began their post-doctoral training as part of the project.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward B Swartz"
