Thus, the specific goal of the proposed project is to develop therapeutic systems to decrease the negative effects of inhibitory proteoglycans and to subsequently enhance axon regeneration. To this end, novel aptamer antagonists against protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-sigma, a receptor for inhibitory proteoglycans in the adult mammalian CNS, will be developed. Another exciting component of the proposed research involves a novel use of biomaterials for sustained delivery of biomolecules in animals. Sustained release of aptamers to the injured spinal cord will be achieved via microparticle/hydrogel composites using oligonucleotide hybridization. This project is truly interdisciplinary research at the forefront of tissue engineering, nucleic acid biotechnology and neuroscience.",
