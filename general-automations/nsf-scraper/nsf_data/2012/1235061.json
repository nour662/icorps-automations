 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) collaborative research award is to develop a set of innovative models and solutions for analyzing the three-way interaction among warehousing, inventory, and transportation decisions. The warehouse-inventory-transportation problem (WITP) for multi-echelon and multi-period supply chains is proposed and modeled through a stochastic integer quadratically-constrained program (SIQCP). Decisions associated with products with differing life-cycles flowing through the supply chain are also considered in the WITP. To solve industry-sized stochastic WITP instances, a seamless integration of decomposition approaches for stochastic integer linear programming (SILP) and continuous convex relaxation techniques for deterministic integer quadratically-constrained programming (IQCP) will be pursued.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will develop novel insights into interactions between the three key supply chain drivers and will prescribe low cost, realistic, plans to supply chain managers. This research will facilitate innovation and excellence in decision analytics at over 600,000 warehouses with annual expenditures of over $100 billion, leading to substantial economic benefit to enterprises both nationally and globally. After successful validation in collaboration with our industry co-PI, opportunities for potential commercialization within the $6.1 billion annual worldwide supply chain software market will be considered. Key findings from this research will be incorporated in an interactive educational website to demonstrate the interplay among warehousing, inventory, and transportation decisions.",

The key question we focused on addressing was, &ldquo;would proactively incorporating warehousing decisions (workforce and technology) during the planning stage reduce inefficiencies at the operational level?&rdquo; To address this question, we proposed the warehouse-inventory-transportation problem (WITP), a new integrated problem in the supply chain literature and industry practice that would allow for joint evaluate of three key distribution network drivers, warehouse, inventory, and transportation decisions. We developed a variety of optimization models and algorithms that systematically evaluated the interaction between warehouse, inventory, and transportation decisions for one product class for a deterministic demand, extended this to a two-product class and proposed a sophisticated algorithm to solve industry-sized problems (200+ stores and 1000+ products), and then considered stochastic demand for this specific cases leading to a two-stage stochastic integer quadratically-constrained programming. The key features of these novel models that consider both workforce planning and technology decisions are the warehouse, in conjunction with inbound and outbound transportation and inventory at warehouse and stores. Because of the ability of our algorithms to solve industry-sized problems, we were able to derive several, relevant, practical insights. We incorporate into the problem demand uncertainties associated with both short and long life-cycle products flowing through the warehouse.</p>\n<p>The impact of this research can be far-reaching. There are over 600,000 warehouses across thousands of supply chains in the US alone, with annual expenditures of over $100 billion. We have already been disseminating our findings with top food, apparel, and grocery distributors in the US, which has furthered our engagement with those companies in an effort to improve their supply chains. One of the products of this research, a dashboard tool, was implemented at our industry partner&rsquo;s warehouse. A web-based educational tool that can help both academic faculty and students, and industry practitioners, was hosted on our lab website and disseminated via listservs. Five graduate students were partially funded on this grant and contributed at various stages in the research; 2 PhD and 3 MS. This helped enhanced their written and oral communication skills, their professionalism through interactions with industry co-PIs, and their ability to handle complex problems and find elegant and relevant solutions. While 1 graduated PhD student is already contributing towards the US economy as a Sr Operations Research Analyst, another PhD student recently graduated and serves as an adjunct instructor. Among the 3 MS students, one is working in the Silicon Valley, the other stayed back for his PhD to work on a recently funded NSF grant, and the third MS student is considering pursuing a PhD as well. Findings of this research have now been integrated into our undergraduate and graduate curriculum on supply chain. Our next step would be to explore the translation of these research findings towards commercialization.</p>\n<p>Project website (web and desktop tool):
