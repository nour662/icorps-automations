 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kieron Burke of the University of California, Irvine, is supported by an Eager award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division.  The award is cofunded by the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory program in the Division of Materials Research and the Computational and Data Enabled Science Program in the Division of Mathematical Science.  Density functional theory (DFT) is at the heart of modern electronic structure calculations, which play an ever increasing role in chemical and material design. Present-day approximations are created by an unholy alliance of inspiration and pragmatism. Progress in their improvement is slow and unsystematic.  Burke and his colleagues are applying Machine Learning (ML) to the   problem of approximating density functionals.  ML provides a totally new way to approximate functionals that takes maximum advantage of DFT formalism.  They have demonstrated that chemical accuracy on self-consistent densities can be reached for a simple model case, and a measure of the reliability of the approximation can be given. The goal of the EAGER grant is to develop these methods in application to DFT, overcoming any challenges, and reaching the real world of electronic structure calculations as quickly as possible, by approaching the problem in a well-defined series of small steps.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project creates an entirely new subfield of theory/computation, in which machine learning (ML), a branch of computer science, is applied to electronic structure problems, a branch of theoretical physics and chemistry that allows prediction of new molecules and materials by solving the equations of quantum mechanics. New algorithms, at the cutting edge of ML research, are being developed in order to apply ML to find density functionals, needed for solving electronic structure. This is a true synergy of physical and computer sciences. Success of this proposal would revolutionize materials design, allowing millions of atoms to be treated instead of hundreds by present methods. This would truly transform predictive capability in a broad range of scientific and technological problems, from biomolecular liquid simulations to crack propagation in materials.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis work showed that, in principal, machine learning could be used to construct approximate density functionals.   This allows new transformative techniques of data science to be applied to a crucial scientific problem.\n\nDFT calculations are used in over 30,000 papers each year, and play a vital role in, e.g., the materials genome project.  DFT calculations in chemistry provide insight and predictive power in many different subfields.  But their accuracy and applicability are limited by the approximations, which can take decades for humans to develop.\n\nThe new approach pioneered in this work shows that machines can find useful approximations by training on accurate examples.  Most importantly, the resulting approximations do not suffer from the limitations of their human-designed counterparts.  A machine-learned approximation was shown to correctly break chemical bonds.  Several scientific papers showed this was possible.  A variety of crucial aspects, including especially the poor quality of functional derivatives from the machine, were studied and several challenges were overcome.\n\nOngoing research in this area is designed to extend this proof-of-principle to more realistic examples, in an effort to have such methods built in to major DFT software packages and applied on a large scale.  These efforts include 3D molecular systems and fully interacting calculations in 1D. \n\nBecause of the simplicity and attractiveness of these methods for young people, several undergraduates and high-school students took part in this research, and some are co-authors on the publications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/25/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kieron J Burke"
