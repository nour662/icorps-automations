 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implantable devices for physiological monitoring are in common use in both clinical and research settings.  Even the most advanced current technologies, however, have limitations due to the need to connect a wire to the recording site.  For example, these systems have particular difficulty recording from moving or fragile structures (such as the spinal cord) because wire electrodes shred fragile nerves as the animal moves. Similarly, it has been difficult to record from freely behaving small animals, particularly those without strong skeletons (leeches, fish). We have developed a new technology that does not have these technical limitations.  This technology has been tested, and we are now moving it into working neuroscience laboratories. Consequently this project includes collaboration between researchers at the University of Minnesota (a major research university) and St. Olaf College (a liberal arts college) and will provide opportunities for development in graduate and undergraduate research and teaching.  Our probe devices can be built extremely cheaply, either hand-built individually by an undergraduate or built en-masse through integrated circuit production. The technology we have developed will be of extraordinary use both in research (due to the ability to record from novel preparations) and in teaching (due to its simplicity, reliability, and low cost).",
