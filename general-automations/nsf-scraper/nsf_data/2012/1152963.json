 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Fisher from Colorado State University will investigate the effect of plasma modification processes on surfaces. Plasma processing has become indispensable in a wide range of applications where high performance materials with tailored surface properties are employed. Moreover, development of new plasma surface modification processes and deposition chemistries is a burgeoning area with impact on biomaterials, coatings, and sensor applications. A more complete understanding of the underlying chemistry in these systems could lead to manufacturing improvements with economic impact across many industries. Thus, the goal of the proposed work is to improve understanding of the fundamental chemical processes that occur at surfaces during plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and surface modification of polymers. Professor Fisher and her students will achieve this goal through an integrated, comprehensive approach to understanding the molecular-level chemistry in these systems. The primary experimental tools to be employed are in situ sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and the laser-based imaging of radicals interacting with surfaces (IRIS) technique, which provides steady-state surface interaction data for plasma species. The SFG experiments are designed to examine the evolution of plasma modified films upon exposure to atmospheric gases to study labile intermediates formed in plasma modification, thereby elucidating mechanisms involved in aging and hydrophobic recovery processes. \r\n\r\nPlasma processing is used to prepare high performance materials with tailored surface properties.  These materials are used in many fields and industries including computational science, information processing, data management, sensor fabrication and communications.  In this project, Prof. Fisher and her students will use a combination of experimental tools to study plasma processing.  The results will enable the development of new materials and the improvement of existing ones.  The intrinsic interdisciplinary nature of this research will afford students a broad exposure to and education in chemistry, engineering, and materials science, beyond the traditional boundaries in chemistry. Professor Fisher will continue her efforts in broadening participation of underrepresented groups and use the proposed experiments to develop demonstrations of plasmas and lasers for visitors, high school groups and K-12 teachers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLow temperature plasmas (LTPs) are extremely useful tools in the creation of advanced, high value-added materials that impact the national economy.  In part, their utility arises from the vast array of reactive species within the plasma environment that interact both in the gas-phase and at the surface of substrates placed within the plasma environment.  Thus, this project has centered on correlating gas-phase and surface analyses with gas-surface interface data to provide deeper insight into the underlying chemical mechanisms at play in LTPs.\n\nThe intellectual merit of the work lies in the overarching goal of deciphering the complex chemistry occurring in the LTP environment.  In particular, this project employed in situ gas-phase optical diagnostics [e.g. optical emission spectroscopy (OES), laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and broadband absorption spectroscopy (BAS)] along with materials synthesis and characterization and unique molecule-surface interface studies.  An added aspect of this work is the ability to perform time-resolved OES (TR-OES) studies which provide detailed information on the kinetics of gas-phase species formation and destruction/decay in LTPs.  Collectively, the BAS and OES data (including TR-OES) provide the foundation for understanding energy partitioning in these complex systems as we derive rate constants as well as internal (vibrational, rotational) temperatures for a range of plasma species.  These studies clearly reveal that a molecular-level understanding of the chemical mechanisms occurring in LTPs can profoundly impact our ability to design high performing advanced materials such as those found in toxic gas sensors, tissue engineering, and catalytic removal of pollutants from the atmosphere.   An additional component of these studies was development of methodologies for appropriately applying traditional analytical techniques (e.g. measuring wettability via contact angle measurements) to unconventional substrates such as porous polymeric constructs for tissue engineering and water purification.\n\nAs one example, tin oxide nanomaterials were explored as possible toxic gas sensors.  Studies performed in this project included exploring the use of plasma surface modification to increase the viability of these sensors for the detection of gases like carbon monoxide and benzene.  One mechanism for increasing sensor performance is to increase surface area and oxygen at the surface.  Nnanostructured materials can address the former, whereas LTPs can potentially address the latter. The attached figure shows untreated (UT) nanomaterials and the same materials treated in two different LTPs (H2 and H2O), both of which reduce the tin in the original material.  Clearly a change in morphology is also observed upon plasma treatment.  A range of different experiments have elucidated how these changes occur on a molecular level (etching of the material with accompanying release of Sn and OH from the surface), as well as how to control them and ultimately, the impact on the overall performance of these materials (both treated and untreated) as a sensor for detection of carbon monoxide and benzene.  This represents only one of several examples of the multipronged approach utilized in this project to understand the foundational chemistry of LTPs.\n\nThe broader impacts of this work lie in the potential for significantly altering a range of industrial applications for advanced materials.  Indeed, the versatility of LTPs has led to their use across a vast array of applications that impact the national economy, including modern lighting systems, microelectronics, and protective coatings, and more recently, applications of pollution control, plasma medicine, and biomaterials development.  Despite this enormous utility, understanding and predicting the fundamental processes in LTPs remain complex challenges.  Thus, deciphering the underlying chemistry in these systems allows for control and prediction of plasma processes.  In addition to this impact, the project supported a range of trainees, the majority of whom were women, at all levels, including postdoctoral fellow, graduate and undergraduate students.  The undergraduate researchers who have graduated have matriculated advanced degree programs and the graduate students are all gainfully employed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ellen R Fisher"
