 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graph algebras provide a fascinating link between the fields of operator algebras and dynamical systems. The proposed research explores this connection in two different directions. The graph algebras, introduced by Cuntz and Krieger in 1980, have been generalized and extended in a variety of ways to comprise a large collection of interesting C*-algebras. The investigator, along with collaborator Gabriel Nagy, has recently found a new proof of a generalized Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem. This work has led to their discovery of a class of C*-subalgebras, pseudo-diagonals. One of the defining properties of these classes involves pure state extensions, a topic that has seen a great deal of interest since the Kadison-Singer Problem was first introduced half a century ago. This proposal seeks to further investigate the relationship and parallels between pseudo-diagonals and the other special Cartan-like subalgebras, as well as to answer some related questions about state extensions. On the other hand, one can define a shift space from a directed graph. The investigator intends to analyze the corresponding graph algebras in order to shed light on the famous Williams Conjecture of symbolic dynamics. This conjecture, which asserted that the notion of matrix shift equivalence was a complete invariant for topological conjugacy, was disproved by Kim-Roush and Wagoner in 1997. Their work leaves open many questions and lines of enquiry. Graph algebras have been studied since the early 1980s and appear in many areas of the field of operator algebras. The theory of Cartan subalgebras of C*-algebras is an area with much potential, as Renault's definition and major results on the subject appeared only two years ago. The topological conjugacy problem is fundamental to the area of symbolic dynamics and has been studied by a large number of experts; any progress on this problem will be a breakthrough, and the investigator's operator-algebraic approach is new. \r\n\r\nBoth parts of this research project will have broader impacts both within the investigator's institution and in the mathematical community as a whole. The investigator is a member of a mathematics department with a strong commitment to mentoring graduate and undergraduate students. She is actively involved in a number of activities, such as coordinating a math subject GRE preparation workshop and running a seminar aimed at graduate students. The investigator will supervise an undergraduate and a graduate summer research project on work related to this proposal. Finally, the investigator's publications and lectures at conferences on this research will strengthen the bridge between dynamics and operator algebras and foster communication between the specialists in these fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research in this project was in the area of operator algebras, a branch of mathematics motivated by the beginnings of the study of quantum mechanics in the first half of the twentieth century.  An operator algebra, and in particular a C*-algebra, is a collection of operators on Hilbert space (infinite-dimensional Euclidean space, the natural setting for mathematical physics) satisfying certain algebraic and analytical closure properties. \n\nMyriad constructions can be used to form a C*-algebra; the PI's work in this project focused on C*-algebras defined from combinatorial objects such as directed graphs.  Graph algebras form a large class of C*-algebras that have been studied widely in the last few decades and provide a bridge between the fields of operator algebras and dynamical systems.  A central question is whether a particular C*-algebra defined from a graph is \"universal\"; uniqueness theorems address this question.  The main results of this project extend the PI's uniqueness theorem for graph algebras to higher-rank graph algebras (a larger class) and finally to groupoid algebras (an even larger class). \n\nCritical to this analysis was the identification of a certain C*-subalgebra, which turned out to be worthy of examination in its own right; the properties of this subalgebra discovered by the PI have inspired further research in this area by a number of mathematicians.  Groupoids are categorically-defined structures that have applications in a number of areas of algebra, for example; the extension of the PI's program to C*-algebras defined from these objects leads to further connections with other fields.\n\nThis research has been published in the Journal of Functional Analysis and the Journal of Integral Equations and Operator Theory.\n\nThe PI was invited to speak on this work at fifteen conferences and seminar series during the period of the grant.  Most notably, she was a plenary speaker at both the 2013 Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS 2013) and at the 2013 Canadian Operator Symposium (COSy).  Several of the lectures she gave were aimed to audiences largely consisting of graduate students and early career reserachers, such as the talk she gave at the University of Nebraska's Student Chapter of the AMS lecture series.\n\nThe PI was the lead organizer and PI of GPOTS 2014.  This 130-person conference included participants from over a dozen countries and allowed for 60 contributed talks, most from graduate students, in addition to the 15 invited plenary lectures. \n\nThe PI is a founding organizer of the Central States Mathematics Undergraduate Research Conference, a joint project between Kansas State University and Truman State University that provides a forum for undergraduates at regional institutions to present their work and receive mentoring from faculty.\n\nThe PI's other activities related to this project had broader impacts in her department -- particularly its graduate program, at her university, in the community of researchers in her field, and in the larger mathematical community.  She serves as graduate director of her department and also serves on her institution's Diversity Committee, SACNAS Advisory Committee, Graduate Council and several faculty senate committees.  She is also the chair of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institution  subcommittee on summer graduate schools, is a mentor with the National Alliance for Doctoral Studies in the Mathematical Sciences, and belongs to the American Mathematical Society's  Community of Graduate Directors.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sarah Reznikoff"
