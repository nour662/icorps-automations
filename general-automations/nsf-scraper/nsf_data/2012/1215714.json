 "awd_abstract_narration": "The thermal evolution and chemical differentiation of the Earth involves the segregation of silicate and metallic melts, and coexisting minerals due to differences in their density.  This single factor impacts the initial condition as the Earth formed its hydrosphere and biosphere (to become a habitable planet), the efficiency of magmatic differentiation, evolution of volcanic systems and character of eruptions, formation of some economic ore deposits, transportation of volatiles through the deep mantle, and heat transfer across the core mantle boundary which, in turn, impacts generation of the magnetic field.  The buoyancy relations between minerals and melts are strong functions of pressure caused by the greater compressibility of melts compared to minerals.  Quantifying the response of increasing pressure on melt properties is challenging given the refractory nature, absence of long range structural order, and complex structural change that accommodates densification of melts.  Critical measurements must be made under well-controlled laboratory conditions. The results of this research will greatly improve our understanding of dynamic processes within our planet and links to motions of the tectonic plates and global geochemical cycle.\r\n\r\nThis research employs novel high-pressure experimental methods utilizing in situ X-ray techniques (microtomography, absorption and diffraction) and acoustic velocity measurements to determine the volumetric properties and structural changes in melts at deep Earth conditions.  The results will help place tighter constraints on properties of the magma ocean, core formation, segregation and convection dynamics, and, ultimately, the thermal and chemical evolution of the Earth.  These data will also contribute to our understanding of present-day dynamics involving the storage and transport of magma through the crust and mantle, spreading of tectonic plates from mid-ocean ridges, mantle plume upwelling, and possible reactions at the core-mantle boundary.  Additionally, our efforts in connection with this project will help to further expand the opportunities for microtomography research at high pressures for the study of partial melting and deformation, among other phenomena at high pressures requiring detailed microstructure characterization in 3D.  It is anticipated that the results of this work will have long-term benefits in the search and characterization of new exotic materials synthesized at high temperature and pressure for industrial applications.",
