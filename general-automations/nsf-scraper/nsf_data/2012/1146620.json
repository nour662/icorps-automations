 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the development of multicellular organisms, cell differentiation is tightly coordinated with cell division.  In animals, loss of control of cell division leads to cancer.  In both plant and animal differentiation, some cell types display a modified cell division cycle where the DNA is replicated without concomitant cell division, thus, increasing nuclear DNA content.  This is called endoreplication; in plants, important examples of endoreplicated cell types include cereal endosperm, cotton fibers, and nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodules in legumes.  Although endoreplication is known to be important in these critical systems, its detailed mechanism and regulation remain poorly understood.  Previous work using Arabidopsis leaf hairs (trichomes) as a model for cell differentiation demonstrated that the SIAMESE (SIM) gene encodes a cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor that suppresses mitosis during establishment of endoreplication, and defined a gene family of SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) genes found in all land plant genomes that may function similarly.\r\n  \r\n\tThe project aims are to better define the biochemical mechanisms through which the SIM protein inhibits cell division, to test hypotheses about how the SIM protein itself is regulated, and to investigate the roles of some of the SMR genes in plant growth and development.  By illuminating the mechanisms underlying endoreplication and the coordination of cell division and cell differentiation, the project will advance the understanding of plant growth and development relevant to improvement of both traditional crops and production of biomass for biofuels.  Additionally, comparison of plant and animal cell cycle control mechanisms may give useful insights relevant to human disease.  Finally, the projected work will play a role in the education of graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students from diverse backgrounds.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlant growth depends upon the balance between cell proliferation via mitotic cell division and cell expansion.  Cell proliferation is the result of the mitotic cell cycle, which is driven by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), key regilators of the cell cycle.  The SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) gene family, discovered by the Larkin lab in 2006, encodes a plant-specific family of CDK inhibitors that block mitosis, typically resulting either to a phase of cell expansion and differentiation, or to cell cycle arrest.  The work during the current funding period clarified the specific CDK protein complexes that are inhibited by SMRs.  It was also found that the genomes of all land plants contain multiple genes encoding SMRs, with the genetic model plant Arabidopsis thaliana having 17 SMR genes and rice having seven.  The gene family was originally discovered based on a mutation causing unexpected cell division in leaf hairs (trichomes) of Arabidopsis, which protect plants against insect herbivores. During the current award period, it was shown that while all SMRs have the same fundamental biochemical role of inhibiting CDK activity, they play a variety of important roles in plant growth and development, including regulating leaf size and blocking cell division to allow cells to repair damaged DNA.  Unexpectedly, at least one SMR also plays a role is helping plants defend against pathogens, though the mechanism behind this role is unclear.  Thus understanding the roles of SMRs in plant growth and development may help us to improve crop yields for both traditional agriculture and biofuels.  A bit more far-fetched, but still possible, is the chance that the study of SMRs may lead to novel cancer treatments.  Cancer is a disease caused by uncontrolled cell division, and CDKs are targets of some anticancer drugs.  SMRs appear to inhibit CDK function by a novel mechanism, and thus study of SMR biochemistry may conceivably lead to novel anticancer drugs.  This work was reported in three papers published in scientific journals, and was presented in poster format at two national research conferences.\n\n \n\nThis award also contributed to the training of two research graduate students, one of whom completed his Ph.D. in 2015.  Three high school teachers also received M.S. degrees for research on the effectiveness of various teaching methods in science classrooms under the guidance of the principle investigator.
