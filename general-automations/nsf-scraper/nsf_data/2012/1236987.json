 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:\tThe objective of this program is to explore the feasibility of photonic devices on paper substrates, with the ultimate goal of developing a new paradigm of ultra low cost photonics printed on paper using roll-to-roll approaches.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\tThe intellectual merit is in combining of one of the oldest and most widely utilized natural materials ? paper (cellulose) ? with one of the newest and most exciting categories of devices ? photonics. Paper is a very attractive substrate material for selected device applications: very low cost, available in almost any size (from pre-cut to roll-to-roll), versatile (surface finishes can greatly alter its properties), portable (light weight) and flexible. The photonics-on-paper is a transformative concept that has possibility of revolutionizing the field of photonics by enabling ultra low cost fabrication of integrated chips on the most ubiquitous renewable and biodegradable material. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\tThe broader national impacts are: (a) potential revival of the American photonics industry, which has experienced loss of initiative and market share to Asia-based competitors, through close collaboration with American paper companies; (b) potential for using low-cost photonics in the developing world, where cost is paramount; (c) significant step forward in the development of ?green? devices through the use of a renewable natural material as a major component. The broader local impacts are: (d) involvement of undergraduate engineering students in research projects through specifically designed capstone ?senior projects? in Electrical Engineering; (e) increase in underrepresented student participation through the Emerging Ethnic Engineers Program and the Rowe Center for Women.",
