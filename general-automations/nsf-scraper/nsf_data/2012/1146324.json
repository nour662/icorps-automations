As of today, the biodiversity of these tropical montane highlands is very poorly known. Previous work hints that these areas may be some of the most species rich on earth, and may contain vast numbers of endemic species with restricted ranges. \r\n\r\nThese species represent the largest number of vertebrate animals yet to be discovered and described by scientists.The survey will likely discover hundreds of new species from this poorly known area of the world and will result in educational and research partnerships between Indonesia and the USA. As a benefit to the scientific community, the project will produce modern specimen repositories and web-based resources for identification and conservation management, and for genetic and biodiversity work.",

Over four years these institutions have completed one of the most thorough and well-planned large scale taxonomic inventory of a highland tropical herpetofauna (reptiles and amphibians). Until this collaborative project the Javan and Sumatran tropical montane herpetofaunas were among the least explored and potentially most species rich on earth.

Identification of areas of endemism and new species from montane habitats is facilitating conservation. This project is establishing baseline data for comparative studies with other tropical mountain systems, including habitat fragmentation, coevolution, vicariance, and effects of climate change. Additionally, over 10,000 museum specimens, with respective DNA samples and photographs have been collected for scientific study, for immediate taxonomic work and for dissemination to the international scientific community. The over 10,000 DNA sequences generated for taxonomic work are being deposited through open access repositories, providing users with collection locality data, in vivo photographs and tools for tree generation and visualization.</p>\n<p>The project has provided direct <em>field training</em> and involvement to multiple researchers (Indonesian 4; US 4) and undergraduate (Indonesian 27; US 1) and graduate (Indonesian 2; US 6) students; and <em>laboratory training</em> to Indonesian (researchers 3, undergraduate students 2) and US participants (undergraduate students 4, graduate students 6).
