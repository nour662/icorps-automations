 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research initiation grant brings together an interdisciplinary group of engineering and education researchers to conduct mixed-method study of how formal and informal interactions with engineering faculty and professionals influence the attitudes and intentions of under-represented students.  The study will utilize a social capital theoretical framework to explore decision points in students' progression through an engineering degree.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project arises from the focus on students traditionally under-represented in engineering as well as the ability of the project to inform how mentoring and advising can be structured to improve retention or other outcomes in engineering degree programs.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.",

The project includes four studies, whose outcomes illustrate different facets of URM engineering persistence at entry and later stages.\n\n1. Differences in pre-college interactions, early expectations, and perceived barriers for engineering students from underrepresented groups\n\nIn this exploratory quantitative study, we looked at data from the new entrants? questionnaire to investigate how engineering-related interactions prior to college, perceived barriers during engineering studies, and early expectations of interactions with faculty may differ among engineering students related to membership in an underrepresented group. By conducting pairwise comparisons based on gender, parental education, and race/ethnicity, membership in an underrepresented group was associated with significantly greater perceived likelihood of financial barriers (women, first-generation), lack of support from family (first-generation, students of color) and negative attitudes from faculty (first-generation).\n\n2. Engineering-related interactions, perceived barriers, and early expectations of African American and Latina/o new entrants to engineering\n\nIn this qualitative case study of African American and Latina/o students entering into engineering, we explored the question: What are the engineering-related interactions prior to college, perceived barriers during engineering studies, and early expectations of interactions with faculty for first year African American and Latina/o engineering students?  Analysis of these data revealed three important themes: pre-college interactions with educators (particularly calculus teachers); limited early interactions with engineering faculty; factors that affect student-faculty interaction and faculty perceptions of students; desire and expectations for faculty to provide links to opportunities; and unique factors and barriers related to the nature and culture of engineering.\n\n3.

Descriptive quantitative data indicate that persisters view their relationships with engineering faculty as positive and supportive, and they employ several types of capital, particularly aspirational capital (ability to maintain hopes and dreams for the future) and linguistic capital (having the ability to switch communication styles or language).
