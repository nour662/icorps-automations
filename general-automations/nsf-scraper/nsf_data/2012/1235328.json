 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2013 GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect from Peru to Tahiti will cross an entensive oxygen deficient zone typically described as \"suboxic\"; however, measurements of sulfate reduction in this region suggest it may have some anoxic characteristics due to the presence of free sulfide.  Redox conditions influence the solubility/stability of many trace elements which in turn affects their vertical and horizontal transport.   A scientist from Old Dominion University plans to analyze water samples collected during the cruise for dissolved iodate/iodide, arsenic [As(III)/As(V)], selenium [Se(IV, VI), particulate Se(0), and nano- to picomolar hydrogen sulfide speciation (total, free/uncomplexed).  These measurements, along with nitrate/nitrite, nitrous oxide, and iron species determined by other participants during the cruise, will be used to constrain the range of redox conditions within the oxygen deficient zone, assess the importance of in-situ reduction versus horizontal advection of the redox species, and the changing redox conditions within the hydrothermal plume of the East Pacific Rise.  Availability of this data will also enable other researchers to determine the behavior of other redox sensitive trace elements in the ocean. \r\n\r\nAs regards the broader impacts, in addition to contributing to the overarching goals of the GEOTRACES Program, one postdoc, one graduate student, and one undergraduate student would be supported and trained as part of this project.",

Many of these changes are easily seen and measured, but another change is less apparent since it is well below the surface &ndash; the amount of oxygen dissolved in the water below the sunlit zone (ca. 200-800 m depth) is decreasing. The reasons for this decrease are a combination of warming waters increasing bacterial respiration as they consume dead organic matter, changes in the way the water circulates and brings oxygen to deeper waters, and in some locations increased phytoplankton (microscopic plants) growth from excess nutrients increasing the flux of organic matter from the surface to the deeper ocean where it is then respired and oxygen decreases. While low oxygen clearly affects fish and other animals in the ocean, it also alters the chemistry of the water. This research project examined how low oxygen affects the cycling of essential (e.g., iron) and toxic (e.g., arsenic) trace elements, but more importantly explored new ways to study and measure the chemistry of low oxygen waters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the world&rsquo;s largest low oxygen zones is off the Peru shelf where high biological productivity due to nutrient inputs from upwelling produces large amounts of organic matter that is then respired in deeper, subsurface waters. This is a great natural laboratory to examine the chemistry of low oxygen waters. In October &ndash; December 2013 we used the Research Vessel Thompson to sample a total of 37 stations from top to bottom from Peru to Tahiti (Figure 1; we left from Manta, Ecuador, but sampling was from Peru to Tahiti). Chemists measure various constituents like nutrients and trace elements to examine processes happening in the water column where they sampled, but it is important to realize that physical transport (e.g., ocean currents) can bring chemical constituents from elsewhere and may not be just reflecting processes in the water column of a given station. In other words, while you may measure very low oxygen concentrations at a particular location, the oxygen consumption could have happened elsewhere and the signal transported to a given location. Separating the processes happening at a given location and depth (in situ) from those what happened elsewhere was one of the goals for this project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To do this research we measured dissolved oxygen, and a series of oxidized/reduced compounds: nitrate/nitrite, iodate/iodide, selenite/selenite, and arsenate/arsenite. We also collaborated with other scientists studying iron (reduced iron is Fe(II)), and the radioactive isotopes <sup>228</sup>Ra and <sup>234</sup>Th. Examples of these data are shown in Figures 2 and 3, with oxygen having a tongue of very low, almost zero, concentrations between 50 and 600 m depth and starting at the coast and going offshore for almost 1000 km (Fig. 2). Iodide (I<sup>-</sup>, reduced form of iodine; Fig. 3A), nitrite (reduced form of nitrogen; Fig 3B) also have highest concentrations in the low oxygen tongue, but As(III) (reduced form of arsenic; Fig. 3C) does not. This tells us that the oxidation/reduction (redox) conditions in the low oxygen waters are sufficiently strong to allow iodine and nitrogen reduction, but not strong enough to reduce arsenic. This has been observed before and is not unusual, but it is contradicted by the observation in Fig. 3D that there is Fe(II) in these same waters. However, reducing iron to Fe(II) requires stronger reducing/low oxygen conditions; how or where did the Fe(II) form? We hypothesized that the Fe(II) is formed in anoxic sediments in coastal Peru and then transported by currents and diffusion offshore. To check this we used <sup>228</sup>Ra data since this isotope has a unique and strong source in sediments, and a plot of Fe(II) vs. <sup>228</sup>Ra shows a strong correlation. Further, the radioactive <sup>228</sup>Ra allows us to calculate the rate at which this sediment Fe(II) is transported offshore. This shelf flux rate is almost identical to the rate at which Fe(II) would have to be produced or delivered to the offshore waters. Thus, the combination of radioactive tracers and trace element data for reduced or oxidized compounds can be combined to evaluate trace element sources. In a changing ocean it is critical that we use methods like this to evaluate whether changes in the concentrations and chemical forms of biologically essential elements like iron, or toxic ones like arsenic, are due to changes in the water column or in coastal environments, including sediments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/14/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gregory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Cutter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1235328/1235328_10210632_1500084822994_CutteretalRedoxFigure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1235328/1235328_10210632_1500084822994_CutteretalRedoxFigure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1235328/1235328_10210632_1500084822994_CutteretalRedoxFigure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
