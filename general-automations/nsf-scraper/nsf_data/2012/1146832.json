 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximately two-thirds of all songbird species that breed in eastern North America migrate to tropical areas for the winter, requiring most species to cross the Gulf of Mexico. Flights across the gulf are considered hazardous and may result in mass mortality. Atmospheric conditions over water, as well as characteristics of the birds themselves (e.g., age, physical condition), are likely important predictors of birds' migratory routes and survival. However, most knowledge about when, where and how small birds cross large water bodies and their survival remains speculative, because until now researchers have been unable to track individuals between the start and end points of over water flights. Anticipated changes in atmospheric structure and dynamics caused by climate change urgently require an understanding of how migrating birds interact with the atmosphere. This knowledge will provide insight to potential consequences of climate change on migratory songbirds, many of which are experiencing population declines. Knowledge of animal-atmosphere relationships is timely as wind energy development accelerates and coastal habitat alteration along migratory flyways continues. The interdisciplinary research team will combine modern radio telemetry and favorable geography to document migratory flights of songbirds across the gulf. By integrating field data, atmospheric data and computational simulations and analyses, the team will provide the first estimate of songbird survival during migration across open water. They also will study factors shaping birds' migratory routes and timing. The team will promote learning, excitement and appreciation for science, and animal migration in particular, to non-scientists through educational materials (e.g., animated migration trajectories in Google Earth\u00a9). The team will disseminate findings to scientists, reserve managers and the general public via presentations, publications, a bilingual project website, and popular media. American and Latino undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will participate in each phase of research to acquire learning and skill-building opportunities.",
