 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Fereshteh Billiot of Texas A & M University Corpus Christi and Professor Kevin Morris of Carthage College and their undergraduate student researchers will be supported to investigate the effect of pH on chiral recognition by amino acid derived surfactants towards other species.  The effect of pH on these surfactants will be studied with solution-phase nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods, combined with other physical characterization methods.  The surfactants show promise as pseudo-stationary phases in capillary electrophoresis separations of chiral mixtures.   \r\n\r\nChiral molecules are molecules that have \"handed\" symmetry.  They differ in structure from each other only in the sense that they are mirror images of each other.  Since they have identical chemical structures, except for their handedness, mixtures of the chiral isomers are difficult to separate.  Professors Billiot, Morris and their students are interested in designing new ways to separate chiral isomers.  This work has important applications in purification and analysis of pharmaceuticals.  The undergraduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in carrying out the physic-chemical characterization of these interesting surfactant systems.  As part of this work, Prof. Billiot will continue her strong efforts at encouraging students from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in the sciences",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFunding provided by this grant has enabled several undergraduates and one high school student the opportunity to conduct research that would not have otherwise been available to them.  With the research, of course, comes the mentoring from the two PIs of this grant as well as their higher level of interaction with other students and faculty members.  These interactions often play a critical role in the retention and success of first generation underrepresented students of which many of these students were.  The training and mentorship also helps students be much more successful in their course work.  This is particularly true in such courses as Organic Chemistry, Quantitative Analysis, and Instrumental Analysis as well as others where the skills they develop in the research endeavors had a direct relationship to their coursework thus enhancing their understanding of the course content which translate into an improvement in their research skills.  In addition, the weekly group meetings provided students opportunities to improve their presentation and critical thinking skills in defending and answering questions related to their research presentations.  Work from this proposal has resulted in four peer-reviewed publications with another one submitted and two others in preparation and 24 conference presentations.\n\nIn addition to the impact the research had on students, the research also resulted in significant insights into the effect of pH and type of counterion on enantiometic recognition with amino acid based micelles.  Recent studies examining the effect pH and the type of counterion on the size and shape of leucine based amino acid micelles have shown that pH had little effect on the size of the micelles when sodium was used as the counterion.  However, when lysine and arginine were used as the counterion, pH had a significant effect on the size of the micelle formed.  When micelles were formed by the single amino acid surfactant leucine, with sodium as the counterion, the size of the micelle stayed relatively constant (about 10 angstrom) at pH 7 to 11.5.  However, when arginine and lysine were used as the counterion, the size of the micelles at lower pH (pH 7) was  around14 angstrom.  Interestingly, size of the micelle decreased to around 10 angstrom at pH 11.5 when arginine and lysine used as counterion.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Fereshteh Billiot"
