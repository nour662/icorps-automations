 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) Origami Design for the Integration of Self-assembling Systems for Engineering Innovation (ODISSEI) award is to unite principles of origami and compliant mechanisms to enable the creation of engineered systems with unprecedented performance. Compliant mechanism principles will provide a means to translate origami-based discoveries into engineered systems that achieve desired behaviors. The objective will be accomplished using the following approach: 1) overcome obstacles limiting origami principles from being widely applied to non-paper materials, 2) create design methods that unite origami and compliant mechanism principles, 3) employ the united principles to create engineered systems with unprecedented performance, and 4) exhibit the relationship of origami art to engineering advances. Deliverables include a library of surrogate folds that mimic origami creases, design methods and mathematical modeling approaches for creating origami-based compliant mechanisms, engineered systems that further national goals, student education, broadening participation results, and a traveling museum exhibit with accompanying outreach activities. \r\n\r\nResearch success will enable advances in applications such as highly compact mechanisms (e.g., medical implants, electronics equipment, and aerospace components), collapsible devices that are compact during transport and deployed at the location of operation (e.g., surgical devices, space mechanisms, and search and rescue systems), and applications with limited manufacturing processes available (e.g., microelectromechanical systems and cost-sensitive applications). Commercialization of the research will demonstrate its potential for real and significant economic impact. Engineering, mathematics, and industrial design students will be intimately involved in all aspects of the research. An exhibit of origami art and its extension to engineering and mathematics will be developed for display nationally.",
