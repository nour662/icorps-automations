NSF 0917265\r\n\r\nThe two key characteristics of wireless communications that greatly impact system design and performance are randomly-varying channel conditions and limited energy resources. In wireless systems, the power of the received signal randomly fluctuates over time and distance due to multipath fading, mobility, and changing environment. Moreover, mobile wireless systems can only be equipped with limited energy resources, and hence energy efficient operation is a crucial requirement in most applications. In many wireless communication systems, in addition to energy-efficient operation, satisfying certain quality-of-service (QoS) requirements is of paramount importance in providing acceptable performance and quality. For instance, in voice over IP (VoIP), interactive-video (e.g., videoconferencing), and streaming-video applications in wireless systems, latency is a key QoS metric. Therefore, the central design challenge in next-generation wireless systems, which has the vision of providing communications anytime, anywhere in a reliable and robust fashion, is to provide the best performance levels while making efficient use of energy resources and satisfying certain QoS constraints (e.g., latency, packet loss, buffer violation probability). \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this research is to identify the fundamental limits on the energy efficiency of wireless systems operating under queueing constraints through a unified analysis of information- and queueing-theoretic aspects. The investigators will employ a novel approach to analyze the energy efficiency by combining information-theoretic tools, such as minimum bit energy and wideband slope, with queueing-theoretic tools, such as effective bandwidth and effective capacity. This project seeks to establish a strong analytical framework by rigorously establishing fundamental limits on the energy efficiency under buffer constraints, and also at the same time has the goal of conducting experiments with a testbed and making comparisons with the theoretical findings. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
