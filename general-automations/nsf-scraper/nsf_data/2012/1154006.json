 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kutztown University of Pennsylvania offers scholarships to incoming students majoring in Environmental Science or Marine Science, according to academic talent and financial need.  These students are supported to persist in their studies while developing their awareness of opportunities for careers and postgraduate study in scientific fields.  Because of the interdisciplinary nature and scientific rigor of these two field-based majors, students are well-prepared to apply their knowledge in a variety of STEM areas, both academic and corporate.  A large number of special opportunities target academic success (tutoring, peer- and faculty-mentoring, intensive advising, supplemental instruction), career development (seminars, Learning Community), and leadership skills (leading discussion, presenting research, active involvement in student science clubs, peer mentoring).  Many of these programs are also available to students not receiving scholarships, broadening the impact of the project.  It is anticipated that by the end of the project, 25 to 30 students, many of whom are from rural and industrial urban areas of eastern Pennsylvania and are from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, will benefit through scholarships and learning opportunities.",

With support from the National Science Foundation Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (NSF S-STEM) award, the Kutztown University - STEM (KU-STEM) program team was able to provide not only scholarships to incoming Freshmen and select upper-class students in both the Environmental and Marine Science programs, but also an academic enrichment, research awareness, and career awareness program.&nbsp; The KU-STEM Teaching, Research, And Careers at Kutztown in Science (TRACKS) program provided KU-STEM scholars and interested non-scholarship students a range of opportunities to: succeed academically, promote interest in participation in research projects, promote greater understanding of science, and learn about graduate education and preparation for careers.&nbsp; Each year, through weekly or bi-weekly meetings, the TRACKS program offered students opportunities to learn about strategies for succeeding academically by meeting: 1) inspiring faculty members involved in core courses who provided advice about strategies for success, 2) Career Development Center staff who spoke about resume writing and the interview process, 3) upper class students who had conducted research or who had completed internships, 4) faculty members who spoke about their research and informed students how they might become involved in faculty-sponsored research projects, and 5) seminar presenters including professionals from government agencies or universities and alumni of the Environmental or Marine Science programs who had completed graduate degrees.&nbsp; Further, each year KU-STEM scholarship students and other STEM students participated in day or overnight field trips to science museums or biological/scientific field stations.&nbsp; The KU-STEM program provided academic support for KU-STEM scholars and other students, particularly Freshmen, by hiring either Supplemental Instructors, who are student tutors for specific core courses, or Residence Hall Tutors for the residential Science Living Learning Community.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the five years during which students have received scholarship and academic and career support, the KU-STEM program for Environmental and Marine Science students has provided scholarship aid to a total of forty two (42) students with 152 semesters of partial or full scholarship support based on family financial need, or a total of the equivalent of 76 annual academic scholarships given over the five years of the grant.&nbsp; Among KU-STEM scholarship recipients, eighteen (18) graduated with a BS in a science major, twelve (12) were in sound academic standing and are continuing their studies in science after NSF funding ends, nine (9) students left the program due to poor academic performance, two (2) students left the program to pursue non-STEM majors, and one (1) continued their major in science after having received the maximum allowable funding.&nbsp; The KU-STEM TRACKS program has been successful in having KU-STEM scholars achieve academic goals as measured by Grade Point Average and retention and graduation rates.&nbsp; Other KU-STEM TRACKS goals were met through student participation in diverse TRACKS activities that were designed to promote not only academic success but also knowledge about scientific research and applications, and career awareness.&nbsp; In annual TRACKS program assessments, students provided strongly positive evaluations confirming attainment of project objectives related to programmatic activities as well as providing needed input about program improvements.&nbsp; Through objective measures of academic success and through student assessments, we can conclude that we met, and will continue to strive to meet project goals.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/22/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;F&nbsp;Sacchi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1154006/1154006_10157212_1505843535002_KU-STEMPhiladelphiaZooSpring2016--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1154006/1154006_10157212_1505843535002_KU-STEMPhiladelphiaZooSpring2016--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"KU-STEM &amp;
