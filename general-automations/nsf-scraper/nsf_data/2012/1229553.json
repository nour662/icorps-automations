Building upon and leveraging an existing Internet-accessible community resource, the Open Network Lab (ONL, www.onl.wustl.edu), it adds high performance components that can be configured and extended to support a wide range of controlled and repeatable experimental computer networking projects. Through the integration of additional switches and servers and the addition of platform-level server virtualization, this instrument extends the function of ONL by expanding the available physical resources in ONL by a factor of two and, via server virtualization, expanding the effective virtual resources by a factor of approximately eight. The enabled research ranges from future Internet architectures, overlay networks, to peer-to-peer systems. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe proposed instrument can greatly impact the research in future Internet. The instrument is likely to have significant broader impact on undergraduate and graduate education, as well as contribute in attracting more students to careers in science and engineering, thus increasing their participation.",
