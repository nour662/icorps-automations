 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit  \r\nThis project builds on the successful collaboration of an interdisciplinary and diverse group of scholars and disciplines, whose work seeks to improve the quality of research on the linkages among race/ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice. This group, known as the Racial Democracy, Crime and Justice Network (RDCJN) established a Summer Research Institute (SRI) and annual summer workshops with prior NSF support. To date, the group has supported 44 young scholars and produced several volumes of innovative scholarship, including books and special issues of top-ranked specialty journals in the field. The current project seeks to build on these successes.  To advance the science of broadening participation, the project will pursue two closely interrelated goals: First, it will expand the scope of collaborative projects that improve our understanding of the interrelationships among race/ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice. Second, it will advance the research and professional development of young scholars in this branch of the STEM pipeline, including graduate students from underrepresented groups.  \r\n\r\nAchieving Project Goals  \r\nThe PIs will hold additional SRIs for underrepresented faculty and advanced graduate students to enhance their research achievements and success in the academy. The institutes will provide a constructive environment that supports, trains, and mentors young and aspiring faculty in the completion of papers/proposals for journal publication or grant review, offer a tool-kit of information for survival in the university, and reduce isolation of young scholars. In the long run, these activities will contribute to a critical mass of scholars from underrepresented groups whose work is visibly placed, and whose presence and success encourages students-of-color, women, etc. to pursue research and teaching careers. Summer workshops, held separately, will enable participants to develop collaborative projects in the field. These workshops will provide scholars from different disciplines, backgrounds, and career stages with the means to develop, report, and improve on on-going research. Workshops will also support the broadening participation activities of the SRI, especially by integrating underrepresented junior scholars into an energetic network of scholars. Institutes and workshops will also focus direct attention on contemporary issues such as Housing, Lending Patterns and Crime; Race, Crime and Justice in Comparative and International Contexts; and Youth, Peer Culture, and Criminal Justice.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis project has the potential for broader impact in multiple areas. First, the central premise of this work is that the complexity of social relations, including race/ethnicity, shapes our understanding of crime and criminal justice. Participants employ collaborative, multi-method, multi-disciplinary and comparative studies. Findings may improve our understanding of how racialization relates to our understanding of citizenship and democracy, nationally and around the world.  Thus, findings may be of interests to the law enforcement and social service providers, urban planners, the law enforcement and policy communities, as well as the general public. Second, the project draws on the expertise of diverse scholars to carry out innovative crime and justice research and purposely seeks to broaden participation in the field by fostering the careers of scholars from underrepresented groups.  The workshops and SRIs will enhance not only future research but also training and curricula in criminology and criminal justice fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has sought to achieve two objectives:  (1) broadening participation in crime and criminal justice research by enhancing the research activities and professional development of young scholars from underrepresented groups for carrying out innovative analyses in this area; and (2) facilitating and conducting research that enhances understanding of the relationships between race, ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice by a national group of scholars known as the Racial Democracy, Crime and Justice Network (RDCJN).\n\nTowards broadening participation, each year during the grant period (2013-2015) we held a 3-week Crime and Justice Summer Research Institute (SRI) during which we worked with 24 (8 per year) young faculty (called Fellows).  Through the SRIs we sought to provide Fellows with tools for succeeding in research endeavors and in academe more generally, and to reduce their isolation as scholars.  Thus, Fellows:  worked with senior faculty mentors to develop research publications or grant proposals; attended professional development workshops geared to survival within the university; presented and gained feedback on their research during the RDCJN conference at the end of the institute (planning and carrying out the conference is a second major activity of the project); and, were integrated into the larger network of faculty making up the RDCJN.  The RDCJN consists of junior and senior faculty from across the country who are committed to peer and senior mentoring of younger scholars, and who work collaboratively to provide a broader and deeper understanding of the role of race and ethnicity in crime and justice.  Our surveys, in-depth interviews, and annual tracking of Fellows? academic success indicate that the project has been very productive.  Young faculty credit the project with helping them achieve their career goals; among the 24 Fellows, eight have applied for and received tenure or promotion (decisions for the other three applicants are still pending but their prospects for success are very promising); and, 10 of the 24 projects have been published as journal articles or books, and numerous others are under review for publication consideration.\n\nTowards enhancing understanding of how race, ethnicity, crime, and justice are related, RDCJN participants, individually and collaboratively, are very active in producing scholarship on this topic, and in setting research agenda pertaining to questions that still need to be answered.  During the grant period, members of the RDCJN produced a special issue of the journal Race and Justice and an edited volume on Deadly Injustice:  Trayvon Martin, Race, and the Criminal Justice System, bringing to six the total number of volumes produced by the group.  Also, several former SRI Fellows organized and held a conference on prisoner reentry and are now developing a seventh volume based on papers presented during the conference.  Additionally, RDCJN members recently edited two journal issues as part of their general academic activities, with a disproportionate share of the articles (around half) in each volume being authored by other RDCJN members, including some SRI Fellows. In general, research flowing from the RDCJN attempts to provide innovative and exemplary studies that move the field forward.  Substantively, the findings and conclusions from our work:  are relevant to a host of theoretical issues in criminology; speak to a variety of issues or groups that have been neglected in the field; demonstrate the importance of treating race and ethnicity as structured aspects of society rather than simply as individual characteristics of offenders and victims; and, demonstrate the importance of embedding understanding of this issue not just in theories of crime, but also within broader societal theories.  The work also benefits the field by bringing the perspectives of underrepresented scholars into the mainstream (i.e., traditional publication outlets) of criminology.\n\nThree additional points are noteworthy.  First, overall the activities of the SRI and RDCJN provide models of success for members of underrepresented groups, contribute to the long-term presence of additional faculty within academe who can contribute to the success of students from underrepresented groups, and provide quality insights regarding race, ethnicity, crime, and justice that informs the knowledge base in ways that will help solve problems and reduce inequality in crime and criminal justice.  Second, the success and positive outcomes of our approach to broadening participation and perspectives on crime and justice has not gone unnoticed by academic organizations seeking to become more inclusive.  Notably, leaders of the RDCJN have been honored by their universities or by professional associations (e.g., the American Society of Criminology, the Crime, Law Deviance and Law and Society sections of the American Sociological Association) for their work in these areas.  Third, because of our success, we have shared information (through newsletter articles and invited talks) about our approach and lessons learned with organizations and universities looking for productive approaches to broadening participation.\n\nWe invite you to visit our websites (https://cjrc.osu.edu/sri; https://cjrc.osu.edu/rdcjn) for additional information about the activities and outcomes of the SRI and the RDCJN.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ruth D Peterson"
