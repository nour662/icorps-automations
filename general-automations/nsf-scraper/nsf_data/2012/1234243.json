 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to tailor modern topology optimization theories and procedures to improve practical design processes of buildings subject to stochastic excitations caused by natural or man-made hazards. By considering random vibrations and structural reliability into the structural design process, the proposal aims to provide optimum structural system for buildings. If successful the theoretical development will lead to optimal design of tall building that saves construction material while providing reliable service and expected safety during earthquake events. The industrial partner will act as advisor to the project to ascertain that the results are relevant to the society.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on concepts of structural topology optimization considering dynamic excitations for building systems. It will create a new framework for finding optimal topology of structures under stochastic excitations caused by wind and earthquake loadings. It will also investigate influence of stochastic excitations on optimal topology and find equivalent load profiles for efficient topology optimization. By integrating random vibration theory and system reliability into topology optimization, it would be possible to identify optimal topologies for discrete (beam/column) elements as well. A simplified equivalent static load profile will be developed to facilitate design of lateral load systems. Results of this research will be adapted into the curriculum at UIUC, and a new optimization course will be introduced. The Co-PIs plan to continue their involvement in the existing programs at the institution to attract students from underrepresented groups.",
