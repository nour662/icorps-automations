In particular, this project seeks to improve our scientific methodology, understanding, and quantitative predictive ability of these systems by developing (1) a novel experimental approach for investigating the spatial distribution of liquid in particulate systems and (2) an experimentally validated computational model for predicting the liquid dispersion in more complex, industrially relevant manufacturing equipment.  The experiments will be performed in-situ using an x-ray tomography method, therefore retaining the liquid spatial distribution and time evolution of the mechanical dispersion process.  These in-situ measurements differ from those reported in the literature, which assessed the evolution of the liquid dispersion process by removing particles from the experimental device.  The experimentally validated computational model will simulate the dynamics of particles in a sheared system, taking into account inter-particle contacts and the effects of the liquid ?bridge? joining two or more particles.  \r\n\r\nThe dispersal of a binding or coating agent, such as a liquid or solid material, onto particles is commonplace in many industrial processes.  In the pharmaceutical industry, for example, such a mechanism is used to combine inactive and active ingredient powders into granules, which are then used to make tablets or capsules.  Most previous work focused on systems involving liquid coatings that dry quickly and do not transfer significantly from particle to particle.  The transfer of liquid through mechanical dispersion has rarely been investigated, which is unfortunate since in many industrial processes the coating liquid is too viscous to be sprayed and, thus, is poured onto the powder bed and dispersed through particle contacts.  At present, the design and optimization of these systems are carried out through trial and error, resulting in significant time for development, loss of materials, and potentially reduced product effectiveness.  Successful completion of the objectives of the present study will greatly enhance our understanding of the processes involved in the mechanical dispersion of liquid in particulate systems, as well as our ability to quantitatively predict and design the operation of a mechanical dispersion-driven system.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research supported by this NSF grant focuses on how to predict the rate at which liquid is transferred between particles during mixing.  This problem is of interest since coating liquids onto particle surfaces is common in manufacturing operations, such as the manufacture of powdered laundry detergents and solid dosage form pharmaceutical products.  Models currently exist for predicting the forces between wet particles as well as the liquid transfer between particles when the particles separate; however, these models need the volume of liquid participating in the liquid bridges between the particles.  Unfortunately, current models for this liquid bridge volume have not been validated, vary considerably from one another, and, as shown in the work supported by this grant, are inaccurate.  As part of this grant we developed two new liquid bridge volume models, performed an experiment to validate one of the models, and performed experiments to measure the rate of liquid transfer in a bulk system of particles.  The results from these efforts have been presented in four conference presentations and a conference poster.\nThe two new liquid bridge volume participation models include one that models the liquid movement over a smooth, spherical particle?s surface during the formation of the liquid bridge.  This liquid flow was modeled using a commercial computational fluid dynamics software package.  The second model assumes that a particle?s surface is rough and that liquid is trapped within this roughness.  Liquid is not mobile on the particle?s surface in this latter model and only transfers between particles when a region in which liquid is trapped contacts another particle?s surface.  We observed that in the smooth particle surface model that the final shape of the liquid bridge, i.e., whether it?s a convex bridge or a concave one, depends primarily on the ratio of the film thickness to the radius of the particle.  Small ratios result in concave bridges while large ratios result in convex ones.  When concave bridges form, the film on the particle surface becomes increasing thinner and at some point, ruptures.  At this point there exists a concave liquid bridge between the particles and a liquid droplet on the other side of the particles.  Convex liquid bridges don?t display such behavior.  Another significant finding is that when the liquid properties are sufficiently viscous, the final liquid bridge volume is independent of the liquid properties and only depends on the geometry of the system.  The rate at which liquid drains into the liquid bridge is found to be modeled reasonably well with an asymptotic exponential function.  Experimental measurements in which the rate of liquid transfer into the bridge is measured is consistent with the modeling work. For rough particles, we observe that the rate of liquid transfer between particles in a bulk flow is much smaller than it is for smooth particles since the transfer of liquid depends on whether a region containing trapped liquid touches the other particle?s surface.  Thus, the orientation of the particles becomes a significant factor in the liquid transfer rate between particles. \nWe?re currently in the process of making experimental measurements for the rate of liquid transfer in a bulk system.  In these experiments, we track the locations of liquid and particles using x-ray micro-computed tomography measurements, which can peer within the bulk of the system and identify the different material phases.  We anticipate publishing these results in the first half of 2017.\nWith these findings, we can now model liquid transfer rates during particle processing more accurately.  These new models will help reduce the number trial experiments that must be performed to test a manufacturing operation, which in turn will reduce manufacturing costs and time to operation.  In addition, the models may be used to help improve product quality by improving product consistency.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carl R Wassgren"
