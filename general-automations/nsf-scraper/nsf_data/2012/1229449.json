 "awd_abstract_narration": "City College of New York (CCNY) of the City University of New York (CUNY) aims to acquire a state-of-the-art Vevo 2100 high-resolution micro-imaging ultrasound system from Visualsonics. This imaging system will enable both basic science and translational research by providing a novel biomedical research and ultrasound contrast imaging platform for in vivo and ex-vivo studies in several research fields. High resolution ultrasound allows real-time longitudinal studies on many research fields such as cancer, atherosclerosis, tendon, cartilage and ligament damage, tissue repair by stem cells, drug delivery, tissue biomechanics in cardiovascular/soft tissues, the development of novel molecular probes and basic science research on wave propagation on poroelastic media, experimental fluid mechanics by Doppler velocimetry and development of photoacoustic sensors. No such kind of imaging equipment exist in\r\n\r\nCCNY, therefore, acquisition of this system will provide the perfect complement to the existing imaging capabilities at CCNY (i.e. microCT, confocal and light microscopes). Several faculty members from different departments of CCNY (BME, ME, EE, Biology) will benefit of such system.",

(1) It is increasing the research possibilities for undergraduates, graduate students and faculty and it has enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration both within the college and with our hospital partners in the New York Center for Biomedical Engineering (NYCBE). (2) It increased the number of courses with hands-on lab experience available to our students, particularly enriching undergraduate and graduate biomedical imaging courses through a module in Biomedical Imaging courses. (3) It is enhancing the training of undergraduate (through summer research opportunities) and graduate students (PhD research) in imaging methods, including image reconstruction, image processing, numerical modeling, finite element analysis and research design.
