 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project plans to investigate the potential of developing antimicrobial peptides for addition to animal feed for production purposes. Current practices commonly use antimicrobials that are used therapeutically with humans as additives to animal feed, which can result in antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. The antimicrobial peptides investigated in this project show signs of reducing bacterial counts in poultry, but are not used for medical purposes. Antimicrobial peptides will be produced for this project using filamentous fungal fermentation.\r\n\r\nAntibiotics have been used as additives in animal food as an effort to help reduce bacterial levels in poultry and potentially reduce food-borne illness in humans consuming poultry. New guidance published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has restricted administration of antibiotics in animal feed as it has been linked to increasing strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The development of antimicrobial peptides using filamentous fungal fermentation may be an alternative solution to this concern. If successfully developed these antimicrobial peptides will assist in reducing bacterial levels in poultry to reduce food-borne illnesses while not generating antibiotic-resistant strains.",
