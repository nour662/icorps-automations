This workshop will bring together ECCS and CMMI/SES communities to discuss the state of the art and identify research priorities for the future.   Papers from the workshop will be published in two outlets: a special issue of the Journal of Energy Systems, and the Handbook on Smart Grids, both published by Springer.  \r\n\r\nThis workshop on smart grid management and design recognizes that there is a two-way path: from research to practice, and from practical issues to important unsolved research questions. Both researchers and practitioners will contribute to the dialogue, which will inform future research priorities.",
