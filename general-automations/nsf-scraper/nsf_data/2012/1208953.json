Magliocca of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County to conduct a research project, entitled \"Simulating the causes and consequences of local land-use change globally,\" during the summer of 2012 at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China.  The host scientist is Dr. He-Qing Huang.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to use a modeling framework to make a virtual laboratory for exploring the causal roles of demographic, economic and environmental factors that cannot be manipulated in the real world. and thus to shape a wide range of land-use systems globally and advance land-use theory.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
