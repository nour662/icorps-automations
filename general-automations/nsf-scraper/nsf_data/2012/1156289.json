 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation investigates how one's native language and degree of musicianship shape auditory perception by examining the perception of pitch in language and music. The central hypotheses are based on the Reverse Hierarchy Theory of learning, in which sensory experiences tune brain areas to provide better information for solving complex perceptual tasks. This tuning can lead to crossover between domains which are united by common brain areas. The specific proposal is that languages with lexical tone (the inclusion of pitch as an important component of words) share properties of musical melodies. Thus, tone language speakers are expected to show better melody perception, and musicians to show better tone perception.\r\n\r\nThree experiments investigate these issues. The first compares native speakers of Mandarin Chinese, Yoruba (tone languages), and English (nontone language) on a standardized music perception test, measuring discrimination of several properties of melody. It is expected that tone language speakers will outperform English speakers only on those melodic properties shared with lexical tone, and that Mandarin speakers will outperform Yoruba speakers only on those properties which are unique to Mandarin. Second, English-speaking learners of Mandarin participate in the same test. It is expected that after linguistic training, they will show improvement in melody perception similar to native speakers, compared to students learning nontone languages. Third, students taking musical training are tested on their perception of Mandarin tones. It is expected that such musical training will lead to improved perception of lexical tones even without linguistic training. That is, music training should enhance melodic properties shared with lexical tone. \r\n\r\nThese results will provide insight into the cognitive relationship between language and music and the influence of sensory experience during development and adulthood. Thus, they will bear directly on issues of cognitive modularity and language and music training.  This award will also enhance the training of a promising linguistic scholar.",
