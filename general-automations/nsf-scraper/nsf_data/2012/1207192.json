 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis project lays the foundation for a new class of active materials - magnetic shape-memory fibers with tailored geometry, microstructure and magneto-mechanical properties - to be used as transducers for micro-devices and as building blocks for composites or cellular structures. Magnetic-field-induced twinning is responsible for the high magnetoplastic strains achievable in monocrystalline Ni-Mn-Ga. By contrast, polycrystalline Ni-Mn-Ga shows no magnetoplasticity because twinning is inhibited by internal incompatibility stresses developed between adjacent, misoriented grains. The PIs recently discovered that porosity, because it reduces internal stresses, allows twinning to occur in polycrystalline Ni-Mn-Ga foams, resulting in magnetoplastic strains in the foam struts. Applying this concept to individual fibers, our hypothesis is that tailored grain size (with respect to fiber size) and grain orientations will allow tuning the magnetoplastic strain from polycrystalline (0%) to monocrystalline (~10%) behavior.\r\n\r\nIn this basic study, we will develop a fundamental understanding of how fiber geometry and grain microstructure enable magnetic-field-induced strains in polycrystalline Ni-Mn-Ga fibers, leading to experimentally-validated models that can quantitatively predict the magnitude of magnetoplastic strain for a given fiber structure.  Fundamental experimental and theoretical studies probing the mechanisms responsible for magnetoplasticity in the fibers will be carried out.  First, the fiber geometry will be varied, in terms of cross-sectional shape and diameter, by using two versatile manufacturing methods (Taylor wire drawing and melt extraction).  Then, the fiber grain size and texture will be tailored: the ratio of grain to fiber diameter will be varied from <<1 (polycrystalline fiber) to ~1 (bamboo structure) and compared to single-crystal fibers; grain orientation will be varied from random to fiber texture. Third, the magneto-mechanical properties of the fibers will be characterized and numerically modeled on two length scales: (i) at a shorter length scale, models based on the mutual interaction of twinning dislocations  and dislocation-interface interactions will predict the effect of free surfaces on the constitutive behavior of Ni-Mn-Ga in small volumes; (ii) at larger length scale, finite-element models will predict, based on the constitutive behavior, the magneto-mechanical behavior of an assembly of bamboo grains within a fiber.  Collaborators will embed fibers in polymer matrix to create composites to study their magneto-mechanical properties, or create fiber bundles to study their magneto-caloric properties.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe present project is a coupled experimental-theoretical study of the magneto-mechanics of magnetic shape-memory fibers, a novel class of materials.  It focuses on identifying, quantifying and predicting the effects of fiber geometry and grain microstructure upon reduction of internal stresses and the resulting enhancement in magnetoplastic strain, a phenomenon recently demonstrated in struts of foams by the PIs. The results obtained will be general in nature and thus applicable not only to Ni-Mn-Ga but also to the whole class of magnetic shape-memory alloys.\r\n\r\nNi-Mn-Ga fibers with tailored grain structures are expected to show large magnetoplastic strain (i.e. they deform when exposed to a variable magnetic field) which are much higher than magnetostrictive material containing strategic rare-earth elements.  These Ni-Mn-Ga fibers may be implemented without further processing in smart actuators and may thus grow rapidly in industrial importance, resulting in a transformative effect on various sensor and actuator technologies including bio-medical pumps, ink-jet printer valves, power-generation transducers, and haptics devices. Beyond sensor and actuator applications, fibers and fiber constructs may enable new applications such as efficient magnetic cooling devices with high heat-transfer rates due to their large specific areas.  \r\nThis project will educate two graduate students and several undergraduate students, whose recruitment will emphasize women and minorities. Beside research, the students will participate in various outreach activities using the shape-memory materials to introduce materials science and technology to young women, minorities, and grade school (K-12) students. This project will leverage collaboration with four international partners (in Europe and Asia) thereby generating high visibility and impact. The recent results of the PIs resonated strongly with the scientific community and were highlighted in national media. These contacts will be leveraged for disseminating results of the proposed project. The PIs have submitted two patents and pursue a spin-off project for transitioning the field to the US high-technology industry.",
