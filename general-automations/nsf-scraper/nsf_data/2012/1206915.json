 "awd_abstract_narration": "****Technical Abstract****\r\nHybrid systems combine the desirable features of two or more technologies in a way that improves the performance of each component.  This project seeks to develop hybrid \"molecules\" formed of phosphorus dopants embedded inside silicon double quantum dots.  The project will study methods for transferring information between the spins in two distinct subsystems: the electron spin in a quantum dot and the electron spin (or nuclear spin) of a phosphorous donor.  The high degree of tunability of gated quantum dots offers the possibility of new ways to interact with nuclear spins (which are highly coherent) via electronic degrees of freedom (which can be manipulated and measured very rapidly).  This project seeks to probe new types of hybrid states between a donor and a quantum dot, and to use those states to bridge the length scale mismatch between atomic donors and other semiconductor nanostructures.  Computer modeling will provide a link between the experimental results and the underlying theory.  Through this research, graduate students will be trained in areas including nanofabrication, electronic measurement, and theory.  The project will also create a new outreach module, focused on nanoscience, and merge it with a program that currently reaches thousands of students each year.\r\n\r\n****Non-Technical Abstract****\r\nHybrid systems combine the desirable features of two or more technologies in a way that improves the performance of each component.  This project seeks to develop hybrid \"molecules\" formed of individual real atoms embedded inside artificial atoms.  The project will use artificial atoms formed in single-electron transistors that are constructed from two common semiconductor materials: silicon and silicon-germanium.  This project will study methods for transferring information from the artificial atoms to the real atoms (and to the real atomic nucleus, where it is especially long-lived), and back again.  From a practical perspective, the project seeks ways to manipulate atomic systems using tools that work well for silicon transistors.  Fundamentally, the project will probe the interactions between real and artificial atoms-systems that have very different characteristic length scales.  Computer simulations will be used to relate experimental results to the underlying theory.  Through this research, graduate students will be trained in areas including nanofabrication, electronic measurement, and theoretical simulation.  The project will also create a new outreach module, focused on nanoscience, and merge it with a program that currently reaches thousands of students each year.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary scientific goal and intellectual merit of this project was to study quantum semiconductor devices into which one or more donors were implanted.  Participants in the project fabricated these devices in semiconductors formed of silicon and germanium.  Nanofabrication techniques were used to make devices that function in analogy with field-effect transistors with two key differences: instead of one metal gate per device there are many gates, enabling careful control over the number of electrons in the device, and the devices are designed to work at very low temperatures, so that thermal vibrations of the atoms in the semiconductor interfere as little as possible with the device operation.\n\nA primary outcome of the project was the successful implantation of donors into these types of quantum devices.  A technique was developed that allowed implantation into one of two neighboring device regions.  Measurements of electrical current flowing through devices of this type enabled project participants to identify a quantum mechanical coupling between the gate-defined quantum device and discrete, localized states in the donor-implanted region.  That coupling was also shown to be controllable based on the gate voltages of the device.  Participants were able to use a combination of experimental measurements and theoretical simulations to determine the most likely position of such a localized state coupled to a gate-defined quantum dot.\n\nIn order to improve the quality of the quantum devices, participants in this project also demonstrated the fabrication and use of silicon/germanium quantum devices implanted with donors that are very close to the surface.  This was found to enable the fabrication of devices with reduced disorder.  Theoretical simulations aided in designing of devices in the early stages of the project.\n\nThe broader impact goal for this project included primarily the training of students in techniques to perform experiments and understand the underlying physics of quantum devices in silicon, especially quantum devices in which quantum dots are coupled to impurities and defects in the semiconductor that are much smaller than the quantum dots themselves.  Participants in this project also developed a nanoscience module for use in outreach presentations.  Participants also discussed the project specifically and nanoscience more generally with the general public during \"physics fairs\" at the project location.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark A Eriksson"
