 "awd_abstract_narration": "In autumn 2012, Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) will divert ~150 million gallons/day of secondarily-treated effluent to a nearshore (1 mile offshore) outfall pipe over a period of ~4 weeks. No discharges of this magnitude have been conducted in decades. The planned diversion is expected to create a buoyant surface plume that will spread over much of the coastal region. Because OCSD plans to \"super-chlorinate\" and then dechlorinate the discharge, the effect of the plume should be predominantly a nutrient addition rather than direct addition of intact microbial populations. The PIs propose to address two broad questions through a study of the plume.  First, what happens ecologically and physiologically to the phytoplankton assemblage when nutrients are discharged in the surface ocean for extended periods of time? Second, can this dynamic and shifting environment be sampled by deploying multiple technologies to identify the physical/chemical drivers of the biological response at ecologically relevant space and time scales? They will test two hypotheses: H1: Continual discharge of nutrients to the surface ocean results in a dinoflagellate-dominated bloom which leads to dampening or cessation of vertical migration of the dinoflagellates and drives a shift to net heterotrophy. H2: The bloom will initially result in a strong local sink for carbon dioxide which gradually develops into a strong source as heterotrophy develops.\r\n\r\nThe study is expected to provide a time-evolving picture of interactions within and between autotrophic and heterotrophic communities and will illustrate the short-term biogeochemical and ecological consequences of sustained nutrient discharge to a shallow coastal site. The planned diversion provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the ecophysiological response in a natural setting over a period of weeks, including the interaction of biology, chemistry, and physics, and it will contribute to basic understanding of anthropogenic nutrient loading to the coastal ocean. Undergraduate and graduate education and training will be furthered through active participation in lab, field, and data synthesis activities involving academic, government, and industry partners.",
