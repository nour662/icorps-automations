 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to develop a new robotic platform with novel 3D modeling and visualization algorithms. An existing \"dumb\" welding robot will be augmented with sensors to observe the work piece, as well as its surroundings.  New algorithms will be developed to record and reconstruct in 3D the welding process.  The reconstructed data are transmitted to a control room and visualized with augmented reality techniques: A skilled welder can look at the welding process from different angles, as if he/she was right next to the actual welding system. Welding parameters can be adjusted by the human (with intelligence) and executed by the robot (with precision). More importantly, the adjustment, together with the reconstructed welding process, will be recorded and analyzed. System modeling techniques will be developed to correlate the human adjustment with the 3D reconstruction of the welding process.  In this way, a welding robot can \"learn by examples\" the knowledge and experiences of a human welder and make similar intelligent adjustments by itself in the future.  \r\n\r\nThe primary use for this new technology is in manufacturing. Successful completion of the proposed project paves the foundation for intelligent welding robots with closed-loop intelligent control.  Such a robotic system can perform high-speed and high-precision welding while allowing more variations in the work pieces and environments.  In addition, virtualized welding can be integrated with a mobile platform to allow welding in places that are hazardous or unsuitable for human welders.  The proposed welding extension platform will significantly expand the use of welding robots as well as reduce manufacturing costs.  Under-represented students will be recruited to participate in the research through exiting institutional programs.  Additional funding and industrial collaboration to transfer technology from research labs to industry will also be pursued.",
