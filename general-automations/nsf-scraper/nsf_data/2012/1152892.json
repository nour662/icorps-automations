 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Pingshan Wang of Clemson University and his graduate students will be supported to develop an ultra-sensitive, single-pass electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer for the study of paramagnetic samples in the liquid phase.  The instrument will utilize single-pass EPR sensors that exploit interference processes within the devices.  The proposed instrument will be sensitive and fast - an order of magnitude better than current X-band spectrometers.\r\n\r\nEPR spectrometers are essential and powerful analytical tools for chemical studies.  They may be used to detect the presence of electron spin in sample materials.  Besides revealing the presence of unpaired electron spin (as in the case of reactive chemical species) the EPR spectra reveal unique details about the chemical environment, which help in understanding the molecular milieu around \"spin labels\".   A key component of this research program is its educational objectives, which involve a number of students (from graduate school down to high school) who are engaged in scientific research. The instrument design that is developed through this research will be disseminated broadly through a website at Clemson University, as well as through The National Biomedical Research Center for AdvanCed ESR Technology (ACERT) at Cornell University.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project studies novel and tunable interferometry techniques for high-sensitivity broadband electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.  It is demonstrated that interferometers can effectively remove probing microwaves before minute EPR signals are detected.  Thus, nonlinear effects from probing waves are eliminated and EPR signals are measured at extremely high resolutions for their phase and magnitude.  Then absorption and dispersion EPR signals are obtained at extremely low limit-of-detection (LOD).  Furthermore, the interferometer conveniently tunes its operating frequencies and its measurement resolutions, thus, enables broadband EPR measurements with large dynamic ranges.  Moreover, the tuning is shown to enable low LOD measurements of lossy dielectric materials, hence, can alleviates the dielectric loss problem in conventional EPR measurements.\n\nThis project proposed, built, and tested a unique interferometer that is made of two directional couplers.  The interferometer enables convenient measurement of both transmission and reflection signals with a vector network analyzer (VNA) and at low LOD, as demonstrated by measuring various dielectric materials.  Interferometer design methodologies and signal process algorithms are also developed and verified, mostly through measuring well-characterized dielectric materials and with transmission lines.  The algorithms are for system control and material property extraction.  A novel approach to further improve EPR sensitivity and LOD, i.e. incorporating resonators and filters into interferometers, is proposed and demonstrated.  Working at the harmonic frequencies of resonators and filters, multiple frequency measurements are achieved.  Planar microwave resonators on glass substrate are designed, built and tested with 0.2 &micro;g DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) sample.  Measurements show an SNR of 121 when the intermediate frequency (IF) of the VNA detector is 10 kHz.  Broadband microstrip lines are used to measure 6 &micro;g of DPPH between 8 and 13 GHz at an SNR of 194.  Corresponding LOD is significantly better than that of current broadband EPR techniques.  Recent measurement results show that these SNR values can be improved by 100 times or more.  Additionally, the number of EPR spins and the microwave permeability of EPR materials are obtained with the algorithms developed in this project.  These research results are described in 6 journal papers, 5 conference presentations, and 1 issued US patent.\n\nThe novel techniques from this project are expected to enable the development of high-performance EPR instruments with sensitivity, bandwidth, and user-friendliness not previously available to chemists, physicists, biologists, and material scientists.

The project enriched the course materials of two courses.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/20/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Pingshan Wang"
