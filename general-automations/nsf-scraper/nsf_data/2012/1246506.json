This is the largest international annual meeting of fluid dynamicists in the world, with 2500 anticipated attendees. The meeting has been successfully run for over sixty years. The intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting edge research and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in virtually every sub-discipline of fluid dynamics. The broader impact will be to increase participation of students and young scientists who would not otherwise be able to afford to travel to the meeting and pay associated costs.",
