 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing, delivering and evaluating an innovative first-year seminar for computing majors that is designed to increase retention, completion, and success among students, especially women and those from underrepresented groups. Elements from successful first-year engineering courses, introductory computing courses, general first-year seminars, and the new AP CS Principles course combine to create a seminar that provides new computing majors with an overview of the discipline, foundational technical skills, a group design experience, and relevant professional development. A team of computing professors, staff with student affairs experience, and undergraduate students is delivering this highly interactive and learner-centered course. Peer mentors facilitate cohort building and provide informal advice, while undergraduate peer teachers directly support learning. The project is developing a novel course model and materials that are grounded in the research literature on student success, developing a framework for peer-led team learning in introductory courses in computing disciplines, and performing a thorough assessment of the outcomes of these activities. This intervention is improving the pedagogy in beginning computing and technology courses by assessing interventions that increase the retention and success of students in general, and women and underrepresented minorities in particular, resulting in a larger and richer pool of talent to solve important problems. The project also includes regional workshops to share course materials and insights with computing faculty from local two and four- year institutions.",

Their approach synthesizes elements from successful first-year engineering courses, traditional introductory computing courses, general first-year seminars, and the new AP CS Principles course. Course content is designed to provide an overview of the discipline, build technical skills, provide a group design experience, and strengthen professional skills. The learning infrastructure includes collaborations among experienced computing faculty, staff&nbsp;members with student affairs experience, peer mentors to facilitate cohort-building and give informal advice, and undergraduate peer teachers to directly support learning. The specific learning goals of the course are to:</p>\n<p>1. Increase understanding of the discipline, in terms of      different majors and careers.</p>\n<p>2. Clarify students' personal interests and motivations      about their choice of major and career.</p>\n<p>3. Increase confidence, self-efficacy, and community.</p>\n<p>4. Expose students to, and allow them to practice, key      design and development skills.</p>\n<p>5. Strengthen writing, presentation, and teaming skills.</p>\n<p>6. Teach skills in problem solving, algorithmic analysis,      and computational thinking.</p>\n<p>7. Help students learn how to study effectively and how to      access campus academic resources.</p>\n<p>The course, now called COMP 101, was first offered in the fall semester of 2012 to all incoming freshmen who had indicated the intention to declare one of UMBC&rsquo;s computing majors (i.e., Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Information Systems, and Business Technology Administration). It has been offered every fall semester since then, and to date, 237 students have completed the course. Complete graduation data for these students is not yet available, but an analysis of several proxy measures (major switching, GPA, etc.) shows that, in general, students who took COMP 101 are more likely than otherwise similar students to stay in a computing major, although the difference is too small in most cohorts to be statistically significant. However, the effect of the course on retention is especially evident among female students. The data also shows that COMP 101 students are not likely to have higher grades than their peers in following semesters, and that students&rsquo; grades in COMP 101 are less reliable predictors of success in future computing courses than peers&rsquo; grades in other beginning computing courses (primarily initial programming courses).</p>\n<p>Evaluation of COMP 101 also included analysis of significant qualitative data collected through interviews and focus groups. This data shows that COMP 101 students are more likely than their peers to think about future career options, to ask insightful questions about curriculum and career choices, and to reflect on their own preferences and plans with respect to career path. COMP 101 students also learned some of the complexities and challenges of teamwork. They were able to describe and reflect on their teamwork experiences and could apply their experiences to future coursework. Both COMP 101 students and their peers cited programming as a source of anxiety, and led some students to question their suitability for a computing major. However, in retrospect (i.e., in interviews completed several semesters after taking COMP 101), students felt that the programming skills they learned were highly helpful when they took the follow-on programming course. COMP 101 students also were found to understand computing concepts such as algorithmic problem solving and computational thinking in the abstract, but expressed difficulty in applying these concepts to the work they were doing in the course or to other real problems.</p>\n<p>A major outcome of this project, in addition to delivery of COMP 101, is the development of a large cohort of student staff who have served as peer mentors and teaching fellows. These students have reported this experience as extremely valuable because it allowed them to develop communication, teaching, and leadership skills, and helped them to play an important role in fostering community among computing students at UMBC. Many of these students have gone on to other leadership positions in their departments. Finally, another very important outcome of this project is that UMBC has institutionalized the course, committed to offering it to all incoming freshman classes, and hired a full-time lecturer to continue to teach it each fall. Work is ongoing to develop ways to package COMP 101 in another form for new computing transfer students.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/05/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carolyn&nbsp;B&nbsp;Seaman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140589/1140589_10168217_1475657557976_Fall2013COMP101--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140589/1140589_10168217_1475657557976_Fall2013COMP101--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"COMP101 at UMBC\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1140589/1140589_10168217_1475657557976_Fall2013COMP101--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"COMP101 at UMBC\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">COMP101 students creating a physical semantic net</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marie desJardins</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carolyn&nbsp;B&nbsp;Seaman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">COMP101 at UMBC</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
