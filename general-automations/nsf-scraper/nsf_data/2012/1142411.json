 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish proof of concept for enhancing fungal bioinsecticide to control bark beetles, important forestry pests. Although research shows potential of fungal insect pathogens as bark beetle bioinsecticides, no commercial products have been developed.  The short exposure time of adults, inaccessibility of larvae, and limited time to kill before irreversible tree damage makes control difficult. Innovation to overcome these barriers comes from understanding complex interactions between beetles and fungi.  Phase 1 will establish technical, economic, and regulatory feasibility of combining fungal pathogens with fungal metabolites that inhibit beetle boring behavior.  Inhibiting boring would increase efficacy by increasing exposure time of beetles to fungal pathogen spores. Research will define baseline efficacy of the fungal pathogen; identify fungal metabolites that act as boring deterrents; determine commercially scalable production process for selected metabolites; and assess regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are a cost effective, safe and environmentally benign bio-insecticide with substantial commercial potential to replace chemical insecticides now used to protect high value trees and to expand control strategies where chemical insecticides are too expensive or limited by environmental impact.  A climate change exacerbated outbreak of mountain pine beetle (MPB) is devastating western United States and Canadian pine forests, severely impacting to economic and recreational value. The time and cost required to develop a commercial product is favorable as MMP will combine boring inhibitors with an EPA approved, commercially available fungal strain with demonstrated pathogenicity to MPB.",

This report summarizes the phase 1 Small Business Innovation Research project demonstrating proof of concept for controlling the mountain pine beetle (MPB), currently the most devastating forest pest in the western US.  (The phase 1 project was conducted by Montana Microbial Products LLC which transferred the project to MBAI for commercial development.)\n\nClimate change and global commerce are driving unprecedented outbreaks of both native and introduced bark beetles.  Beetle outbreaks devastate forests and urban trees, impacting timber value, urban land values and esthetics of forested public land.  In recent decades, billions of conifer trees across millions of acres in the western US and Canada have been killed by native bark beetles in forests from Mexico to Alaska.  Current outbreaks are among the largest and most severe in recorded history. The US Forest Service estimates that with climate change, 15 native bark beetle species have potential to kill conifers on a landscape scale in the western US.  In the Midwest, the emerald ash borer introduced in the 1990\u00c6s in wood material from China has killed more than 20 million ash trees. Outbreaks of related bark beetles species damage temperate forests in Europe, Asia and South America. \n\nBark beetles are difficult to control.  With a life cycle mostly under tree bark, exposure to insecticides is limited to the short period when adults search for new host trees.  Land managers have limited options for containing outbreaks or protecting trees of economic and esthetic value.  Control measures are limited primarily to removing infested trees and thinning stands.  These measures are expensive, limited in scope and do little to contain outbreaks of the current scale.  \n\nPublic land managers and private land owners now protect high value trees with persistent chemical insecticides or expensive pheromone repellents. Public agencies are under pressure to reduce use of chemical insecticides due to environmental and human health concerns.  Development of cost effective and environmentally benign biological insecticides would provide new tools for protecting high value trees and for managing bark beetle outbreaks. \n\nPhase 1 demonstrated that a naturally occurring strain of the fungal insect pathogen Beauveria bassiana (Bb) was effective against MPB.    Fungi such as Bb occur widely in ecosystems and are important natural control on insect populations.  Spores of the fungi attach to the cuticle of the insect, germinate and grow through the cuticle infecting and killing the insect. These natural insect pathogens are not infective or toxic to humans or animals and different strains are relatively selective in infecting certain insects. This mode of action allows for developing safe, environmentally benign bioinsecticides that have no impact on animals or plants and limited effects on non target insects. \n\nDemonstrating feasibility of Bb for protecting trees from MPB required that spores in formulations applied to tree bark:\n\n1) Contact, infect and kill adult beetles that land, search and bore into the bark,\n\n2) Persist on sprayed trees long enough to be effective over the flight period of adult beetles,\n\n3) Limit damage to the tree sufficient for tree survival, and\n\n4) Meet these criteria when applied at economically competitive rates.\n\nWith discoveries relating to formulation, application methods and persistence of the spores on trees the project demonstrated that:\n\nup to 100% of adult MBP that crawl on bark treated with Bb spores are infected and killed \nspores survive at effective concentration on tree bark for at least 6 weeks under worst case conditions of temperature and sunlight exposure\neffective application rates of spore formulations are cost competitive with chemical insecticides and  cost much less than repellent pheromones now used to protect trees from MBP attack.              ..."
