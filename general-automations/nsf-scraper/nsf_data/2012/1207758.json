 "awd_abstract_narration": "Factorization homology is a homology theory for topological n-manifolds,  constructed as a topological analogue of the homology of a factorization  algebra in the algebro-geometric sense of Beilinson and Drinfeld. The  coefficient system for such a theory is provided by a choice of n-disk  algebra, a structure arising from n-fold loop spaces, Lie algebras, and  certain quantum field theories, among other sources. This project aims to  further develop this relatively new theory, to both bring new techniques to  bear on previously studied invariants and to find new manifold invariants. A  particular focus is 3-manifold topology, where one goal is to express quantum  knot and 3-manifold invariants, such as Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants,  Vassiliev knot invariants, and Chern-Simons invariants, in a uniform way in  terms of factorization homology, and a second goal is to construct new knot  homology theories via factorization homology. Another focus is the relation of  factorization homology to the surgery classification of higher-dimensional  topological manifolds.\r\n\r\nThis project lies in topology, which studies abstract notions of space, motivated by mathematical physics - an intersection which had led to a great  deal of work and cross-pollination. The problems are concerned with what  possible global geometry may exist in a theoretical model for physical space  or space-time and how this global geometry can be detected. It is interesting problem to try to describe the global geometry of such a  candidate model for space-time by local observations. This project is one  approach to this problem. Namely, if one were allowed to make local  observations of some kind at different points throughout space-time, then  compare them, how could one then reconstruct the global geometry from these  compatible collections of observations? Factorization homology, the focus of  this project, provides one avenue toward addressing this question.",
