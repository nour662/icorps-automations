 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Thomas Skinner of Wright State University and his graduate student researchers will be supported to investigate the development of new pulse sequences for use in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy using optimal control methods.  Prof. Skinner and his students will develop robust methods that will work in experiments where other methods fail.  In addition, in this grant period, Prof. Skinner's group will begin to work on developing pulse sequences for use in X-band EPR spectroscopy. \r\n \r\nNMR and EPR spectroscopy are workhorse techniques used by chemists, chemical engineers, materials scientists, medical researchers, and other scientists in  many more fields where determine molecular structures is critical for advancing understanding.  Typically radio-frequency pulses are used to interrogate the sample in these techniques.  Prof. Skinner's group is investigating the creation of new kinds of robust pulse sequences that are less susceptible to the effects of distortion or magnetic field inhomogeneity.  The results of this work will yield new tools that will increase the speed with which these experiments can be done, without introducing artifacts.  The broad dissemination of this work is increased through the continued collaboration with an industry leader in NMR and EPR instrumentation, making the results of this research widely available to a large community of users.  In addition, Prof. Skinner's students are trained in cutting edge methods in a scientific area that shows continued growth, guaranteeing that they will have valuable skills for the scientific/technical workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSome atomic nuclei behave like magnets, i.e., similar to a compass needle. Examples include the nuclei of hydrogen and isotopes such as carbon-13, nitrogen-14, and phosphorous-31.  Electrons also exhibit magnetic properties.  More formally, we say these particles possess a magnetic moment.  These and other nuclei having a magnetic moment provide a wonderful, extremely valuable, and versatile means for noninvasively and nondestructively studying the properties of materials and biological systems. \n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) are important modalities that can extract information from the manipulation of particle magnetic moments by measuring and analyzing the signals they give off.  Interactions between the magnetic moments in a sample being studied provide powerful probes of atomic and molecular structure and dynamics, making NMR one of the most important techniques available for obtaining structural information.  An important application, for example, is the design of effective drugs and pharmaceuticals.  NMR spectroscopy is the prime analytical chemical tool for determining the spatial structure, mobility, and interaction of biological molecules in aqueous solutions.  It is also the premier modality for noninvasive, nondestructive characterization of solid materials. NMR therefore plays a crucial role in a host of important applications in chemistry, biochemistry, materials science, and the medical field.\n\nEPR has similar important applications, but all magnetic resonance experiments require the application of radio frequency pulses to generate a detectable signal. Technical limitations related to pulse generation have prevented EPR from being able to employ the sophisticated techniques developed for NMR.  The essence of our work on this grant is to use our knowledge of the physics underlying NMR and EPR to develop the best pulses for a host of important applications.  There have been special opportunities to improve pulse performance in EPR due to recent technological advances that remove some of the technical limitations mentioned above.  This presented a transformative opportunity to put EPR on a path to rival NMR in its widespread utility.\n\nFor NMR, we have developed pulses of nearly ideal performance that are used to decouple interactions between magnetic moments of different nuclei such as hydrogen and carbon-13.  Such decoupling pulses are a crucial and routine part of a variety of important NMR experiments. Previous pulses produce artifacts that interfere with the accuracy of the experimental results, while our new pulses are artifact-free.  They can be used in any decoupling experiment.  Another set of decoupling pulses was developed specifically for quantitative, noninvasive NMR of living systems.  These pulses allow quantitation of unprecedented accuracy and were developed specifically to measure toxic environmental effects in living systems, although they have more general applications.  We also developed greatly improved pulses that are basic elements of a host of NMR experiments that can be used to improve the performance of any NMR experiment.\n\nFor EPR, we developed pulses that can now be implemented using new technology.  They provide NMR-like performance for EPR, resulting in a radical changeover in the field and opening the door to far more sophisticated EPR performance.  Ever increasing numbers of researchers refer to the growing use of such pulses and their advantages.  Pulses that were previously the standard for EPR use are rapidly being replaced by our pulses, as well as pulses increasingly developed by others responding to our work. \n\nAnother important application for our pulse engineering is to provide tolerance for pulse imperfections.  A common case involves the fidelity of the pulses, which are often applied with the intensity uniformly increased or decreased compared to the ideal intensity. This can be due to imperfections or inhomogeneities caused by the devices that deliver the pulses. We are able to derive pulses that operate equally well over a range of relevant miscalibration in intensity.  An important application considered in this grant is NMR of metals (conductors), which can significantly rescale pulse intensity.  The immediate application for our grant is development of better batteries for energy storage, but there are numerous applications in the field of materials science. \n\nOur research provided scientific training for 5 postdoctoral fellows, 6 graduate students, and 1 undergraduate research project. Valuable scientific interaction was facilitated among the project's junior members and faculty collaborators. Our students and postdocs also had the experience of writing papers and presenting results at scientific meetings and interacting with the larger scientific community.\n\nAs noted, there are numerous disciplines and fields of study in which magnetic resonance plays a vital role.  Our work has been tranformative in its effects.  In addition, it provides a foundation for further ongoing transformative research. Fields such as chemistry, biochemistry, materials science, new energy sources, and medicine are among the beneficiaries, leading to a wealth of benefits for society.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/15/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas E Skinner"
