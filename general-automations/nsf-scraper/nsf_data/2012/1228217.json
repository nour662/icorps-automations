 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose specific methodological advances in three areas of statistical science.  Many conventional statistical methods break down for massive data sets because they do not scale well--- the amount of computational effort or memory increases as a power or even exponentially with problem size.  One area is that of statistical emulation of the output of computer simulation models.  Here the investigators propose to generate adaptive subdesigns automatically, carefully selecting and using only the small subset of the data that bears on each specific computational goal; and to develop what they call \"parallel partial emulation\" in which emulation is performed simultaneously in parallel with some model inputs kept at a range of fixed values.  A second area is that of multiple scale stochastic models, exploiting infinitely-divisible distributions for some model features to permit coupled parallel analyses at a range of scales, with coarser scales requiring less computational effort and running faster to help the finer scales reach equilibrium faster.  A third area is dynamic evolution models in which computational effort is focused on those aspects that change most rapidly, while other aspects are treated as slowly-varying or piecewise-constant.  All methods are applied to the same important application area, the quantitative assessment of geophysical hazard for volcanic events.\r\n\r\nThe investigators propose to develop new mathematical, statistical, and computational methods to address the problem of making principled statistical inference on the basis of massive data sets.  The new methods are developed and applied in the context of a specific important societal problem: improving methods for the quantitative assessment of risk associated with volcanic activity.  In this application area the product of this research would be maps indicating which areas face specified levels of hazard (say, 1000:1, 100:1, 10:1) for specified lengths of time (say, 1 month, 1 year, 1 decade), with estimates based on geophysical evidence and validated computational models.  The methods are applicable in other areas of modern empirical science--- both for making quantitative assessments of other geophysical hazards and, more broadly, other scientific endeavors with large amounts of data.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPyroclastic 'broken fire' flows are not what most people think of when they think about volcanoes.  These extremely fast moving flows comprised of rock fragments, debris, and hot gas are effectively volcanic avalanches that can completely devastate nearby communities.  These volcanic avalanches can, without much warning, be much larger (more flowing debris, longer run-outs, potentially more devastating impacts on the surrounding community) than previous flow events from the same volcano.\n\nProbabilistic hazard maps--- maps where colors at various locations reflect the probability of each location being devastated by geophysical events over say the next 6 months, 1 year, or 10 years--- might well be compared to weather forecasts.  A location up valley, for instance, may have an 80% chance of being inundated by a volcanic avalanche over the next year while a location down valley may have only a 10% chance.  A probabilistic hazard map is a spatial compilation of these probabilities.\n\nThis group has constructed the very first fully probabilistic hazard maps for pyroclastic flows from dome-collapse volcanoes.  This represents an enormous advance in probabilistic hazard assessment for the geosciences. The approach developed in this project is superior in a variety of ways to the previous state of the art.  In that standard approach previously known events were treated as random events that might happen in the future.  This approach was both computationally inefficient and failed to accurately\nreflect the chance that a catastrophic event might occur.\n\nUltimately these maps are made by combining probabilistic models of scenarios (how large?  what initial direction?) with the output of a physical model (here of flowing mass).  The physical model is solved on a super computer and run under many different scenarios.  This is a both a computational and data intensive problem.  Through the work in this project, our group has developed efficient strategies to combine the available data with physical models.  Furthermore, the approach is not specific to volcanic hazards, and thus could be applied to a wide variety of geophysical and industrial hazards.\n\nThis new methodology allows for rapid and computationally efficient analysis of many factors affecting the flow; it makes real-time hazard assessments possible.  It allows users to incorporate as much information as possible to reflect the current of knowledge about the behavior of the volcano (albeit random behavior).  Furthermore, it allows some details about likely scenarios to be modified frequently as an eruption progresses, and as our understanding of it improves.  It also provides a much-improved ability to account for and to quantify uncertainty.  These are all issues that currently hamper real-world hazard analysis undertaken by geoscientists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Abani K Patra"
