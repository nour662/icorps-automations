It consists of computational resources in the form of an SGI UV 1000 machine with 384 cores and four Tesla M2070 GPUs, and a small cluster composed of 32 nodes (384 cores total), each with two Tesla M2070 GPUs; and disk resources in the form of solid-state storage cards and an Isilon Storage Cluster. The instrumentation supports projects in various domains. The computer science projects include \r\n-\tDataflow architectures, \r\n-\tTheoretical models of computation, \r\n-\tWeb search, \r\n-\tVisualization, and \r\n-\tData mining; \r\nWhile the application area research projects (undertaken with external collaborators) relate to\r\n-\tWildfire simulation, \r\n-\tBird migration simulation, and \r\n-\tClimate science. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe team plans to release the software developed as part of this project as open source, which carries potential for significant broader impact. The involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in the project provides mentoring opportunities.",
