 "awd_abstract_narration": "1235900\r\nSchultz\r\n\r\nAntidepressant pharmaceuticals are one of the most heavily prescribed pharmaceutical products in the United States.  Human pharmaceuticals enter wastewater treatment and, subsequently, the environment, primarily by way of domestic waste from human excretion or by direct disposal of unused or expired drugs in toilets.  Since antidepressants are widely prescribed in the United States and are incompletely removed during municipal wastewater treatment, it is not surprising that these chemicals are being measured in our waterways.  Antidepressants and select degradates have been reported in wastewater effluent and in effluent-receiving surface waters at nanogram to low microgram per liter range.  The presence and potential accumulation of pharmaceutically active compounds, including antidepressants, poses a great threat to non-target organisms that live in environments that receive continuous exposure of antidepressants via wastewater discharge.  Laboratory and field studies confirm that non-target organisms, such as fish that live in wastewater effluent receiving waters, can accumulate antidepressants in their tissues.  Laboratory exposure studies report that there are behavioral and physiological consequences of antidepressant exposure on these non-target organisms.   Most research regarding the fate and transport of antidepressants in the environment has focused on aquatic systems.  The primary objectives of this research are to measure the fate, transport, and the potential for bioaccumulation of antidepressants in terrestrial environments considering wastewater treatment technologies that may remediate and reduce their subsequent loads into the environment. Specific aims include: (i) to determine the occurrence, distribution, and fate of antidepressants in biosolids and biosolids-amended soils (ii) investigate the bioaccumulation of antidepressants in earthworms living in biosolid-amended soils, and (iii) explore the potential for remediation of antidepressants during sludge treatment.\r\n\r\nPublic and regulatory interest regarding the presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment is increasing. Antidepressants are environmental contaminants of particular concern because they are widely dispensed, are bioactive (including many of their degradation products), are common wastewater contaminants, and have been shown to cause adverse effects in organisms living in wastewater-impacted environments.  This project will investigate the role wastewater treatment plants plays in introducing antidepressants to terrestrial environments, while exploring wastewater treatment plants remediation technologies that could reduce their environmental loads. Results from this study will assist our understanding of the relationship between wastewater treatment and the fate, transport, and possible bioaccumulation of antidepressants from biosolids to terrestrial environments, an area of research that is currently understudied.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     Antidepressants are among the most widely prescribed drugs in a class of compounds known as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). In recent years, increasing evidence has shown that many PPCPs including antidepressants are found in the natural environment at concentrations in the parts per billion-concentration range.  Antidepressant compounds enter natural ecosystems due to incorrect disposal of prescription medications, and incomplete removal of the compounds during the process of wastewater treatment.  The contaminated wastewater effluent is then released into local streams and rivers and/or biosolid material is applied to agricultural crops as fertilizer.  Non-target organisms such as aquatic and terrestrial plants and animals may then experience chronic low-level exposure to antidepressants in the natural environment resulting in the accumulation of such compounds in their tissues.  The research outlined in this project addressed three major goals: a) to quantify the amount of various antidepressants in the natural environment, b) to determine if bioaccumulation of antidepressants was occurring in non-target organisms and c) to identify biochemical processes that facilitate the degradation of antidepressants for the purpose of bioremediation.\n\n     Our studies suggest that as a society, we must carefully consider the potential impact of low-level contaminants in the environment.   We have shown that several different types of antidepressants are accumulating to detectable levels in the natural environment (water and soil) and in aquatic (fish) and terrestrial organisms (plants and earthworms).  Furthermore this research has indicated that metabolic stress is likely occurring in some organisms that show accumulation of antidepressants, though the long-term physical and behavioral consequences of this metabolic stress have yet to be determined. \n\n     More complete removal of environmental contaminants could occur during the process of wastewater treatment, such that the released water and biosolid material is free of antidepressant contamination.  Bioremediation, or the use of biological organisms to facilitate the degradation of environmental contaminants such as antidepressants is promising.  We investigated organisms from two bacterial genera Bacillus, and Pseudomonas for the biochemical capability to metabolize compounds with a molecular structure similar to that found in many antidepressant compounds.  Our research has identified a promising metabolic pathway in Bacillus and we have discovered a unique byproduct that is produced during the breakdown of a target compound.  This research may point to chemical pathways that could be specifically engineered to better support the degradation of antidepressants during the wastewater treatment process.  This in turn would lead to better water quality and preservation of our environmental resources.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephanie Strand"
