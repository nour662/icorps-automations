 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the role of gender in the choice of whether or not to run for political office.  In the U.S. many fewer women run for political office than men.  Despite the normative importance of this gender gap and the fact that these differences have garnered much attention from political scientists, we still know very little about what explains these differences or why they persist.  Previous research has relied on observational studies, such as surveys of public officeholders, where self-reports and sample selection problems prevent clear inferences regarding gender differences.  To overcome these problems, this study uses experimental methods to control for confounding factors that affect the relative propensities for women and men to enter politics.  Preliminary evidence indicates that there are gender differences in choices to run for office, with women less likely to run than men with similar abilities, and that these differences are specific to the competitive and strategic context of campaigns and elections.\r\n\r\nWith regards to broader impacts, the results of this research could have important benefits to society and policymakers.  Understanding gender differences in choices to enter politics will help design policies that draw on the abilities of all our citizens for the betterment of our nation.",

Also, our laboratory setting allows us to measure candidate quality, which we can use to determine which candidates are the best at the job that will be filled via the election. Most notably, our findings point to three broad conclusions. First, women are much less likely to stand for election than are men, even absent external forces that we think might make women less likely than men to run. Second, men and women volunteer for the job at similar rates; the difference comes only when an election is held to fill the position. This finding tells us that it is neither lack of confidence nor aversion to risk that explains gender differences in willingness to run. This is important because much of our previous understanding of why women don&rsquo;t run focused on the question of confidence. We find, however, that women are perfectly confident when they are asked to volunteer to do a job: It is the election itself that turns them away. And third, we find that women are more sensitive to institutional context than are men. If elections are perfectly informative AND they are low-cost, women are about as likely to run as men are. In other words, gender-based election aversion is mitigated. But if either (or both) of those factors is not true, women run less than do men.

Rather, we find that women and men approach the question of whether or not to run differently, with men running when they think they are good at the task, whereas women run when they think they are the best. In this way, then, we can explain gender differences in willingness to run with the argument that women have set the qualifications &ldquo;bar&rdquo; higher than do men.
