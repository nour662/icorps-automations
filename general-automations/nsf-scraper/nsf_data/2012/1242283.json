 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one day workshop on \"Research Directions in the \r\nPrinciples of Parallel Computing\" is scheduled on June 28, 2012 at \r\nCarnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh, PA.  The workshop will \r\nbring together researchers from academia and industry to inform, \r\ndiscuss, and initiate collaborations on understanding the key research \r\nchallenges in the foundations of parallel computing, and directions to \r\npossibly address these challenges.  The emphasis of the workshop is on \r\ntheoretical approaches to parallel computation and how to bridge these \r\napproaches with practice.  It will be held the day after the ACM \r\nSymposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA), which \r\nis to be held June 25-27, 2012 also at CMU. \r\n \r\nThe workshop will address several issues described in NSF's Advanced \r\nComputing Infrastructure Strategic Plan including, but not limited to, \r\ncomputational models, programming languages, rethinking the canonical \r\ncomputing \"stack\" and new algorithmic paradigms.  The workshop will \r\nconsist of approximately 20 invited speakers who will be asked to \r\npresent their thoughts on \"what are three big research challenges in \r\nthe principles of parallel computing\".  Attendance to the workshop is \r\nopen to all students, faculty and industry researchers at no charge (as \r\nspace permits).  The output of the workshop will be a public report \r\ndocumenting the discussions.  It is hoped this report and other \r\ninteractions at the workshop will have broad impact on future \r\ndirections of research in the theory and practice of parallel \r\ncomputation.",
