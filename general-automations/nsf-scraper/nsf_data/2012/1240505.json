ICSM provided a premier international (world wide) venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the area of software maintenance and evolution.  ICSM conference is a vital venue for the community of researchers and practitioners to publish, present, and debate the latest results advancing state of the art in software maintenance and evolution.  The grant was used to support and broaden student participation in ICSM 2012 and ICSM 2013 by subsidizing the travel for participants who might not otherwise travel to attend the conference.  The funds were used solely to provide travel support for students from the U.S. based institutions.\n\n \n\nThis proposal notably augmented both the training and development of graduate students working in the area of software maintenance and evolution by attending these conferences.  The students receiving travel support personally benefited from the chance to engage in the important technical professional and social opportunities that ICSM 2012 and ICSM 2013 fostered.  Moreover, the conferences were indirectly strengthened as a result of the greater attendance that this travel support provided.
