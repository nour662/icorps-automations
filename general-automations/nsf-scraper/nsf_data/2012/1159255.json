 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pacifici\r\n1159255\r\nLeveraging recent progress in plasmonics and nanophotonics, the aim of the proposed research is to develop a dense, planar array of nanoscale plasmonic interferometers for real-time, sensitive, multiplexed, and high-throughput characterization of a variety of cytokines released, e.g., in polytrauma patients. The novelty of the concept being proposed is a new design for multi-wavelength plasmonic interferometry coupled to surface chemistries that are specific to cytokines in order to provide the required selectivity. The result will be a large, dense array of plasmonic interferometers that, while retaining the ultimate sensitivity, could expand the capabilities of current SPR techniques to include broad-band wavelength detection, for specific analyte fingerprinting, and high-throughput characterization, via integration of more than one million SPR-equivalent sensors per square centimeter in a single chip.  In addition to a better understanding of light-matter interaction at the nanoscale, the proposed research will dramatically impact the throughput capabilities of several analyses and assays relevant to human health and currently used in the life sciences, and serve as an alternative high-throughput scheme for faster drug discovery, as well as more efficient identification and screening of novel therapies. The proposed research will also provide graduate-level training of students in areas of national need, with particular attention to attracting and retaining underrepresented minorities and women in science and engineering. In addition to the education outreach to local schools, the PIs will recruit a high school summer student to perform sensing experiments using the proposed plasmonic interferometry approach.",
