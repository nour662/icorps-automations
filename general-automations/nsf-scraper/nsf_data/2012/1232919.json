 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF grant provides partial support for attendees of the 2012 Gordon Conference on Tribology - Paths of Dissipation, to be held July 8 - 13, 2012 at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, USA.  Tribology, the study of friction, wear and lubrication, is an extremely complex and multi-disciplinary field that involves processes over a wide range of size and time scales from atomic interactions to entire machines.  The biennial Gordon Research Conference on Tribology is a unique forum for gathering experts in disparate fields to advance our understanding of the complex problems tribology presents.  Leading scientists and engineers from universities, national laboratories and industry meet with young scientists and newcomers to tribology for one week of formal and informal discussions on state-of-the art issues.  This opportunity for a lively and open exchange of new ideas shapes the future of the field.  Addressing many of the great challenges in tribology will require an improved understanding of dissipation mechanisms.  There remains a large gap between the scales considered by computer simulations and experiments and the dissipation mechanisms they reveal, as well as between atomistic perspectives and applied tribology.  The 2012 Gordon Research Conference will highlight the coincidences and discrepancies between experiments and simulations and changes in dissipation mechanisms across the many orders of magnitude in time and length scale.\r\n\r\nTribology affects nearly every aspect of our daily lives and technology.  Improved understanding of the paths of dissipation is expected to have a profound impact on applications in aircraft and car engines, production technology, hip and knee joints, shrinking devices to micro- and nanometer scales, and expanding the range of temperatures, speeds, and chemical environments where such devices operate.  The Gordon Conference is a key mechanism for linking the basic sciences with an engineering discipline of significant importance to the US and world economies.  Tribology advances require a constant input of new ideas between these researchers and disciplines.  The conference also provides opportunities for young investigators, students, and those new to tribology to learn from those with a deep understanding of tribological problems and cutting edge approaches.  This NSF grant provides support for conference fees and/or travel expenses that will enable key participants to attend the Gordon Conference.  The conference organizers will strive for gender balance and also favor under-represented ethnic minority or disabled individuals that apply.  Support from this grant will play a particularly important role in allowing attendance of students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty that otherwise be unable to participate due to lack of funds.",
