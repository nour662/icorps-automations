 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on optimizing the design of a\r\nrobot for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Research has shown that children\r\nwith ASD interact more easily with inanimate devices, such as robots, than with humans.\r\nDespite this promising research, there are currently no consumer robots on the market\r\nspecifically designed to interact with ASD children. The goal of this research is to investigate\r\nwhat set of features are optimal for a robot designed to be an effective and affordable therapy\r\ntool for children with ASD. Initial designs will be generated based on existing research and\r\npreviously conducted user tests. These designs will be used to create prototypes which will then\r\nbe used to conduct user studies with ASD children to determine which designs elicit the\r\ngreatest engagement, measured by proximity to robot, number of interactions (physical & eye\r\ncontact), duration of interactions and number of vocalizations. The expected results are a\r\nvalidated design of an affordable consumer-ready robot that addresses the specific needs of\r\nchildren with ASD.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project involve both the direct impact of\r\nproviding a beneficial new therapy tool for children with ASD as well as providing a platform\r\nfrom which additional research can be launched. The CDC currently estimates that 1 in 88\r\nchildren in the United States will be diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder and ASDs\r\nare reported to occur in all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Early intervention can\r\nmake a significant difference in the lives of these children and their families. Tools that allow\r\nchildren to practice and reinforce skills learned in formal therapy sessions are strongly desired\r\nby parents. The goal of this project is to develop a validated design for a robot to help children\r\nwith ASD practice social referencing skills. By designing both for effectiveness and\r\naffordability, it will be the first autism robot targeted towards the home therapy market.\r\nAdditionally, the results of this project will also be beneficial to researchers studying the use of\r\nrobots as autism therapy tools. This robot will serve as an affordable alternative to expensive\r\nresearch robots, most of which were not designed specifically to interact with special needs\r\nchildren.",
