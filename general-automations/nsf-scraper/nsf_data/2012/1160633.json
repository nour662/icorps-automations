 "awd_abstract_narration": "Banach spaces, their geometric and topological structure, provide a natural framework for studying dynamical systems, differential equations, physics, and signal analysis.  A main theme of this proposal is the investigation of certain \"coordinate systems\" for Banach spaces, e.g. bases, frames, and dictionaries. One of the problems considered is an old one from harmonic analysis, which asks whether the space of p-integrable functions on the real line has a basis formed by translates of the same element. It is intended to attack this problem with tools from the theory of Banach spaces. Another prominent problem is the embedding of Banach spaces into Banach spaces with an additional structure, for example into Banach spaces with very few operators. The principal investigator intends to bring to bear here the method of infinite asymptotic games, which he developed in collaboration with E. Odell. A particularly important problem, especially in the context of the famous invariant subspace problem, is the question whether there are reflexive spaces with very few operators.\r\n \r\nThe principal investigator intends to work on longstanding problems in the structure theory of Banach spaces, many of them either originating from, or being related to other area of mathematics such as applied areas like signal processing and data compression or rather theroretical areas like set theory, harmonic analysis, and approximation theory. The techniques to be employed will involve a combination of analysis, geometry, infinite combinatorics, and logic. The proposed work could also spur further development in these latter areas.  Several parts of this proposal deal with issues originating in signal processing and data compression. Here one looks for bases, frames, or, more generally dictionaries of spaces, in which (certain) vectors can be approximated by vectors with few non zero coordinates, using easily implementable algorithms, so that the representation satisfies certain stability conditions. Recent work on band limited functions by the investigator generated an interesting and potentially fruitful line of investigation in the interface between convex geometry and harmonic analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "During the period 05/01//2015 to 04/30/2016 the principal  investigator worked mainly on two research  projects:\n\n1) Metric spaces are often used in Computer Science to model large data sets, and the   objective of this project  is to investigate embeddings of  metric spaces into Banach spaces, and to obtain on the one hand information about the structure of the metric space, from the property that it embeds in certain Banach spaces and on the other hand deduce   geometrical properties of a Banach space, from the property, that certain metric embed or do not embed  in it.  During the reporting period the PI continued to work on the project (started in 2014) to find metric characterizations of  isomorphic properties  of Banach spaces.  In September 2015 Pavlos Motakis, a  postdoctoral fellow, joint him on that project.   They concentrated on finding metric descriptions of the reflexivity of a separable Banach space, and metric descriptions of the class of Banach spaces whose Szlenk index is bounded by  some countable ordinal &alpha;. The two main results obtained are stated as follows.\nFor every countable ordinal &alpha; two metrics d(1,&alpha;) and  d(&infin;,&alpha;) on the  Schreier family S(&alpha;) were defined,  so that the following holds:\nA separable Banach space X is not reflexive if and only if  there is a number c&gt;0 and for all countable ordinals &alpha;, there are maps &Psi;: S(&alpha;)&rarr;X  so that for all A and B in S(&alpha;):\n   c d(&infin;,&alpha;)(A,B)&le;||&Psi;(A)- &Psi;(B)||&le; d(1,&alpha;)(A,B).\nMoreover, for a reflexive sparable Banach space X and a countable ordinal &alpha;, it followows that the Szlenk index of X is larger than &alpha; if and only if there is a bi-Lipschitz map from the metric space  (S(&alpha;), d(1,&alpha;)) into X.\nThe results were written up and a preliminary draft  can be obtained from the arXive (arXiv:1604.07271). The paper  will soon be submitted to a journal.\n \n2) In the theory of signal and image processing, greedy algorithm play an important role because they allow an easy and fast reconstruction.  \nWith Stephen Dilworth, Smbat  Gogyan, and Denka Kutzarova, the greedy algorithm on the space of  integrable functions on [0,1] wih respect to the Haarbasis was considered and it was  analyized why it does  not converge, or, equivalently why the threshold operator is not bounded.
