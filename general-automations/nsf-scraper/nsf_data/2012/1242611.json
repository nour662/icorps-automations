 "awd_abstract_narration": "The existence of dark matter is known from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility motivated by other considerations in elementary particle physics is that dark matter consists of undiscovered elementary particles; Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are one possibility. Evidence for WIMPs that could constitute dark matter may come from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN or from sensitive astronomical instruments that detect radiation produced by WIMP-WIMP annihilations in galaxy halos. The orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nuclear collisions of sufficient energy to be observable by sensitive laboratory apparatus. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide funding for research and development steps to support DarkSide-G2, a second-generation (\"G2\") direct WIMP search using a liquid argon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with an active mass of 3.3 tons. Liquid argon is a promising medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (\"pulse shape\") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. This is one of the most powerful background rejection factors among all dark matter detectors, and when combined with the measurement of ionization, background rejection is even further enhanced. The performance of a ton-scale or larger liquid argon TPC would be limited by the high rate of 39-Ar beta decays if atmospheric argon was used. DarkSide-G2 will use argon collected from underground sources which has been shown to have 39-Ar content lower than atmospheric argon by at least a factor of 150. These funds will allow the groups to carry out the detailed mechanical design work necessary to ensure the functionality of the detector, develop necessary high voltage and data acquisition elements, and develop and identify the extremely radiopure detector components and techniques necessary to maximize the sensitivity of the experiment.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission in a variety of ways: (1) it will offer a continuing opportunity for the training of students, who will have a chance to contribute a cutting-edge project in fundamental science and advanced engineering; (2) it will benefit society by developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging; and (3) it will support continued development of successful E&O programs such as the LNGS-South Dakota-Princeton summer school for high school students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was to specify and acquire two semi-custom commercial instruments for use in connection with Dark Matter searches and other sensitive low-background counting experiments. Modifications for both instruments needed to bring them into compliance with our experimental requirements were successfully developed, in partnership with their U.S. vendors.  Both instruments have been successfully tested and delivered.  Undergraduate students as well as graduate students and other faculty from underrepresented minority groups (two females, one African-American) have been directly involved in the work. \n\n \n\nThe first instrument was a High Purity Germanium Detector (HPGe)  for measuring nuclear radiation with high sensitivity.  This instrument is used to test candidate materials for building low background experiments, to insure that the materials are free of natural radioactivity at levels that would interfere with the low background measurement.  It can also be used for sensitive measurements of e.g. environmental samples to study the prevalence and movement of natural radioactivity in the water table, etc.  This instrument was acquired after working closely with the manufacturer to insure that the HPGe internal parts were free of natural radioactivity.  The device has been put into service and shows very low background and hence high sensitivity, better than published results from other laboratories.\n\n \n\nThe second instrument was a radiation generator producing neutrons.  This device is used to provide neutron radiation for calibrating sensitive detectors specific to neutrons or neutron-like radiation detection.  It can also be used to study the effects of neutron radiation on materials or living cells.  This instrument had to be modified from its commercial configuration to allow it to work stably at greatly reduced neutron output intensity.  This was necessary to make it usable for accurate calibration our highly sensitive but rather slow Dark Matter detectors.  The device also had to be modified to make it fit in the very confined space available for calibration devices in our Dark Matter experiment.  This device has also been tested and meets our specifications.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/09/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: C. J. Martoff"
