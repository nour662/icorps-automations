 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Selective C-H Functionalization (CCHF) will develop new reactions and synthetic methodologies for activating and functionalizing carbon-hydrogen bonds. The carbon-hydrogen bond has traditionally been considered inert, but recent advances have shown that this bond can be productively exploited.  A multi-faceted research team will build the mechanistic understanding required for the development of next-generation, selective catalysts and will develop predictive models for determining site selectivity in complex target synthesis. New catalysts systems and new methods for C-H modification will be challenged and refined in the context of natural product synthesis, library preparation and drug discovery, and materials preparation. Selective C-H bond functionalization will also be extensively investigated and further evolved for the single-step tailoring of the structure and physical properties of known molecules.\r\n\r\nThe field of C-H functionalization is projected to impact the fine chemicals industry, with the potential of revolutionizing synthetic strategies targeting pharmaceuticals and materials. By collaboration and partnership with industry leaders and other major research centers, CCHF will ensure the translation of discoveries in basic research to commercial innovations. A Center-wide commitment to continuing educating of the chemical community on the synthetic potential of this new chemistry will facilitate the development of innovations that lie beyond the scope of the proposed research. The Center also will take an active role in reaching out beyond the chemistry community to engage young students, the public, and underrepresented audiences in developing an understanding of and appreciation for the chemical sciences. Through a novel \"Chemistry Communications\" program, CCHF will educate and train their scientists on the best practices in communicating science to different audiences. Products generated by this program such as blogs, science animations, and science journalism will serve to educate different audiences (general public, high school teachers, K-12 students) about CCHF's research discoveries, placing the Center in a unique position to make a positive impact on the perception of chemistry in the Nation and the inclusion of more diversity in people pursuing careers in chemistry. Course development, research opportunities, and research partnerships will further enhance the influence that the Center will have on the engagement of students and underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\nThe Center for Selective C-H Functionalization is funded as part of the Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) program.",

As a primarily catalytic transformation only very small amounts of high value reagents (catalysts) are required to convert large amounts of feedstock chemicals into essential commodities. 2). Employing a CH bond as the reaction partner removes the need for introduction or inter-conversion of functional groups, significantly expanding the scope of feedstock chemicals available for reaction and thus 3). considerably reducing the number of operations required to achieve a desired molecular change. 4).
