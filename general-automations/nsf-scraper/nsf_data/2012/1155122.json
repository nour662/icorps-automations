 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's request funding to develop a low power, autonomous solid state sensor for simultaneous measurement of seawater pH and Total Alkalinity. The proposed research involves micro sensor development, electrochemistry, marine chemistry, and electrical engineering. Combination of two ISFET measurement principles will be used for rapid, sequential measurement of pH and Total Alkalinity in order to generate a full thermodynamic description of the CO2 system in the analyte solution.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:     \r\n\r\nMaking sensors to measure pH and total alkalinity in real time and at the appropriate precision is important to our understanding of ocean acidification. If successful, they plan to commercialize it. Other situations where total weak acid or base concentration in combination with the pH form useful information, this proposed system might be used, like in food industry and for biomedical applications. Two graduate students will be involved in this project.",
