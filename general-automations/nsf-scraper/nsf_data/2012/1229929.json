Characterization of the wireless communication links is needed for FDA regulatory review of medical devices integrated with smart phones. The purpose of the project is to establish a testing procedure for evaluating mobile communication required for transport of medical information, using a range of wireless devices from simple 3G cellular phones to leading smart phone platforms. The research is conducted in two phases, the first one in an anechoic chamber where statistical measures of connectivity from a medical device to the phone are performed. In the second phase, a set of test procedures in specific natural environments that incorporate base station communication are generated.",
