These institutions have a longstanding partnership in increasing the number of underrepresented minority students who earn the doctoral degree that dates back to 2003. However, since 2007, this partnership has been formalized through a memorandum of understanding that includes a focus on collaborations among faculty at both institutions. It is expected that the pilot workshop will provide a foundation upon which more meaningful and deliberate investigation of Hispanic women in the academic STEM disciplines can be examined. The workshop is characterized by relevant plenary and group breakout sessions that will provide attendees with the opportunity to better define the course of study on Latina STEM faculty and determine pathways to broader and future emphases as it relates to this target population.",
