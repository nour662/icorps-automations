 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study examines how interdisciplinary groups of scientists collaborate to produce explanations that are highly integrative and original. This intellectual process, which is called synthesis, has the potential to transform fields of science and to address challenges concerning environment, energy, and other matters. It does so by integrating theories, methods, or data across disciplines, professional sectors, or spatial and temporal scales to produce explanations that are deeply original and exceptionally broad in applicability. Synthesis is important to science and society, but the organizational and social conditions necessary to achieve it are not well understood, and so the ability to manage them is limited. This project uses sociometric sensor badges, a new research technology for the study of small group behavior, in combination with well-established methods in social studies of science, small-group research, sociology, and organizational behavior, to examine how patterns of group organization and interaction influence performance and creativity. \r\n\r\nStudies of small groups, particularly groups of scientists, tend to rely on observation.  Valuable as this is, observation is necessarily limited by the observer's attention or focus and tends to produce qualitative data.  Sociometric sensors can complement observation by revealing new facets of group dynamics and measuring them precisely and unobtrusively, and can also tap the affective dimension of collaboration. Sociometric sensors, and the new insights into group behavior they will produce, may transform studies of collaboration, synthesis, and emotion in science, and advance research in related fields. \r\n\r\nInterdisciplinary synthesis and innovation are vital for addressing societal problems, and policies to encourage synthesis are high on the national science agenda. By improving our understanding of synthesis and our methods for studying it, this project will lay a strong empirical foundation for better policies, decisions, and organizational practices concerning collaboration, interdisciplinarity, and synthesis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScience is organized into small, close-knit groups that work together to produce new knowledge.  We are interested in how such groups work, particularly how they work when members come from a variety of scientific fields and from fields outside the sciences and engineering.  This matters for two reasons:  (1) some of the most powerful transformations in science happen when ideas are transmitted across disciplinary lines (such as when physicists entered the life sciences and catalyzed the powerful new field of molecular biology) and (2) some of the most pressing societal challenges (climate change, disease, innovation, sustainability) can only be remedied through the collaborative efforts of very diverse and highly focused groups.  We are interested in how such groups work, and we studied their behavior using sociometric sensors, which are new instruments to measuring social interaction.  We are also interested in the quality of the publications such groups produced, and so we developed a new way to compare the published work of different groups.\n\nWe found that effective scientific collaborations are emotionally intense, and that the intensity rises and falls in the course of a day and over the days of the collaboration.  We also found that moments of emotional intensity are associated with important scientific outcomes.  Our study of scientific publications showed that groups working in synthesis centers produced publications that were more varied and balanced than those in the reference literature, which suggests that their ways of working together lead to effective new knowledge.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward J Hackett"
