 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective\r\nThe aim is to create a revolutionary monolithic, narrow linewidth, THz technology which is compact, mass-producible, and has mW-scale power output at room temperature.  This will be achieved by optimizing intrinsic nonlinearities in quantum cascade lasers, reducing absorption and phase-matching losses, improving pump power and spectral purity, and improving the device geometry for better THz outcoupling.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed effort combines basic science with advanced technology in order to produce a multi-component, yet highly integrated and functional, device.  The building blocks of the high power THz source represent many active areas of investigation including: high power, dual frequency quantum cascade lasers based on two-dimensional diffractive feedback, band structure engineering of nonlinearity in a quantum system, and investigation of plasmon waveguides and surface gratings. The proposed research also makes an excellent case study for how theory, technology, and experiment all play a role in developing a single integrated device.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThis proposal addresses critical needs in the field of THz light generation at room temperature.  There is also significant potential for follow-on work to explore electrical tunability of the source.  Besides improving spectroscopy and imaging efforts, the biggest impact of a compact, mass-producible THz source will be ease of access, which will enable new research and applications to be developed in diverse fields.\r\nTo increase the lasting impact of this work, educational and outreach activities are stressed which include hands-on training of undergraduates and high-school students.",

Building on initial low power demonstrtaions, this research focused on developing techniques to scale output power through band structure engineering and 2-D photonic crystal feedback. A secondary goal was to increase THz outcoupling efficiency using diffraction gratings.  The net effect was a tremendous increase in THz output power (by a factor of 5), and demonstration of vertical THz emission over a wide area.\n Our approach overcomes many basic problems with existing THz sources.  It is small, operates at room temperature (no cryogenic cooling) , and the output frequency is flexible.  As such, it can be a drop-in replacement for existing THz sources in many imaging or spectroscopic applications. \n In almost all conceivable applications (e.g. spectroscopy, security, communications), the higher power output that has been demonstrated will be extremely useful.  Commercialy availableTHz sources are very low power or are very large.  This extra power will be used to increase range and sensitivty for future compact THz systems. Also, this source has significant potential for mass production; the source can be made cheaply on a wafer scale, similar to other semiconductor lasers.  This will allow many more people access to THz sources for novel and unique research.\n With regard to intellectual merit, this research makes an excellent case study for how theory, technology, and experiment all play a role in developing a single integrated device.  Many publications have come out of this work, and the basic elements (band structure engineering, waveguide and design) have been expanded into to new research efforts.
