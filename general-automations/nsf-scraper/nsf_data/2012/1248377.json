 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will demonstrate the technological and commercial feasibility of using piezoelectric composite materials as spinal fusion implants capable of providing electrical stimulation. Previous researchers have attempted to use piezoelectric materials in the body; however they have often relied on hard and brittle ceramic materials that are not well suited to the environment found inside the human body. Initial studies also did not incorporate the electronic circuitry required to convert the power generated by a piezoelectric material into a form the body is capable of using. Furthermore, the thickness of piezoelectric materials is typically limited due to the need to pole the specimens. This step requires the use of large electric field strengths, which for thick specimens require prohibitively large voltage sources, making it difficult to produce the thicknesses required for a fusion cage. An innovation developed as a result of previous NSF funding has resulted in a manufacturing technique capable of producing large scale piezoelectric composites that are suitable for implantation.\r\n\r\nThis research will result in the creation of an implant that could drastically improve the lives of patients suffering from low back pain. In a market that is currently dominated by commodity products, this could be a truly disruptive technology that fulfills a large patient need. Current adjunct therapies are effective but add tremendous cost and have substantial negative side effects. The piezoelectric fusion implant should be yield success rates comparable to a regular implant plus adjunct therapy, result in fewer negative side effects, and reduce overall patient healthcare costs. Furthermore, the tough piezoelectric composite technology can also be used for many other applications both in and outside of healthcare, and allows the creation of large scale, tough piezoelectric structures previously not considered possible.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     The project \"I-Corps: Spine Fusion Implant made from a Tough Piezoelectric Composite Biomaterial\" was part of the NSF I-Corps program to help university researchers learn how to discern the commercial viability of their technology and help them translate it out to the public.  Our product concept coming into the program did not change, but our concept of how the product could be brought to market was altered dramatically. \n\n     The proposed product concept was a spine fusion implant made out of a novel piezoelectric composite material that will generate bone healing electrical stimulation each time the patient moves without use of a battery or an additional surgery site.  Currently, failure rates of spinal fusion are very high, especially for smokers and diabetics.  These \"difficult to fuse\" patients suffer up to 50 percent failure of the fusion procedure.  Electrical stimulation has been used in commercially available products for over 20 years to help these patients heal.  It has shown very good clinical success, but is not used widely because of the added cost and need for a second surgery site for current battery-based products.  Our piezoelectric spinal fusion implant will eliminate the additional expensive therapies and will reduce costs and patient suffering associated with clinical failure of fusion. \n\n\n     Intellectual Merit:  Through the NSF I-Corps program, our team learned how incredibly important the regulatory aspects of our product concept were in terms of how it could be taken forward.  We learned how we could include regional manufacturing partnerships and then OEM to large implant companies that have established distribution networks.  We learned how to use the concept of the minimum viable product to explain the concept to surgeons so as to more quickly overcome preconceived misconceptions about the use of the product. \n\n\n     Broader Impacts:  We are currently taking the knowledge we earned from the work of the I-Corps program to go forward with the technology and product concept.  Our goal is to translate this product concepts so as to improve patient treatment outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs.  The PI has also implemented the Business Model Canvas in one of her upper level engineering courses.  In this way, engineering students can be exposed to this logical method for validating customer needs and framing the pathway for future entrepreneurial developments.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/28/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth A Friis"
