 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will theoretically underpin Advanced LIGO's searches for gravitational waves (GWs) from stellar collapse and core-collapse supernovae and will lay the foundations for a GW-neutrino multimessenger astronomy of core-collapse supernovae in preparation for the next galactic supernova. The project team will develop open-source computer software and efficient algorithms to simulate core-collapse supernovae in full 3D, study the associated emission of gravitational waves and neutrinos, and establish the understanding of how these messengers can be profitably used to probe the astrophysics of supernovae and fundamental physics.  The education program consists of a bi-annual summer school at the California Institute of Technology that will bring together astronomy and gravitational-wave physics graduate students to train them in the physics and astrophysics of gravitational-wave sources.\r\n\r\nCore-collapse supernovae are among the most energetic events in the universe. They are triggered by the collapse of supergiant stars and their explosions enrich the interstellar gas with the elements of life (carbon, oxygen, iron).  This research program is motivated by the pressing need to understand how core-collapse supernovae work. It is known that these extreme events are connected to the collapse of massive stars, but it has not yet been clearly established how the initial collapse is reversed and turned into an explosion. An observation of the next galactic core-collapse supernova by Advanced LIGO and by neutrino observatories may shed light on the supernova phenomenon and this research project strives towards creating the theoretical foundation for the interpretation of such signals.  The educational part of this program is motivated by the need, in preparation for Advanced LIGO, of training the first generation of true GW astronomers -- scientists who are trained in the physics and observation of gravitational waves and in the physics and astrophysics of their sources.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAt the end of a massive star's life, when the nuclear reactions in the\nstar's core can no longer counteract gravity, the core collapses,\ntriggering a powerful explosion known as a core-collapse supernova\n(CCSN). CCSNe are a key site for the production of elements via\nnuclear reactions, and also of the distribution of these elements,\nwhich can eventually find their way into gas clouds that form stars\nand planets. The oxygen and sodium atoms in our bodies were once\ninside the core of a massive star and spread through the universe by a\nCCSN.\n\nAlthough CCSNe have been observed for centuries, the details of how\nthe explosion works are only now being figured out.  CCSNe are\nobserved not only via the light they emit, but also via other\nelectromagnetic signals (x-rays, gamma rays, etc.), the detection of\nlow-mass particles called neutrinos, and in the future by\ngravitational waves observed by instruments such as LIGO.\n\nOur work aims at understanding CCSNe and connecting their\nobservational signatures to their underlying fundamental physics and\nastrophysics.  This is done through computer solutions of the\ncomplicated equations that govern CCSNe: equations for gravity\n(including general relativity), hydrodynamics, magnetic fields,\nneutrino emission, and nuclear reactions.  The largest computers are\nonly now becoming powerful enough to do this work.\n\nThis project has made a number of contributions to understanding of\nCCSNe, including:\n\n(1) We have shown that turbulence is a key feature of the supernova\nmechanism; without turbulence the explosion does not occur.\n\n(2) We have shown that it is not sufficient to solve the relevant\nequations for CCSNe under the assumption that the supernova is\nsymmetric about an axis of rotation; the equations must be solved in\nall three dimensions, even though that requires much more computer\npower.\n\n(3) We have developed and released an open-source code SNEC\nthat is now used by others in the community to predict how the brightness\nof a supernova fades over time.\n\n(4) We have shown that a particular instability, known as the magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI) operates during rotating CCSNe, can be responsible for\ndriving the explosion, and results in large magnetic fields.\n\n(5) We have made predictions for gravitational waves in CCSNe using\nparticular beyond-Einstein theories of gravity.  These predictions can\nbe used by future gravitational-wave observations to test whether\nEinstein's equations are indeed the correct theory of gravitation.\n\n(6) We build a public code for handling the equation of state (EOS)\nin objects like CCSNe and neutron stars.  The EOS is a\ntechnical name for how matter behaves when compressed.  We know the EOS\nfor ordinary substances like water or air, but the EOS for the matter in\na neutron star is unknown; a key goal of CCSNe and neutron-star binary\nobservations is to figure out the EOS.\n\n(7) We developed a public code Skynet that computes nuclear reactions\ninside a CCSNe or neutron-star collision.\n\n(8) We showed that binary black hole mergers in stellar-density gas\nlook nothing like black hole mergers in vacuum, disproving theories\nsuggesting that any of LIGO's observed gravitational wave events\noccurred inside a star.\n\n(9) We carried out the first comparison of different ways to compute\nneutrino effects in multidimensional CCSNe.  Neutrino effects are\ncritical for the explosion to occur, but are not quite possible to\ncompute with today's computers unless certain approximations are made.\nThis comparison evaluates how accurate those approximations are.\n\nThis award also supported the Caltech Gravitational Wave Astrophysics\nSchool (CGWAS).  The first of CGWAS was held July 22-26, 2013, and the\nsecond was July 6-10, 2015. The second had 60 participants from 11\nnations. CGWAS (1) provided education on the astrophysics of\ngravitational-wave sources, (2) developed a common knowledge base on\nobservational methods, (3) performed hands-on training in data\nanalysis, and (4) furthered collaboration among young scientists.\n\nThis project helped train a new generation of scientists and others\nwith STEM related careers. The project involved 10 Ph.D. students and\n16 postdoctoral researchers.\n\nWe have also communicated our work to the public via lectures, social\nmedia posts, newspapers, and magazines. Many of our results can be\nseen on our YouTube channel, https://youtube.com/SXSCollaboration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/07/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Fiona A Harrison"
