 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eustigmatophyceae are a little-known group of microalgae in a lineage that includes the more familiar diatoms and kelps.  Recent culture studies have revealed that the Eustigmatophyceae are much more common and diverse than previously thought. DNA sequence analyses from these strains and named Eustigmatophyceae have shown that the existing morphologically-based taxonomy of the class is flawed.  In collaboration with scientists in Prague, Czech Republic, this project will characterize new Eustigmatophyceae strains with the goals of 1) description of new genera and species; and 2) a revision of the higher-level classification of the Eustigmatophyceae.   A multi-faceted approach using analyses of morphology, life history, pigments, and DNA sequence data will be used to achieve these goals.  Criteria for the identification of species, genera, and families will be identified.  \r\n\r\nThe Eustigmatophyceae have significant potential for the biofuels industry, a current National priority.  Moreover, some species have high levels of omega fatty acids and could be used to produce these lipids as nutritional supplements. Understanding the diversity of the Eustigmatophyceae should positively impact the practical use of these algae. The project will also significantly impact undergraduate training at UAM, a minority-serving institution of approximately 3900 students located in economically depressed southeast Arkansas.",

Our work, utilizing DNA sequence data from strains that we isolated from Itasca State Park in Minnesota, clearly showed the flaws of the current taxonomy and resulted in the publication of a new ordinal-level group, the Clade Goniochloridales, with multiple family-level lineages.  These new family-level lineages comprised many new strains that could not be assigned to existing genera.  Thus, they were initially giving the working names Clade IIa, Clade IIb and Clade IIc.  New relationships and additional lineages were also found in the existing order, Eustigmatales.  This taxonomic framework for the Eustigmatophyceae has been well accepted by the Phycological community and has proven very useful for the description of new taxa. Sequences generated in metagenomics studies can also be placed in a much more precise taxonomy than was previously possible, enabling high resolution population studies of the Eustigmatophyceae. We are presently working to describe new species, genera and families from among these lineages so that the taxonomy will be completed according to the requirements of the Botanical Code.\n\nWe have also completed significant work on the best known Eustigmatophyceae genus, Nannochloropsis.  Species of Nannochloropsis are among the primary algal candidates for biofuels and lipid production.  We identified a new species of Nannochloropsis, N. australis, based DNA sequence data and described the new genus, Microchloropsis.  To our knowledge, Microchloropsis is the first microalgal genus partially defined by differences in the plastid genome.  Additional research with students from our Research Program for Minority Students has focused on the freshwater Nannochloropsis strains (most described species of Nannochloropsis are marine).  These students examined our large collection of Nannochloropsis strains from lakes in Minnesota and North Dakota using DNA sequence data from highly variable chloroplast loci.  They revealed a wealth of diversity among the freshwater strains, indicating several new species.  The pattern of diversification of the freshwater Nannochloropsis strains provides evidence for adaptive radiation of this genus upon transition from marine to fresh water, a phenomenon not previously documented for algae. Nannochloropsis and Microchloropsis are under intensive study as potential biofuel organisms and our work contributes to those studies by adding new diversity and a better understanding of the relationships of the organisms.\n\nOther students have worked with us to identify new diversity and begin naming new genera and species in the Goniochloridales lineage of the Eustigmatophyceae.  The majority of organisms in this lineage are unnamed strains that we have isolated.  Describing and naming these organisms is an ongoing process that will probably continue for several years as new culture efforts reveal even more diversity.\n\nOur research on the Eustigmatophyceae has greatly contributed to the major review on the class published in the new edition of Handbook of the Protists that we coauthored with several European collaborators.  This review incorporates our taxonomic framework for the Eustigmatophyceae and our discoveries concerning the diversity of the class.\n\nThis project has also had significant Broader Impacts, as it has a significant undergraduate training component.  Eighteen undergraduate students worked on this project, of which 13 are underrepresented minority students.  These students learned the basics of modern biology research and specialized techniques including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing and high resolution light microscopy. They presented their results at local and state meetings.  Much of their work will ultimately be published in scientific journals.  We also worked with an eighth grade class to discover a new species of the Eustigmatophyceae.  Many of the students had no prior exposure to eukaryotic microalgae.  All of the students who worked on this project now have a much better understanding of scientific research, and several will be going on to graduate school in biology or chemistry.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen Fawley"
