 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate change is rapidly transforming forests over much of the globe in ways that are not anticipated by current science.  Large scale forest diebacks, apparently linked to interactions involving drought, warm winters, and other species, are becoming alarmingly frequent.  Models of biodiversity and climate have not provided guidance on if, where or when such responses will occur.  Instead models tend to provide potential numbers of extinctions, but such forecasts are not linked in any mechanistic way to the processes that could cause them.  Both modeling and field studies rely on aggregate measures of species presence or absence, or their relative abundance at regional scales. However, climate acts on individuals. Aggregating data on individual trees to the level of a whole species hides or may even change predictions of climate effects.  This study aims to link individual scale tree processes to regional species level responses by sampling and analyzing data about individuals across their entire range and corresponding range in climate conditions.  It will use data from existing research sites, plus the platform of sites that form the core of the new National Ecological Observatory Network. These data will be collectively synthesized and used to develop computer models that can help determine when and where predicting climate impacts on biodiversity is a plausible goal. The models will also reveal where surprises are likely to occur and can provide feedback to expectations of individual tree health and vulnerability to environmental changes.  \r\n\r\nThis study will provide the first forecasts of the vulnerability of forest biodiversity to changes in climate that are directly linked to the biological processes that are most sensitive.  The goal is to provide forecasts of the distribution, growth, reproduction and risks of mortality for tree species making up the nation's forests.  These predictions will help scientists, forest managers and policy makers anticipate the combined risks of increasing drought and longer growing seasons.  Methods and results developed during this project will be disseminated through workshops for training resource managers, as well as graduate students and postdoctoral associates at a number of universities.",

It provided predictions of the species that are vulnerable to  climate change. Analyses showed that the limitation on forest capacity  to store carbon is limited more by moisture than  by temperature.  Results showed that strong competition limits the  recruitment of new seedlings into forest communities.  Contrary to  previous thought, density-dependence effects are more negative for  common than rare species, providing one mechanism for allowing  rare species to persist amongst more abundant competitors.  The rate at  which species are becoming vulnerable to climate change (expected loss  per degree C and per year) varies considerably across the US.  Highest  vulnerability to warming is currently in the  South, while the rate of climate change is highest in the North.   Results showed that tree populations are not migrating northward fast  enough to keep pace with climate change.  Each species differed in its  responses to each climate variable (temperature,  drought), which included strong effects of interactions.

Broader impacts include the \"National Assessment  of Drought in Forests and Rangelands\", which highlights the importance  of the joint size-species distribution for understanding climate impacts  on forests.  Also from this study, are the sections in that report  explaining underappreciation of droughts in eastern  forests, because they set in motion protracted morbidity that is not  recognized as death until years later.  Clark co-directed this effort,  which led to presentation to the White House in 2016, with two Special  Features, in Global  Change Biology and Forest Ecology and Management.
