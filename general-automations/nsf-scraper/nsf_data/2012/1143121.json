 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a design concept and demonstrate the feasibility of a continuous process to produce low-cost silicon wafers for solar cells. The approach is to cool a molten bath of silicon from the top to be below its melting point, producing a thin silicon sheet directly from the molten silicon bath. This technique allows the monocrystalline or highly textured silicon sheets to be continuously produced. A liquid or solid layer will be used to support the silicon and ensure uniformity. \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to significantly reduce the cost of silicon wafers for solar cells. Today, the cost of silicon wafers is about 45% of the total cost of a complete solar panel. This process is expected to reduce the cost of silicon wafer by 40-65%, and thus, greatly reduce overall cost per watt of electricity generated from solar cells.",

The system pulls the thin silicon sheet at different and \tprecisely controllable speeds from the silicon melt.\n\n\n\nUsing \tthe extractor system, we were able to pull a mono-crystalline sheet \tof Silicon upto a depth of 300 &mu;m by controlling the thermal \tprofile and the pulling rate.\n\n\n\nWe \tdeveloped a computational fluid dynamics model and a full-scale \twater model to estimate the heat flow from the silicon melt to the \tcooling medium through solid silicon film.

The plant design consists of different zones:  the \tmelt zone, stabilization zone and the extraction zone for the \textraction of thin Silicon sheet.\n\n\n\n \n\nBased on the above milestones achieved in this Phase I project, we also verified that the proposed approach holds the potential to offer the following economic benefits over conventional wafering processes:\n\n \n\n\n\nPurification \tand silicon sheet production are carried out during crystallization. \tThis allows the use of less clean raw materials than classical \tcasting processes. This is an additional cost reduction opportunity. \n\n\n\nThe \tdirection of the production flow is perpendicular to the direction \tof crystallization. High process utilization can be expected. \tProduction cost can be decreased significantly.\n\n\n\nThe \tprocess produces thin sheets of silicon continuously and hence there \tare no kerf losses. This results in a major reduction in silicon \tloss.\n\n\n\nThe \tdesign is simple and hence the capital cost will be relatively less.\n\n\n\n \n\nSeveral papers, conference proceedings and one patent application disclose various aspects of the proposed process.
