 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAGER project, supported by the Energy, Power and Adaptive Systems program in ECCS aims to develop a highly novel, bio-inspired, thin and flat solar concentrator (TFSC). This imaging optic is stationary and thus reduces the need for a tracker in solar energy applications. For example, it can be used in utility-scale solar farms or integrated with house-building and household items to bring solar energy conversion closer to everyday life. Since solar tracking is precluded in such stationary applications, the acceptance angle becomes an important issue. To achieve a wide acceptance angle in a TFSC without sacrificing its collection efficiency, ease of fabrication, or compactness, we plan to borrow useful concepts from nature.",
