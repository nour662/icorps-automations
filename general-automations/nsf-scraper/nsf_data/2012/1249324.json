 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to the University of Massachusetts Boston to manage, in collaboration with the BIO REU Leadership Committee, the BIO REU Travel Scholarship and Just-in-Time review programs. Biology REU programs are dynamic and multi-disciplinary. To ensure that students appreciate the full scope of \"doing science\" it is crucial that students are able to present their work to their scientific peers. To enable students to present their work in poster, oral, or written form this program will offer electronic submission and rapid review of research products. BIO REU student research materials will be reviewed by graduate research students from across the US providing not only content review but also an expanded network of near-peer mentors, further strengthening the impact of the BIO REU experience. In addition the program provides travel scholarships for students to attend and present their research at scientific meetings. These meetings are the ideal venue to ensure that students fulfill the research experience which culminates in peer-review of their work. The goal of both programs is to support undergraduate researchers to publish and/or present their research to the scientific community ensuring that research results are disseminated broadly. Students will apply for funds and/or submit their research materials for review on-line at http://www.bioreu.org. Just-in-Time review will utilize cutting-edge real-time editing and response tools ensuring that students receive feedback quickly. Applications for travel will be reviewed by a selection sub-committee of the BIO REU Leadership Council and will include the abstract submitted for presentation, letters of recommendation from REU mentors and site directors as well as an essay from the student regarding the anticipated professional development outcomes of attendance and presentation. Travel awards will be based on student application materials with priority given for one student award per REU site. Students will, in addition to presenting their research, have the opportunity to share their presentation/poster with the broader REU community through the BIO REU website. For additional information visit http://www.bioreu.org or contact Dr. Robyn Hannigan (Robyn.Hannigan@umb.edu).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Biological Sciences Research Experiences for Undergraduates Leadership Council initiated and supported, through this award, travel scholarships for BIO-REU students to present their research at scientific meetings following the completion of their summer REU experience.  In addition the project provided students with additional mentorship and review of research products including evaluation and editing of final REU papers, presentations, and posters.  The program supported the travel and attendance of 42 undergraduate students fr across the US who shared the results of their research with scholars in their disciplines.  The results of their research and their meeting abstracts were evaluated by graduate student metors and additional assistance was provided to these students in advance of their participation in the meeting.  Through this experience students were deeply engaged in the process of peer-review and dissemination of research results.  Through this expereince they gained professional development opprotunities including networing and scientific presentation skills.  A new model of on-line collaboration was developed that supports rapid review of studet materials and real-time interactions between students and gradaute mentors who are assigned to review and mentor students as they compete their final research projects.  The results of this project demonstrated the added learning gains provided by rapid review and consistent feedback on research in advance of presenting their results for the first time in their careers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/09/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robyn E Hannigan"
