 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Maryland doctoral candidate Melissa Stevens, supervised by Dr. Erve Chambers, will conduct research on resident perspectives on cultural tourism by looking at processes of identity formation and negotiated ethnicities in resident-tourist interactions. Until recently, social science research on the impacts of interactions between residents and tourists has assumed a unidirectional power dynamic that resulted from the motivations of tourists and the impacts on residents. But more recent research suggests that residents are not passive in these interactions. This research will explore this possibility through research at a cultural tourism enterprise in the village of Longido, a primarily Maasai community in the heart of northern Tanzania's safari tourism circuit. \r\n\r\nThe researcher will employ a mix of social science research methods, including observations of resident-tourist interactions, surveys of tourists, and interviews with residents. The data will be analyzed to determine the nature and direction of influence, with a particular focus on Maasai representation of Maasai identity in a cultural tourism setting, Maasai motivations, and its effects on the touristic relationship.\r\n\r\nFindings from this research will contribute to theorizing ethnicity as a malleable rather than inherent human characteristic. Tourism is of growing significance developing economies. Understanding tourism processes and relationships is thus critically important. Community-based cultural tourism initiatives, such as the Longido enterprise, have the potential for reducing poverty and encouraging local-level conservation activities but this potential depends on host community autonomy. By exploring the bi-directional nature of the resident-tourist power dynamic, this research seeks to contribute to a better understanding of how residents of tourist destinations shape as well as are shaped by the global phenomenon of tourism. Supporting this research also supports the education of a graduate student.",
