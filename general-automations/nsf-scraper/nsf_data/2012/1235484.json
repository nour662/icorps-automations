 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to develop models that increase our understanding of complex health care delivery systems from the perspective of the patient flowing through the system.  The project will i) create a care delivery reference model, that will explain the interactions and inter-dependencies of the many functions, process flows, behaviors, constraints, and attributes of current U.S. health care delivery systems;  and ii) using the reference model as a guide, construct a suite of operational systems engineering models to examine the complex interactions between patients, sources of primary and secondary care, facilities, insurance providers, laboratories, pharmacies, and other ancillary services. The approach will include simulation, Markov chain models, stochastic optimization, and simulation optimization. These models will help compare the performance of design alternatives and their impact on patient-centered care in modern health care delivery systems.   \r\n\r\nThe modeling effort will relate patient needs with resources and clinical outcomes to guide design of primary care based health care delivery systems. The models developed will be used to investigate: the Patient Centered Medical Home, which will examine how to reorganize the clinic workforce to match patients with care provider teams in an optimal manner; Accountable Care Organizations, which will investigate when to contract outside specialists to optimize the flow of patients with regards to clinical effectiveness and financial factors; and Redesign of Outpatient Health Care Facilities, which will analyze the performance of new patient-centered arrangements where services are brought to the patient's physical location. The impact of virtual interaction between patients and providers including video, email, and phone communication will also be evaluated.  This research will make a broad impact on national health care, by creating a consistent and comprehensive basis for evaluating alternative designs of patient-centered health care delivery systems.",

To date, modeling efforts to aid in designing health care systems have examined individual services and not considered the patient perspective integrated into the organization as a whole. We constructed a suite of operational systems engineering models (using Markov chain, simulation, and optimization models) to assist with understanding the myriad functions, process flows, behaviors, constraints, attributes, and inter-dependencies of which health care delivery systems are composed.</p>\n<p>Our modeling efforts contributed to <strong><em>intellectual merit</em></strong> by linking patient needs with resources and clinical effectiveness. Our models facilitated answering design questions impacting an entire health care delivery system. We contributed to the three themes of knowledge innovation, knowledge transfer, and meta-knowledge integration, through our model building and analysis of data from the Group Health Research Institute (GHRI).</p>\n<p>Our research made a <strong><em>broad impact</em></strong> on national health care, by creating a consistent and comprehensive basis for evaluating alternative designs of a patient-centered health care delivery system.&nbsp; We have also integrated models and methods developed during this research into classes and seminars offered in the University of Washington School of Public Health as well as Industrial and Systems Engineering, thus extending the impact of the research beyond engineering students to include newly trained students and professionals in Public Health.</p>\n<p>One question facing the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) is the value of introducing virtual or asynchronous visits through either telephone encounters or secured messaging as a means to increase access and reduce overall health care costs. To address this question, we developed a Markov chain model using GHRI data before and after virtual encounters were&nbsp;implemented, to analyze the impact virtual encounters have on face-to-face visits, see Figure 1.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our research team used simulation and optimization to assist with the design of a campaign at Seattle Children&rsquo;s Hospital of concurrent influenza immunization and tuberculosis (TB) screening in a compressed time frame. Combining immunization and annual TB screening in a single campaign reduces the number of clinic visits by health care workers. Compressing the time frame allows health care workers to be immunized as soon as vaccines are available, before the start of the flu season. However, an effective and efficient campaign requires detailed planning by Occupational Health Services (OHS) to provide the necessary immunization, blood draw and registration resources as well as coordination with the Laboratory Medicine Department (LMD) to assure the resources are available to provide timely tuberculosis screening results. There were two goals for the campaign: 1) return the results of the TB screening to the health care workers within 14 days; and 2) provide a short waiting time for patients and health care workers at OHS.</p>\n<p>Initially, we created a simulation with historical data to aid in design decisions (OHS staffing and LMD scheduling), however, the number of actual arrivals to the system were nearly double the number anticipated. Our approach then switched to an operational phase to update important parameters based on observed values, and refine the campaign (add staff, modify lab schedule).&nbsp; This two-phase approach, see Figure 2, was very effective, and the result of the first year provided information so the campaign in the second year was compressed from 90 days to 45 days while maintaining performance goals of short waiting times and fast TB screening results.</p>\n<p>Another important question facing the PCMH is how to reorganize the health care work force to create cohesive physician led teams that will create greater continuity of care, improved access, and a more responsive health care system. This is challenging, in part, due to the high levels of uncertainty in demand for services, and the multiple objectives that need to be considered; from the patient viewpoint (ready access to care, short transportation time, continuity of care provider), from the physician viewpoint (reduce stress, able to deliver quality care), and from the system viewpoint (reduce cost). &nbsp;Figure 3 illustrates a geographic model for locating specialist services within a network of clinics that balances the pros and cons of centralized versus local clinics providing different types of specialist care regionally.</p>\n<p>We also addressed optimal resource allocation, specifically, allocation of portable ultrasound machines to supplement/replace MRI capacity for shoulder diagnosis. While MRI is clearly more expensive, it is currently more accurate than portable ultrasound machines in diagnosing the need for shoulder surgery.&nbsp; Using a simulation-optimization algorithm designed for multiple objectives, we created an efficient frontier of solutions to quantify the tradeoffs between cost and patient health utility loss, see Figure 4.</p>\n<p>All of our models are patient-centered in that the objective functions always consider individual and/or population health metrics.
