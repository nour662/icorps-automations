 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two principal projects will be undertaken. They both engage modern photon-atom theory, and are designed to increase understanding of advanced methods of optical communication. In one case the principal issue is using light to influence light. A prime application would be to stop a light pulse by coherent absorption in a specific vapor, and later using a second pulse to retrieve it for use. In the other case, the goal is to show how to engage the quantum principle of entanglement in a purely non-quantum context, where light fields are projected to be feasible carriers of classical entanglement.\r\n\r\nThe consequences and benefits of the research to be done are numerous, and include advances in speed and reliability of communication systems, potentially incorporating novel aspects of communication security. The skills acquired by the PhD students who will work on the two projects are expected to be valuable in both industrial and governmental development work following their graduation.",
