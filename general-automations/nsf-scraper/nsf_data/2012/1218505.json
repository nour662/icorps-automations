 "awd_abstract_narration": "The success of cloud computing as a business model has led to several commercial cloud services for storage, data mining and searching, and multimedia content delivery. As cloud services penetrate emerging markets   -- notably the smart-phone market  --  conventional utility services such as television are becoming ?cloudized.?   \r\n\r\nAs the economy becomes more dependent on the efficient operation of cloud data centers (DCs), there?s an increasingly urgent need to design ?green? and energy-adaptive management software that optimizes the operation of a geographically distributed set of data centers under varying workload and energy conditions.\r\n\r\nCyber-physical, proactive and predictive decision making is essential for a DC operating system that efficiently predicts, e.g., the workload and the power consumption when running multiple jobs on the same server and makes decisions, e.g., for redistributing the servicing virtual machines  among varying number of available DCs, electricity cost, percentage of renewable energy supply and capacity of energy storage. \r\n\r\nThis project is addressing the scientific and engineering challenges involved in decision making of such DC management arising from an array of complicating factors -- e.g., server heterogeneity, cyber-physical interactions between DCs and their environment, varying  workload and  electricity pricing -- and trade-offs  -- e.g., energy-delay, time-accuracy, and cooling-computing . The project is developing a Green cyber-physical Data Center Simulator, GDCSim, for studying the tradeoffs in practical scenarios with several complicating factors.  \r\n\r\nProject aims to enable a more sustainable cloud computing and to train engineers for a greener economy.  The project findings are available through ASU-IMPACT lab?s website (http://impact.asu.edu/).",

The research was aimed at addressing various tradeoffs in managing dynamic workload and power in data centers. The aim was to consider various aspects of the data center including workload (such as internet and high-performance computing) , operational cost in terms of energy, cooling efficiency, renewable energy harvesting, and energy storage. The trade-offs that were considered in the course of the research included latency-energy tradeoff, where interference effect of co-hosted applications were included in the formulation, accuracy-depth trade-off of workload prediction of internet data centers, cooling-computing energy trade-off of workload consolidation, and capacity-leakage trade-off of energy storage devices. The primary challenge at the individual data center level was to characterize the cyber-physical interactions of among equipment within each data center such as equipment thermal interferences and of the data center with its environment such as data center carbon footprint. The outcomes of the interactions at the individual data center level in terms of energy cost, latency, harvested energy, and carbon footprint, affected the operation of the geo-distributed data center network.
