They will also test whether incorporating helium gradients can improve the thermal evolution models of Saturn and Jupiter. \r\n\r\nThis project has broader impacts in that it will train students in interdisciplinary scientific research, and produce results that are applicable in fields outside of astronomy, including applied mathematics and global oceanic mixing.",
