The research efforts will be anchored by the University of California-Davis (UCD) as the lead institution, partnered with the University of Nevada Reno (UNR). \r\n\r\nDespite its potential, the development of geothermal energy has been slow relative to other renewable energy technologies. The critical challenge in expanding geothermal energy applications has been identified as the inability to target the sub-surface resource(s). Over the past decade, however, high performance computing, three-dimensional visualization, and geo-physical and geo-chemical analyses have been identified as possible solutions to address this challenge. These and other techniques are rapidly maturing and could provide powerful tools in advancing research in the broad topics of (1) geothermal resource exploration, (2) the production and management of known geothermal reservoirs, and (3) the frontiers of geothermal energy research. Faculty and student researchers at UCD and UNR, in partnership with industry, have the ability to advance the utilization of geothermal resources through this proposed I/UCRC in geothermal energy resources. \r\n\r\nAn I/UCRC in geothermal energy resources would promote development of new exploration and reservoir management techniques to increase the certainty in drilling productive boreholes, thus reducing the financial risk of exploration. An I/UCRC in geothermal energy resources would provide an energetic venue within which interaction could be fostered amongst industry, academic researchers, graduate students and undergraduate students. The goal of the proposed Center would be to focus research efforts on topics with a high potential for successfully addressing industry-identified major challenges, as well as to provide educational opportunities for students to develop interest and expertise in geothermal studies. The proposed Center would also hope to engage the international geothermal community, e.g., through existing research collaborations in Iceland and elsewhere.",
