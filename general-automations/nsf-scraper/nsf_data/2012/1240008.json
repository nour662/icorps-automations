 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our understanding of why people come together to create social networks is evolving as social media grow in complexity and popularity. Of particular interest is understanding how social networks emerge and are enacted across geography, culture and over time ? especially when they are generated by a polarizing event such as global climate change. \r\n\r\nThis project, 3dWomen, will study the emergence and enactment of a network among women that has coalesced around the World Congress on Sustainable Development (CSD) that meets every ten years (1992, 2002, and will convene again in June 2012).  The 3dWomen project takes advantage of a unique opportunity for three dimensional research on the emergence of this network across time (three decades), space (global networks) and culture.  This in-depth and multidimensional research is only possible because, in response to the great sense of urgency to address the global climate crisis, the women?s caucus which will reconvene in 2012 will bring together the women from the CSD events in 1992, 2002 and 2012.\r\n\r\nOur analysis - based on interviews, archival data and social network analysis - will allow us to elucidate how different networking mechanisms at and between the CSD events, contribute to women persisting to engage in networks on specialized fields such as sustainability, science and climate change.",

These three dimensions included: (1) the semantic (or knowledge) dimension of the network; (2) the social (or collaborative) dimension; and (3) and the relationship between the semantic and social dimensions.  Each part of this analysis yielded salient insights, which we describe below.\n\n \n\nThe semantic dimension of the issue network speaks to how network members order their understanding of the key issues that they work to advance: gender and sustainability. As a network of concept relationships, semantic structure is captured in terms of influential words and word pairs used to describe the unique contributions women make to the institutional conversation about sustainable development. \n\n \n\nWe found that \"high influence\" words tended to represent the societal contexts in which women play important roles that contribute to or are perceived to be related to environmental sustainability, for example \"agriculture\", \"community\", and \"health.\"  Second, other influential words like \"caring\" and \"family\" and \"community\" suggest certain stereotypes about women and what they contribute to society (i.e., being maternal, family oriented, natural community builders).  But they also occurred in the same space as words like \"decision maker\", \"leadership\", and  \"management\", which imply qualities of professionalism.  So there seemed to be two different themes presented here.  The first builds on traditional notions of women\u00c6s roles and a very practical understanding of how women can be mobilized in efforts to facilitate sustainable development on the ground. While the second theme seems to take the perspective of women as professional actors in this space, advocating and making policy decisions.\n\n \n\nThe second dimension of the issue network that we examined was the social dimension, which was measured in terms collaboration between network members.

Here we sought to understand how having similar perspectives on the contributions women make to the conversation about sustainable development (i.e., semantic similarity) influences collaborative choices.
