The project is building on education reform at the undergraduate and doctoral levels and targets reform at the Masters level. By using a research-based Masters degree, scholars will be supported to bridge the period from undergraduate studies into the doctoral program. The program is emphasizing the recruitment of underrepresented populations and will award 10 scholarships every year. The scholarship recipients will also receive a full tuition waiver from Columbia Engineering and a stipend from their faculty research advisor. Support structures for the students include mentoring, cohort building and leadership development. The work is focusing on the recruitment and retention of a diverse group of graduate students and facilitates their integration into research centers to promote connections between students, teaching experiences, leadership and other research-based training.",
