 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve the efficiency and performance of wireless systems that use Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) configurations. MIMO systems use multiple antennas to multiply the amount of data transmitted over a given channel using the same spectral footprint as non-MIMO systems. However, there is a large capability gap in detection techniques for MIMO systems between the state of the art in research and commercial implementations. While much research has been focused on reducing complexity for optimal or near-optimal schemes, it is still common practice in industry to use simple techniques (such as linear equalization) that are generally significantly less efficient. This situation sits in stark contrast to the reality that users are demanding increasingly higher data rates while service providers are struggling to work within the limited radio spectrum they have available. While theoretical methods exist to increase data rates without increasing bandwidth, commercialization of these techniques will require addressing both significant theoretical challenges and severe practical implementation hurdles. This team plans to leverage promising preliminary results from research on wireless communication theory and hardware design towards the development and commercialization of significantly more efficient commercial-grade detectors for various MIMO systems. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will directly result in the commercialization of advanced equalization techniques for MIMO systems. As these advances are compatible with existing systems, the significant gains in range, power, and spectral efficiency can be realized without changes to existing infrastructure. This multi-disciplinary project will provide a competent framework to understand interrelationship among the hardware and software implementations. Such a framework can be used to focus future theoretical communications research more effectively on implementable systems that can benefit consumer, government, and industrial sectors. This project will also establish a conduit for commercialization of further advances in communications and enhance the research partnership between the investigators and the researchers in the wireless communication industry facilitating application of scientific discoveries to the application domains.",
