 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is expanding an existing partnership between Baton Rouge Community College Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Division (BRCC-STEM) and Louisiana State University College of Engineering (LSU-CoE) to increase STEM students' completion of two year Associates of Science (AS) and Applied Science (AAS) Degrees at BRCC and four year Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees at LSU (emphasizing Engineering/Construction Management - E/CM). One project outcome is to increase the number of BRCC AS/AAS E/CM graduates to 25 annually who have strong academic foundations for further E/CM study at LSU.  For LSU, the goal is to improve the overall 2nd-3rd year retention and ultimately the cumulative 6th year graduation rate in engineering by 2-3% annually to the current university average for all entering freshmen (59%). Grounded in the \"sense of community\" lessons learned from an earlier STEP project, the results of small group discussions with BRCC students and research-based educational practices, these goals are being met through the following actions:  1) designing and implementing a pre-engineering learning community at BRCC; 2) integrating supplemental instruction/academic support such as Peer Lead Team Learning (PLTL) in core STEM/Engineering courses at both institutions; 3) expanding faculty development opportunities and supporting faculty-student interaction/collaboration across institutions that improves student learning; 4) providing the environment and training necessary to develop mentoring relationships among students (particularly transfer students), faculty and practicing professional/industry partners; and 5) implementing  mechanisms for effective monitoring and continuous improvement. This project is serving as a model for STEM Student Success.",

Both institutions adopted supplemental academic support models to foster success in foundational math/science and 2<sup>nd</sup>year &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; engineering courses (statics, circuits and thermodynamics). Concurrent and collaborative professional development in proven effective learning pedagogies fostered early connection between LSU/BRCC STEM faculty in foundation courses. Lastly, expansion of effective peer-to-peer/prot&eacute;g&eacute; activities were adopted to improve students&rsquo; abilities to confront the challenges of the sophomore year as well as promote the successful transition of community college (BRCC) students to a larger research intensive university (LSU).</p>\n<p>A Transfer Counselor (part time), sharing time between the community college and four-year university (BRCC and LSU), was an effective resource preparing students and easing their transition between programs. With the number of students reached annually being limited, the position was extended only briefly beyond the close of the grant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"default\">Supplemental Instruction (SI) initiated early for gateway engineering courses has expanded substantially through this project with SI support provided for 17 courses in 2018 across 7 out of 8 departments this past Fall 2018 semester. Data collected indicates that regular attendees at SI (1/3 or more of total sessions) were 23% more likely to pass a class. Students in ethnic minority groups make the largest gains in course performance, essentially closing the gap between all students. The passing rate for regular SI attendees over non-attendees by ethnicity is: African Americans&ndash;39.5%, Hispanic&ndash;23.5%, Asian&ndash;31.5% and Caucasian&ndash;21.4%. Additionally, students who regularly attend SI sessions are 15% more likely to persist in engineering by year 4 and 10% more likely to persist by year 5. LSU&rsquo;s College of Engineering has committed to funding SI in the years ahead and to fundraising for long term sustainability.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Introduced with the STEP grants to support freshmen retention activities, peer mentoring has thrived and now includes significant&nbsp;leadership development. In 2012, student leaders&nbsp;established an official LSU student organization, the Society of Peer Mentors (SPM), and in 2019 are looking to expand its presence both regionally and nationally.&nbsp;The peer mentoring program provides an exceptionally strong learning community within the mentors. Most students serve as peer mentors for more than one year, and 65-75% of them returning to attain active status in the Society of Peer Mentors each year. Those who show extra initiative become leaders who help to recruit, train, and develop new mentors. This hierarchical system creates opportunities for real mentoring and exercising leadership development within the organization. Encouraged to formally propose and develop activities of their choosing (seed funds and administrative support provided), industrious peer mentor leaders have delivered a Chemical Engineering boot camp, the first 24 hour hack-a-thon in Louisiana (Geaux Hack), a weekend training workshop for middle/high school teachers to improve their robotics teams, a 3 Day Robot build project (successfully completed for each of the last 3 years), and the first college-level engineering design competition held in Louisiana (the Louisiana Collegiate Design Competition (LCDC)). Student leaders also recently filed and received 501(c)3 status for SPM, which will allow the organization to expand to other universities. Due to these student-led events and the abundance of K-12 outreach activities, the Society of Peer Mentors won the Commitment to Community Award from LSU&rsquo;s Campus Life office in March 2019. Peer mentors are representative of the college with students in every major and an average cumulative GPA; in other words, peer mentors aren&rsquo;t just the top students in their class. However, students who serve as peer mentors have a 90% 6-year graduation rate in engineering, which is over 30% higher than for the college as a whole.</p>\n<p>Lessons learned include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Importance of creating a student-centric culture by listening to and expecting student feedback to develop ownership in programs and to adjust to changes in student needs</li>\n<li>Keeping detailed records and program statistics in order to justify institutionalization by the college and university</li>\n<li>Hiring and maintaining a continuity of dedicated personnel to improve effectiveness of programs across institutions</li>\n</ul><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/09/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Adrienne&nbsp;Steele</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1161311/1161311_10207901_1545248728846_Graduatingmentors2016--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1161311/1161311_10207901_1545248728846_Graduatingmentors2016--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Graduating Mentors\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1161311/1161311_10207901_1545248728846_Graduatingmentors2016--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Graduating Mentors\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graduating peer mentors in 2016;
