Because of its close connection with\r\nmaterial failure initiation, the phenomenon of cavitation has\r\nreceived much attention from the materials and mechanics\r\ncommunities.  Cavitation has also been a subject of interest in\r\nthe mathematical community because its modeling has prompted the\r\ndevelopment of techniques to deal with a broad class of\r\nnon-convex variational problems.  While in recent years\r\nconsiderable progress has been made via energy minimization\r\nmethods to establish existence results, fundamental problems\r\nregarding the quantitative prediction of the occurrence of\r\ncavitation in real material systems remain largely unresolved. \r\nIn this project, the principal investigator develops a novel\r\nframework to study cavitation that: (i) is applicable to large\r\nclasses of nonlinear elastic solids of practical interest, (ii)\r\nallows for 3D general loading conditions with arbitrary\r\ntriaxiality, (iii) incorporates direct information on the initial\r\nshape, spatial distribution, and mechanical properties of the\r\nunderlying defects at which cavitation can initiate, and (iv) is,\r\nat the same time, computationally tractable.  This is\r\naccomplished by means of an innovative iterated homogenization\r\nmethod that allows for the construction of exact solutions for\r\nthe mechanical response of nonlinear elastic materials containing\r\nrandom distributions of initially infinitesimal cavities (or\r\ndefects).  These include solutions for the change in size of the\r\nunderlying cavities as a function of the applied loading\r\nconditions, from which the onset of cavitation can be determined. \r\nIn spite of its generality, the analysis of the proposed\r\nformulation reduces to the study of tractable Hamilton-Jacobi\r\nequations in which the initial size of the cavities plays the\r\nrole of time and the applied load plays the role of space. \r\n\r\n     This project makes available a fresh methodology radically\r\ndifferent from existing approaches to investigate the influence\r\nof defects in solids.  This is a core topic in mechanics, of\r\ngreat importance for understanding and predicting the failure of\r\nreal-world materials.  More generally, the project aims to\r\ndevelop analytical techniques that link the macroscopic\r\nproperties of soft heterogeneous materials directly to their\r\nmicroscopic properties and underlying microstructures, a central\r\nissue in many fields of modern science.  Beyond putting forward\r\nfundamental understanding of how microscopic behavior influences\r\nmacroscopic behavior, these techniques provide engineers and\r\nscientists with mathematical tools to characterize and predict\r\nthe mechanical response and failure of a broad spectrum of soft\r\ncomposite materials, including elastomeric composites (e.g.,\r\nfilled elastomers) and biological tissues (e.g., arterial walls).",
