Day 1 and the pre-workshop preparation will focus on working out proposed strategies and tactics of the plan. Day 2 will be devoted to writing and vetting the specific details.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the activity is to advance combustion science through creation of technical and organizational tools for data archiving, curation, and collaboration. Near-term broader impacts are expected to be technological and educational, creating databases and computational tools for individual, scientific-community, and industrial development and evaluation of a wide range of combustion data. This operational model of software, databases, and support staff should be extensible to other data-generating research communities, transforming the progress of science by allowing improved access and interpretation of data. It should be a model for community development of data-management plans, as well.",
