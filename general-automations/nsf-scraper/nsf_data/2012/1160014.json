 "awd_abstract_narration": "1160014-Biegler\r\n\r\nFor over three decades, Real-Time Optimization (RTO) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) have emerged\r\nas essential technologies for optimal process operation in the chemical and refining industry. More recently,\r\nMPC has been extended to Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) in order to realize high-performance\r\ncontrol of highly nonlinear processes. Moreover, for many applications there is a need for RTO to evolve\r\nfrom steady-state optimization models to dynamic models, especially for systems, such as batch and cyclic\r\nprocesses, that are never in steady state. Both NMPC and dynamic real-time optimization (D-RTO) allow\r\nthe incorporation of first principle process models, which lead to on-line optimization strategies consistent\r\nwith higher-level tasks, including scheduling and planning. However, more detailed dynamic optimization models that reflect complex reaction and separation phenomena and multi-stage dynamic operation still need to be addressed ? and solved as time-critical, on-line applications. Here, a major concern is that computational times needed to solve these large-scale optimizations lead to feedback delays in implementation that can degrade performance and possibly destabilize the process. This proposal addresses these issues and furthers the realization of fast on-line dynamic optimization with first principle models. Our previous work led to a class of sensitivity-based algorithms that separate dynamic optimization into background calculations, where most of the computation is performed, and online calculations, where a perturbed problem is solved very quickly. On-line computations are thus reduced by several orders of magnitude and become very fast, even for large, complex nonlinear models. These formulations were developed both for NMPC as well as state and parameter moving horizon estimation (MHE).\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed activity extends the development and analysis of sensitivity-based\r\non-line optimization with first principle dynamic models, particularly advanced-step NMPC and MHE. This\r\ntransformative proposed work leads to nonlinear model predictive control and on-line dynamic optimization\r\nfor large-scale chemical processes without the limitations of computational feedback delay. Advances will be\r\ndeveloped in the solution of background NLPs over multiple sampling times. In addition, we propose to\r\nextend advanced-step NMPC and MHE to hybrid systems, where discrete decisions (switches) are allowed\r\nat any point in time, and the algorithm suffers no loss in computational efficiency. Moreover, we will\r\nincorporate reduced order nonlinear dynamic models, develop specialized NMPC and MHE approaches for\r\nthese problems and extend them to dynamic real-time optimization. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nBroader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include the development and application of this approach to a number of challenging power generation processes. Characterized by load changes and dynamics with strong nonlinearities, performance of these multi-stage systems can be greatly improved through efficient NMPC and MHE strategies. These concepts will also be integrated within a comprehensive real-time optimization framework that combines open source optimization and sensitivity codes with a state of the art modeling environment. Finally, graduate training is emphasized as a key component of this proposal. Included in the educational plan are industrial interactions with GE Global Research and the development of courses and materials related to Dynamic Real-Time Optimization.",
