The Magnetism\r\nSummer School is the IEEE Magnetics Society?s main outreach effort to promote\r\neducation in the field of magnetism and attract more young scientists to choose a research\r\ncareer in magnetism and related areas. The one-week Magnetism Summer School is\r\ndesigned for graduate students studying magnetism, will consist of lectures by\r\ninternational experts and will include poster presentations by participating graduate\r\nstudents. The program will cover fundamentals and advanced topics in magnetism. The\r\nsummer school is a unique opportunity for young scientists to meet leaders in their field\r\nin a relaxed and collegial atmosphere and to begin establishing a network of colleagues in\r\nthe international research community. The funds requested from NSF will provide\r\nadditional opportunities for U.S. graduate students to attend the Summer School.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe Summer School provides a forum for exchange of information in the field of\r\nmagnetics research. In addition to formal lectures, each participating student is required\r\nto present a poster about their current research. These topics are discussed amongst the\r\nstudents and lecturers during poster sessions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe broader impact of the Summer School lies in the education of young\r\nscientists and researchers in a fast-moving and economically important field. Participants\r\nwill learn both fundamental as well as advanced topics through lectures delivered by\r\ninternationally-renowned experts. In addition, there is a degree of cultural education,\r\nteaching young scientists to interact with and respect their colleagues from other\r\ncountries. The organizers of the Summer School particularly encourage women and\r\nunderrepresented minorities to apply. The program committee also strives for diversity in \r\nthe lecturers selected for the summer school to provide role models for female and minority students.",

In order for the U.S. research institutions to remain competitive and maintain their leadership role it is important for U.S. students to have incomparable educational opportunities and to begin early on to exchange ideas with their counterparts in other countries. This project allowed 10 US graduate students to attend the 2012 IEEE Magnetics Society Summer School in Chennai, India.\nAs a major outreach effort, the IEEE Magnetics Society annually organizes a Summer School for graduate students to promote education in the field of magnetism and attract more young scientists to choose a research career in magnetism and related areas such as permanent magnets for energy efficiency, magnetic nanoparticles for biomedical applications and spintronics for low-power electronics. Each year, the Summer School is held on a different country, with previous schools held in the US and Germany in 2010 and 2011 respectively. Being an international organization, the Magnetics Society supports students from all over the world to attend the Summer School. In addition to the 11 students from US institutions sponsored by the Magnetics Society, funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF) provided additional opportunities for 10 US students, including 3 female students, to attend the School. \nThe organizers of the Summer School particularly encouraged women and underrepresented minorities to apply. With the additional support from NSF the IEEE Magnetics Summer School was able to admit a record student body of 111 pupils hailing from 19 different countries spanning five continents. 23% of the students were female. The students, who were selected from the applications, received full room and board during the school and were reimbursed for most of their travel expenses to Chennai. \n\nDuring this one week summer school, graduate students working in magnetism and related areas had the opportunity to learn from world experts about fundamental and advanced topics in magnetism. The technical program consisted of lectures by the most distinguished educators of the Society. Each student presented a poster on their particular research topic. The poster session provided an outstanding, low-pressure forum for the students to discuss their work with each other and the lecturers. There were additional opportunities for discussion and networking during regular coffee and lunch breaks as well as on a very memorable bus excursion to the tourist sites around Chennai. Bringing together students from all geographical regions promotes a vibrant research society and furthers collaborations of future scientists working in this important field.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Albrecht Jander"
