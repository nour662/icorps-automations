Threshold concepts are concepts that, when mastered, represent a transformed and integrative understanding of a discipline, without which the learner cannot progress. The project goals follow a cycle that uses assessment data and community input in a feedback loop to improve student learning. Materials will be disseminated through a project web site and at regional and national conferences.",
