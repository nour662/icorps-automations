 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kennebec Valley Community College (KVCC) is partnering with local employers, secondary schools, Career and Technical Centers, and the University of Maine to develop and implement a two-year, problem-based learning Energy Services and Technology (EST) Associates Degree program to meet Maine's growing need for energy technicians who can install, maintain, and troubleshoot high-efficiency heating, ventilating, and cooling systems in buildings. The program is giving technicians a working knowledge of building HVAC system concepts and energy efficient design principles. Graduates will be eligible for State of Maine licensing in plumbing, as well as oil burning, solid fuel, propane and natural gas, and refrigeration technologies. With additional coursework, graduates will have the licenses and educational background necessary for further career advancement in renewable and sustainable energy systems, and to pursue a bachelor's degree in engineering technology.\r\n\r\nTo achieve its goals, the EST project is (1) implementing a new energy services and technology curriculum that employs problem-based learning, (2) integrating EST's real-world problems in basic mathematics and science classes, (3) establishing a state-of-the-art EST learning laboratory, (4) establishing an energy technician pipeline from area secondary schools to KVCC and to the University of Maine, and (5) providing professional development for EST college faculty and high school teachers. An evaluation plan is collecting quantitative and qualitative data to measure the project's progress towards achieving its goals and objectives, including success in attaining outcomes pertaining to student enrollment, retention, performance, job placements and other student outcomes.",
