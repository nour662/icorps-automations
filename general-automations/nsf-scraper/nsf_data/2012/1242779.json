The conference will host approximately 60 oral presentations and 100 posters focusing on topics such as sub-atomic imaging resolution in ultra-high vacuum and milli-Kelvin temperatures, nanoscale tribology, chemical force microscopy and multi-scale modeling techniques that combine atomistic simulation with classical mechanics.\r\n\r\nHosting the conference in the U.S. in 2013 will enable a large number of domestic investigators to attend and interact with the most prominent researchers in the field of NC-AFM, most of whom reside in Europe and Japan.  Exposure of young investigators to presentations on the latest NC-AFM techniques and their application to scientific and engineering problems will help educate the next generation of scientists and raise the level of interest in the U.S., such that the country can emerge as a competitor in this important area of nanoscale science and technology.",
