Attending conferences such as INFOCOM is of paramount importance for the development of graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of others performing leading-edge research in the field.\r\nBroader Impact: This proposal provides travel support for approximately fifteen graduate students in the United States to attend this premiere conference. The travel awards will target graduate students, in particular, women and under-represented minority students, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds.",
