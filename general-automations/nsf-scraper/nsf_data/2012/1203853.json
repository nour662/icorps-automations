 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lewis and Clark Community College (L&C) is developing a STEM-based outreach program using hands-on activities for the design and construction of trebuchets. Project activities include constructing STEM-based learning objectives for the trebuchet competition, expanding an existing trebuchet contest to a broader and diverse number of high schools, building collaborative relationships with schools of engineering at regional universities, arranging strategies for tracking the enrollment histories of engineering students, and building partnerships with regional industries to support STEM-based engineering and engineering technology programs. L&C is expanding the level of participation of high schools to at least 25 schools (and 80 teams). Collaborating partners are the Schools of Engineering at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) and Missouri University of Science & Technology (MST). Industrial partners include Covidien Pharmaceutical and Boeing (both of St. Louis). A freshman-level course to introduce students to engineering is also being developed. The project consults with leaders of a related project at Sierra College (CA) and their NSF/ATE Center for Applied Competitive Technologies.",

With science and technology driving much, if not most, of the economic growth throughout the world, it was imperative that the U.S. address this problem to remain globally competitive. A number of programs have been created to engage students at every level and expose them to the possibilities that lay before them in STEM related occupations. To this end, Lewis and Clark Community College (LCCC) developed a trebuchet contest designed to give high school students an engineering experience similar to what they might encounter working as an engineer.

The number of teams increased 57% from 28 to a high of 44, and the number of competitors increased 58% from 120 to a high of 190. Participation by females increased from 22% to 28% and participation by minorities increased from 5% to roughly 9%. In terms of sparking interest in STEM related fields, it is difficult to quantify results.

College representatives provided information on degree programs in engineering and other STEM related majors, while industry representatives showcased current projects and state-of-the-art technology.
