 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ionizing radiation from massive stars is a major component of the energy budget of individual galaxies and of the cosmos itself. Knowing about the fate of these photons is fundamental to understand both galaxy and cosmic evolution. The escape fraction of Ionizing Lyman continuum radiation from starburst galaxies generally is only a few percent, and appears to be \"trapped\". In contrast, discrete HII regions in ordinary star-forming galaxies seem to have substantial leakage of ionizing photons having long path lengths. Dr. Oey and her team investigate this contrasting behavior in different scale phenomena in order to improve our understanding of the fate of these energetic photons. Ultimately this can lead to an observationally tested description of the ultra-violet field emerging from different types of galaxies with different star-formation properties.\r\nThe team uses modern wide-field, narrow-band imaging technology to directly identify optically thin versus optically thick HII regions and to do ionization-parameter mapping. They plan to quantitatively parameterize the relation between nebular optical depth and cooler interstellar phases for the large and small Magellanic Clouds, and will directly measure optical depths for the nebular population of the nearby galaxies M31 and M33, again relating these to the interstellar medium environment.\r\nThe technique is also applied to nearby starburst galaxies to evaluate the escape of ionizing radiation and related ionization morphology. These results should have broad impact in the astrophysical community, since the fate of Lyman continuum radiation is one of the most important outstanding issues in cosmic evolution. Likewise, the results should contribute to the understanding of the ionization of the diffuse, warm ionized medium in star-forming galaxies. The project has impact on scales ranging from individual stars to the cosmos itself. The work builds directly on the Dr. Oey's comprehensive program on feedback from massive stars.\r\nThis project will use the Maryland-Magellan Tunable Narrow Band Filter, which was built with NSF support. A graduate student will be trained in the use of tunable filter devices, which are now being commissioned on existing and planned new-generation telescopes. The PI is involved in several outreach activities, including a partnership with the historic University of Michigan Detroit Observatory, which is starting to open its facilities to undergraduate students and the public. The continued involvement by the PI and her team with the University of Michigan Exhibit Museum of Natural History and more recently, the University of Michigan Museum Studies Program will advance science education in the museum environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe fate of ionizing ultraviolet (UV) radiation is one of the central questions in understanding cosmic evolution.  We see that the universe is bathed in this radiation, which must have escaped from early star-forming regions at cosmic dawn.  But what are the conditions allowing gas clouds to be transparent to UV radiation?  We first need to identify which clouds are transparent and which are not.\n\nWe have developed a new imaging technique to reveal the transparency of clouds to this UV radiation.  Since UV radiation from hot, massive stars can strip electrons from atomic nuclei, species with more stripped electrons are found nearest to the stars while fewer electrons are stripped at larger distances.  Thus, mapping nebulae in the light emitted by atomic species that are more stripped vs less stripped can show how far the UV light travels.  This mapping technique can also show whether UV light is likely to escape from the clouds altogether. \n\nTiny dust particles called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are also destroyed by UV radiation.  Ordinarily they exist on the periphery of nebular clouds since they are destroyed closer to the hot stars within these clouds.  If these PAHs are not observed even in the cloud periphery, we can infer that UV radiation has destroyed the PAHs beyond the cloud edges and is escaping into the environment beyond.  However, PAHs are made of heavier elements and they cannot form efficiently in environments where these elements are scarce.  We find that in these \"metal-poor\" environments, there are not enough PAHs for this technique to work.  This result also helps to clarify the origin of PAHs, implying that they form deep within molecular clouds.\n\nOur results will help to identify which clouds are transparent in the UV vs which are opaque, allowing us to further understand the conditions that allow for UV radiation to escape from clouds, into the environment, and ultimately, into the universe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sally Oey"
