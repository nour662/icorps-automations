 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Shareshian plans to work on four projects.  He will continue joint work with Michelle Wachs involving the use of quasisymmetric functions in various combinatorial, geometric and representation theoretic settings. The current main goal of this project is to show that the Frobenius characteristic of a representation of the symmetric group on the cohomology of a regular semisimple Hessenberg variety is a refinement of the chromatic symmetric function of a graph naturally associated to the variety.  Shareshian will continue joint work with Russ Woodroofe, in which two problems are studied.  The first problem is to show that the order complex of the coset poset of a finite group is never contractible.  This problem has been reduced by Shareshian and Woodroofe to a problem about prime divisors of indices of maximal subgroups of alternating groups.  The second problem is to develop a nongraded analog of Richard Stanley's theory of supersolvable lattices.  The main goal is to find a theory that both encompasses the already well-studied theory of left modular lattices and provides a better understanding of combinatorial properties of subgroup lattices of finite solvable groups.  Finally, Shareshian will attempt to settle a problem in topological combinatorics raised by Michael Aschbacher and Stephen Smith in their work on the Quillen Conjecture about the partially ordered set of p-subgroups of a finite group.\r\n\r\nShareshian studies connections between three areas of mathematics, namely, combinatorics, group theory and geometry.  Combinatorialists study discrete, usually finite, structures, often attempting to enumerate all such structures satisfying a given condition.  Combinatorial problems arise naturally in various areas of intellectual inquiry, including mathematics, computer science, physics and biology.  Group theorists study symmetry by encoding the symmetries of an object by an algebraic system, called a group.  Since humans are naturally drawn to highly symmetric objects and use symmetry to understand many scientific and aesthetic phenomena, group theory is ubiquitous.  It appears, for example, in many problems from physics and chemistry.  Geometers study shapes.  These shapes might live in spaces of high dimension and therefore be inaccessible to understanding through visualization.  Mathematicians often attempt to understand such shapes by associating to them algebraic systems in a way that provides useful information.  In some cases, these algebraic systems are best understood by associating to them combinatorial objects that encode the algebraic information relevant to the geometric problem at hand.  Shareshian examines combinatorial objects arising in this manner.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project funded by this grant involves relations between finite sets and high-dimensional geometric objects.  Geometry in high dimensions is of intrinsic interest in pure mathematics and arises frequently in applied mathematics. (Indeed, any time a parameter of interest depends on many other parameters, geometry in high dimensions can come into play.)\n\nAs our vision, which serves us well when we consider geometry in two or three dimensions, becomes less and less useful as the number of dimensions increases, mathematicians have developed various approaches to understanding objects of large dimension.  Two such approaches are as follows:\n\n1) A complicated geometric object can be broken up into finitely many pieces such that the geomtery of each piece is easy to understand, despite having high dimension.  (The pieces might be analogues in arbitrary dimension of points, lines, planes and the three-dimenisonal space we percieve visually.  In this case, one needs some way of understanding how the simple pieces are glued together to construct the more complicated object.)\n\n2) A complicated geometric object can be approximated by putting together pieces that, while high-dimensional, can be understood by recording a finite amount of information.  (Typically, these pieces are analogues in arbitrary dimension of points, line segments, triangles and tetrahedra.  For a \"toy example\", one can imagine appproximating a circle by marking some number of evenly spaced points on the circle and then drawing line segments between adjacent pairs of points.  As the number of points increases, the resulting polygon becomes closer and closer to the actual circle.  One can understand the polygon if one knows the locations of the finitely many points involved, as the line segments are determined by the points.)\n\nThe funded project led to results involving both of the approaches just described.  \n\nIn joint work with Michelle Wachs of the University of Miami, we explained how one might approach the study of symmetries of geometric objects called \"regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties\" by relating decompositions of the first type above to certain types of finite networks known as \"indifference graphs\".  This led to further work by mathematicians in several different fields: algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and topology.\n\nIn joint work with Russ Woodroofe (now at the University of Primorska in Slovenia) we explained how to use techniques from algebraic topology, an area of math in which approximations of the second type are often very useful, to understand a problem in an area of abstract algebra, group theory.\n\nIn addition to engaging in the research described above, the PI has been been ctive in undergraduate and graduate education.  While supported by the grant, the PI directed research done by ten undergraduate students.  Some of these students have entered very strong graduate programs in pure and applied mathematics, while others have taken jobs in industry in which mathematics plays a considerable role.
