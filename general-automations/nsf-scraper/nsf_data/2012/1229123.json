 "awd_abstract_narration": "With Major Research Instrumentation support, Dr. Anna B. Cieslicka and her collaborators will purchase a Biosemi Electroencephalography/Event Related Potentials (EEG/ERP) Active Two Acquisition System for the Psychology and Communication Department at Texas A&M International University (TAMIU), a Hispanic serving institution in South Texas. Event-related potentials (ERPs) have been critical in investigating language representation and processing since they provide a unique opportunity to \"watch\" language processing as it unfolds in real-time. The instrument provides a noninvasive technique for measuring electrical activity in the brain, localizing it in both time and space. This is recorded through a set of sensors which are placed on the surface of the scalp.\r\n\r\nThe participating researchers are all active researchers in the study of bilingualism and bilingual cognitive processing. Five collaborative research projects are proposed. Project 1 will explore hemispheric asymmetries (differences between the activation of the left and right cerebral hemispheres) in processing salient (highly familiar) and nonsalient (less familiar) meanings of idiomatic expressions by Spanish-English bilinguals. Findings from PI's earlier research will be verified with greater accuracy due to the superiority of the electroencephalography (EEG) methodology. Project 2 will investigate code-switching in bilinguals and explore how the factors of the direction of switching and language dominance affect fluent bilinguals' comprehension. A second goal of this project will be to address idiom decomposability, or the extent to which idioms are stored and processed as single linguistic units or assembled through linguistic and semantic analysis of their individual constituents. Overall, data obtained from Projects 1 and 2 will allow the PI and collaborators to start a pioneering research program into the electrophysiological correlates of bilingual figurative comprehension. Project 3 will examine the effects of valence and arousal on the mental representation of emotion words. The project will address the ways in which emotion words are distinct from each other, and how valence (positive versus negative) and arousal (low versus high) influence the overall representation of these words in human memory.  This work will have implications for the development of methods of learning different word classes and also for aiding memory improvement techniques by means of using emotion-related stimuli. Project 4 will further explore differences in the processing of positively and negatively valenced words in bilinguals' native and nonnative languages and will additionally explore the extent to which individual differences factors (e.g., perspective taking) modulate emotional word processing. Project 5 will address the question of whether linguistic perceivers rely on world knowledge and lexical information to comprehend linguistic statements. Using mono- and bilingual speakers, it will apply an EEG/ERP paradigm in combination with eye-tracking, to investigate whether the bilingual speakers' brain responses engage similar neural structures to understand ironic statements in both languages. This research will further understanding of the neural circuitries underlying language comprehension abilities in bilingual speakers.\r\n\r\nThe research and training program enabled by the equipment will foster intramural and extramural collaborations and increase TAMIU's competitiveness for extramural research funding and publishing. The instrumentation will provide training and access to mainstream electrophysiological methodologies to students that are historically underrepresented in psychology/ neuropsychology doctoral programs. In addition, the requested equipment will improve the university's research infrastructure by advancing numerous research programs in the cognitive sciences and related areas, and will enhance the educational experience of several undergraduate/graduate classes by enabling the creation of new courses in psychology and cognitive neuroscience.",

Specifically, we expected to: (1) continue to expand our bilingual language processing research; (2) provide a better understanding of the neurological mechanisms involved in the comprehension/storage of figurative language by bilinguals; (3) explore the influence of language dominance on figurative language comprehension; (4) provide training and access to mainstream electrophysiological methodologies to students that are historically underrepresented in psychology/neuropsychology doctoral programs; (5) increase the quality of existing psychology courses and enable the creation of new courses in psychology and cognitive neuroscience; (6) foster intramural and extramural collaborations; and (7) increase TAMIU&rsquo;s competitiveness for extramural research funding and publishing, so we can better serve the vibrant South Texas Spanish-English bilingual community. All of the objectives and goals have been successfully fulfilled. Throughout the grant period, we have conducted a number of psycholinguistic/language processing experiments with the use of the new equipment and expanded the research questions that we could address with the new technology. We engaged in extensive student and faculty training, providing workshops and training sessions for faculty, undergraduate, and graduate students. Overall, all of the Psychology faculty and a total of 30 students were trained and acquired sufficient skills to supervise, run, and design an EEG/ERP experiment on their own with the use of <em>Biosemi</em>. In addition, Undergraduate Research courses offered every semester were devoted exclusively to EEG/ERPs projects that undergraduate students got experience with. A thesis class taught by the PI was also entirely focused on the research carried out with the use of the <em>EEG/ERP Biosemi Active Two System</em>. One thesis has already been completed (pending defense) and another is still in progress.
