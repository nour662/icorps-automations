 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. McKee and his group investigate star formation and its history to study the processes governing the evolution of the universe. The star formation history determines the structure and evolution of galaxies, and the production of the chemical elements over time. This work addresses three central problems in the theory of star formation. \r\n(1) The role of magnetic fields in the formation of low-mass stars. Magnetic fields affect their formation as stars cannot from if the field is too strong. The group uses a numerical magneto-radiative hydrodynamic - adaptive mesh refinement code to simulate the effects of magnetic fields on star formation. Large scale star formation in giant molecular clouds is affected by the shape of the magnetic field in these clouds. Observations support both hypotheses that either the field is ordered or tangled. Detailed simulations will be compared to observations to resolve this issue. On intermediate scales, processes during star cluster formation influences the star formation rates and the stellar masses. Simulations that include the effects of radiation and outflows from protostars forming out of a magnetized medium will provide a more complete picture of star formation in clusters. One smaller scales, magnetic fields are effective at extracting the rotational energy of the gas in disks that have been observed around forming and recently formed stars. Most star formation simulations to date result in either no disks at all, or in disks that are much smaller than observed. Here high resolution simulations with all relevant physical processes that couple the gas to the magnetic field are carried out to address this issue.\r\n(2) The rate of star formation through cosmic time. The evolution of disk galaxies like the Milky Way depends on the rate at which gas accretes onto the galaxy and the rate at which this gas is transformed into stars. Gas accretion has been determined by large scale cosmological simulations. The PI has contributed to the development of two complementary theories of the star formation rate. These theories will be unified and, with simulations, extended to the case when heavy element abundances were low in the early universe. The results can serve as ingredients for more accurate theories of the evolution of galaxies.\r\n(3) The formation of the first stars. The very first stars formed out of gas that had essentially no elements heavier than Helium. When these stars exploded at the end of their lives, they seeded the universe with the first heavy elements. The amount of heavy elements produced depends sensitively on the mass of these stars. This mass was likely affected by of the energetic radiation emitted by the stars as they formed, which will be studied in the highest resolution simulations yet performed in order to determine the mass of the first stars.\r\nThis award supports a postdoctoral researcher. The computational methodologies developed as part of this project will be published for use by the community.",

The first stars formed shortly after the Big Bang, and stars are still forming today. &nbsp;The focus of the research supported by this grant was to address the question of how it is possible for stars to form out of the tenuous interstellar medium, which has a density so low that a cubic inch contains only about 20 atoms. Much of this research was carried out with a computer code, Orion, developed over the past two plus decades that can simulate the flow of cosmic gas under the influences of gravity, magnetic fields and radiation. How do magnetic fields, which permeate the Galaxy, affect star formation? Magnetic fields can be stronger than gravity, and in such regions stars cannot form. Using Orion, it was shown that in typical regions of the interstellar medium, magnetic fields slow star formation and reduce fragmentation, improving agreement with observation, but they do not stop star formation. Magnetic fields also slow the rate at which gas can accrete onto a star when it moves away from the region in which it was first formed. By carrying out a simulation that took months of time on a supercomputer, it was possible to create a computational model of a region of the interstellar medium that agreed well with observation, with the advantage that quantities such as the magnetic field could be measured in 3 dimensions in the simulation, whereas the most accurate observation of the interstellar magnetic field detects only the component of the field along the line of sight. The radiation emitted by stars as they form is a powerful feedback mechanism that has a major impact on the the mass of the stars that form. Orion simulations showed that radiative feedback in dense star-forming regions reduces fragmentation and produces stars with masses similar to those that are observed. Stars are observed to have masses up to more than 100 times the mass of the Sun. Such stars are so luminous that the pressure due to their radiation can be stronger than gravity, potentially preventing the formation of massive stars. &nbsp;After a major improvement in Orion's treatment of radiation, it was shown that the Rayleigh-Taylor instabiity (the same instability that allows water to fall out of a glass held upside down) plays an important role in enabling gas to accrete onto a massive star in the process of formation even when the radiation pressure is much greater than gravity. Star formation leads to planet formation, and a puzzle in the study of the many extrasolar planets that have been discovered is that the orbital plane of the planets can differ signficantly from the orientation of the spin of the star, contrary to what is seen in the solar system. It was shown that this could naturally result from the fact that the interstellar medium out of which the stars form is turbulent. The very first stars formed differently than stars today: It is believed that they formed inside clumps of dark matter, which is of unknown composition but is about 5 times more abundant than the matter we see. The effects of radiation that destroys molecules and ionizes gas and of X-rays and cosmic rays produced by other sources on the formation of the first stars were investigated. The discovery of gravitational waves has opened a new window in astronomy, and it was shown that some of these waves could be due to mergers of primordial binary stars. In other work, a new determination of the amount of dark matter in the solar vicinity was made based on an improved analysis of the amount of normal matter there, and it was shown that observations of the hot gas around the Galaxy imply that the mass of this gas matches the value &nbsp;expected from the amount of dark matter around the Galaxy.<br />Broader Impacts: Research in astronomy and astrophysics is critical in developing the evolving view that our civilization has of its position in the universe.
