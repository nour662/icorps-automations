 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract (Proposal No. 1202193)  \r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This proposal addresses a new method of integrated design and implementation of an external passive radiometer for monitoring internal body temperature. The goal for the proposed research is to develop a temperature-monitoring device with a potential of being wearable, disposable and inexpensive. The motivating applications are in several areas: (1) medical diagnostics, e.g. monitoring infant brain damage, arthritis, detecting localized tumors and monitoring temperature rise during hyperthermia treatment; (2) monitoring people under stress, e.g., athletes during training/competition, emergency workers and military personnel in hazardous conditions; and (3) manufacturing, e.g., monitoring internal temperature of foods during the manufacturing process. The specific issues addressed in the project are the basic understanding of principles and limitations of near-field microwave radiometry, an engineering approach for monitoring internal body temperature in an environment with radio interference. The anticipated result of the research is development of a wearable and ultimately disposable radiometric thermometer for a wide range of applications, with a spatial resolution on the order of 1cm and temperature resolution of 0.1K. The radiometer data can easily be transmitted using a low-power wireless transceiver for further off-body processing.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The broader impacts of the proposed research are transformative in several areas. The technical goal of providing a new method of non-invasive monitoring of internal temperature, when applied to a human body, can lead to on-time preventive treatment. Not having access to internal body temperature is not only a problem for various diseases, but also has a considerable impact in national security (military personnel under heavy training; emergency personnel in hazardous conditions). In terms of education and outreach, the broader impacts include multi-disciplinary education at the undergraduate and graduate level, spanning areas of high-frequency analog circuit design, electromagnetic simulations, and metrology. An impact on the institution will be development of core competency in the field and interactions with existing research projects. The PI has been active in outreach, and related to this proposed work plans to add a new module to the existing K-12 outreach, entitled Hot inside?, where children can use a radiometer to ?see? a hot spot inside an object. A collaboration with NIST-Boulder will enhance the metrology component of the research. The international component of the proposed effort includes a collaboration with ETH-Zurich (Switzerland), in the form of student exchanges, software donations and no-cost participation.",

The motivating applications are in several areas: (1) medical diagnostics, e.g. monitoring infant brain damage, arthritis, detecting localized tumors and monitoring temperature rise during hyperthermia treatment; (2) monitoring people under stress, e.g., athletes during training/competition, emergency workers and military personnel in hazardous conditions; and (3) manufacturing, e.g., monitoring internal temperature of foods during the manufacturing process.</p>\n<p>The fundamental principle of operation is based on natural non-zero temperature electromagnetic (black-body) radiation from all tissue layers, and the fact that lower microwave frequencies penetrate several centimeters of a layered lossy dielectric. This radiated power from internal body tissues, e.g. the heart, can be measured with a sensitive receiver called a radiometer. A radiometer measures the total power received from all layers, which is proportional to the weighted sum of the layer temperatures. The inverse problem of determining separate temperatures associated with each tissue layer (e.g. skin, fat, bone?) is solved by obtaining weighting functions through full-wave electromagnetic simulations. The research goals are to: develop an understanding of sensitivity limitations of the method; effective inverse problem solution; implementation of the radiometer and its calibration; validation by measurements and development of a wearable device that can continuously monitor relative core body temperature.</p>\n<p>The challenges that were overcome during the project include analyzing complex tissue properties and associated low radiated power (about&nbsp; -100dBm at 1.4GHz), loss due to attenuation in tissue layers, and the difficulty in detecting small power variation (&lt;0.05dB) due to temp variation of muscle under a thick layer of skin and fat. The probe design is another challenge, and the demonstrated probes maximize received noise power from deep tissue layers in the near field, are able to reduce radio-frequency interference (RFI), provide shielding/filtering and are small in size for wearability. The radiometers that were developed from off-the-shelf components have a very high sensitivity, are stable despite high gain requirements, are shielded from RFI and have small size and low power consumption. Finally, the temperature retrieval includes algorithms for solving the near-field inverse problem based on knowledge of tissue layer thickness and their electromagnetic properties.</p>\n<p>The probe design includes a superstrate for increased focusing of reception into sub-surface tissues, and a ground plane for RFI shielding. It is planar and easy to manufacture and mount on the skin, and the feed impedance is matched to the probe when placed on the body, as validated by measurements. To validate the reception of black-body radiation from buried tissue layers, reciprocity between absorption and emission is used, with 5W of power input to the probe placed on a phantom tissue stack. A liquid crystal sheet inserted into the phantom was used to measure the temperature profile and compare it to simulations, with good agreement, validating the near-field probe design.</p>\n<p>The microwave thermometer was first tested on a three-layer phantom tissue stack consisting of skin (salmon), fat (dielectric) and muscle (saline), where the muscle phantom temperature was varied periodically and the temperature monitored with the radiometer and with independent thermocouples. The radiometer with probe positioned on the skin tracked the muscle temperature within 0.5K instantaneously, while the thermocouple on the skin only measured conduction at a much longer timescale. Calibrated measurements on three-layer, two-layer and single-layer phantoms were performed and successfully validated the operation of the microwave thermometer. Measurements were done in a low RFI environment first, and then a second probe with RFI cancelation algorithms was implemented for operation in an open environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, a wearable device was assembled by a team of undergraduate students and tested on the human cheek. The temperature inside the cheek can be varied when a person keeps hot or cold water in their mouth, and this can be measured with the external radiometer, as well as with an independent thermocouple placed inside the mouth. The wearable radiometer has the ability to track the temperature in-vivo when placed on the cheek. Remaining challenges include further miniaturization and easy calibration, and these are undertaken by a small company based in Boulder, Colorado (gaugewear, Inc., founder Jeff Wallingford) as a part of technology transfer and commercialization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zoya&nbsp;Popovic</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202193/1202193_10165776_1540811704278_Figure1-Thermometer--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202193/1202193_10165776_1540811704278_Figure1-Thermometer--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ThermometerPrinciple\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202193/1202193_10165776_1540811704278_Figure1-Thermometer--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ThermometerPrinciple\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Illustration of developed microwave thermometer for internal body temperature monitoring.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">William Haines</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zoya&nbsp;Popovic</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ThermometerPrinciple</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202193/1202193_10165776_1540811787792_Figure2-Radiometer--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202193/1202193_10165776_1540811787792_Figure2-Radiometer--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Radiometer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1202193/1202193_10165776_1540811787792_Figure2-Radiometer--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Radiometer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Block diagram of microwave thermometer with photo of radiometer designed with off-the-shelf components.
