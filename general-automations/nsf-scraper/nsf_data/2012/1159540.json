 "awd_abstract_narration": "1159540\r\nRamasamy\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop an electrochemical biosensing system to detect a volatile\r\ncompound released by plants. The volatile chemical signature of plants carries unique\r\ninformation that can be helpful in the identification of the state-of-heath of the plant. Detection of\r\nthis signature can advance our understanding of the ?plant language? and will eventually help in\r\nthe development of real-time health monitoring systems for large-scale agriculture. The\r\nproposed work integrates material science, biochemistry and electrochemistry to develop a\r\nnanostructured platform for amperometric biosensing. Successful completion of the proposed\r\nwork will result in a novel bi-enzyme based electrochemical biosensor with tunable properties.\r\nThe hybrid composite nanomaterial interfaces to be developed in this project will provide\r\nmultiple benefits and can be applied to other bio-electrochemical systems. The proposed work\r\nwill directly impact the field of agriculture and forestry. The project will also have broader\r\ninfluence in the development of enzyme-based biosensors. The proposed project will provide\r\neducation and training for graduate and undergraduate students and post-docs. Results from\r\nthe project will be broadly disseminated through conference presentations, seminars and\r\nscientific publications. The proposed outreach activities will provide a social impact on the high\r\nschool students in the state of Georgia.",
