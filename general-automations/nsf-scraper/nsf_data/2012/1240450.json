 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports US faculty members and graduate students to attend USA - Sino Summer School in Vision, Learning, Pattern Recognition (VLPR2012). The VLPR summer school has become a mutually beneficial annual event for computer vision researchers and students from both US and China. The impact and reputation of VLPR summer school sequence grows rapidly and VLPR 2012 continues this positive trend by focusing on Computer Vision in Biomedical Image Applications: from Micro to Macro. This topic complements the methodology-centered VLPRs in the past with an application-oriented and human-centered focus on life forms in drastically different scales: from human and animals (macro) to cells (micro). VLPR 2012 aims to illustrate a cross-sectional state of the art computer vision and machine learning methodologies, to broaden the horizon for innovations and creativities, and to address some fundamental issues of high throughput computing on multi-modality, high-dimensional, and high volume image data (Big Data). \r\n\r\nThe theme of this summer school reflects the growing international trend of interdisciplinary research in biomedical image and smart health, and facilitates collaborative efforts between science and technology, computer science and medicine/biology, and US and China. In addition, this summer school offers a great opportunity for intellectual and cultural exchanges between a group of world-class computer vision researchers and motivated students from the two countries to converse and mingle with each other in an exciting, culturally rich environment during a week-long period.",

I think they enjoyed talking with us as much as we enjoyed talking with them.\"\n\n \n\nCulture and food\n\n \n\n\"Experiencing the culture was a great experience. Most of our meals at restaurants were\n\ncommunity style, which was a bit different for me, but fine nonetheless. The food was excellent and all our hosts went very much out of their way to accommodate us, which was really appreciated. I really enjoyed the day trip to Suzhuo to see the garden and temple. Our guide was informative, funny, and did a good job explaining the history. During the lunch that day , the \"squirrel fish\" was by far a favorite among all the students, and it didn\u00c6t go unnoticed how the organizers of VLPR treated us very well.\"\n\n \n\nConclusion\n\nThe popularity VLPR 2012 reflects the growing international trend of interdisciplinar..."
