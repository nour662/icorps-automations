Much of the funding will be directed to young mathematicians (i.e., postdocs, graduate students, junior faculty) who do not have their own support. \r\n\r\nThis year's school will introduce a number of areas of active research at a level accessible to young mathematicians; the target audience will be specifically strong graduate students and recent postdocs. The school will be organized around four mini-courses. Each will be given by an expert in the field who is known for their pedagogical skills. More precisely, the program will include the following:\r\n1. Hypothesis testing and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics by Yoshiko Ogata (University of Tokyo).\r\n2. Derivation of effective evolution equations from quantum dynamics by Benjamin Schlein (Universitat Bonn).\r\n3. Random Schrodinger operators by Simone Warzel (Technische Universitat Munchen).\r\n4. The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation and its universality class by Jeremy Quastel (University of Toronto).\r\n\r\nThe school will afford many junior researchers the opportunity to learn and interact with established researchers in analysis and mathematical physics. It will be an event with significant research and training impact.",
