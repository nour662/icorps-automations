 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this project is to develop and implement a new model for sustainable, cost-, energy- and resource-efficient nitrogen removal using the process of anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox). Anammox presents a cost-effective and energy-efficient alternate for biological nitrogen removal (BNR) relative to conventional approaches, which rely upon sequential nitrification and denitrification. Additionally, anammox bacteria by themselves do not produce nitrous oxide, thereby resulting in a lower greenhouse footprint of anammox BNR processes. The primary focus of this project is the development and application of a new model of wastewater treatment based on anaerobic conversion of ammonia to nitrogen gas, using the anammox process. Specifically, this project aims develop the design configurations, monitoring and control tools that could enable widespread improvements to the current wastewater treatment infrastructure by systematic application of anammox. \r\n\r\nThe adequate management of nitrogen pollution is a significant societal and technological challenge. The USEPA is now considering enforcing more widespread implementation of BNR across the nation in an effort to improve water quality. However, BNR processes are rather energy and resource intensive. Therefore, if not optimally designed and implemented, BNR processes might place an inordinate burden upon the nation's already strained resources. This project plans to develop and implement anammox based process technologies, to ensure that water quality objectives are not in conflict with energy and resource needs.",

Energy is required to purify water and in the US, significant amounts of water are needed for energy production. \n\nBased on a separate NSF CBET project, Dr. Chandran is developing a new model for reducing the energy and cost associated with current water infrastructure models.  This NSF I-Corps project facilitated the development of a commerical vehicle to dissemminate this new model and the technologies that form the basis for this model.  Specifically, as part of this NSF I-Corps project a business model for the effective implementation of novel bioprocess technologies for biological nitrogen removal as well as sustained biological monitoring were developed. \n\nThis NSF I-Corps project supported the professional development of a post-doctoral scientist in Prof. Chandran's research group.  Notably, this NSF I-Corps project provided a new dimension of entrepreneurship to the PI and post-doctoral scientist working on the project.  This NSF I-Corps project is expected to have a lasting impression on the PI's thinking and permeate into his technology development and commercialization activities for several years to come.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/22/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kartik Chandran"
