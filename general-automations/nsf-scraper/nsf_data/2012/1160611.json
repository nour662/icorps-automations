 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the collisions of atoms, molecules, and electrons, with an eye towards calculating the cross sections and relative branching ratios of different processes that might occur.  These processes primarily include dissociation.  Such calculations are generally complicated because one must include the effects of not only bound states but also states with free electrons.  Potential degeneracies also complicate the analysis.  In this research project, the group aims to use modern ab initio techniques in order to explore the flow of energy in such atomic/molecular systems and to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the interactions between their different components. As such, this work will involve studies of dissociative recombination, the excitation of molecules by high-energy photon impact, and photodetachment of polyatomic systems.  This also includes predicting angular distributions from fixed-in-space molecules with extensions to the process of radiative attachment.\r\n\r\nThis work is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  This research will enhance infrastructure for research and education.  Moreover, the group maintains a strong collaboration with international partners, in particular the experimental and theory groups in Sweden, the TSR in Germany, and with theoreticians at the Universite de Havre, France.",
