 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is graduating bachelor-degreed science majors from rural backgrounds, or as first-generation college graduates, and is especially welcoming women participants who make up a large fraction of their student body.  Viterbo University is awarding scholarships to two cohorts of 12 students each, to receive four years of support and is enrolling students who are pursuing degrees in biochemistry, chemistry, or mathematical physics.  The CLASS (Community of Learners Achieving Science Success) scholars are students with a high school GPA of at least 3.3, an ACT score of 24 or above, and who have documented financial need.  Using their experience in working with students underrepresented in the physical sciences, Viterbo is supporting the students academically so they overcome any deficiencies in preparation and is offering peer mentoring, undergraduate research opportunities, and social motivation to enhance the students' retention and success. Viterbo is enabling the CLASS scholars who elect to conduct undergraduate research to present or publish their findings in a peer-reviewed forum.  The CLASS scholars are part of a Community of Learners that has interventions in college orientation and study skill development, as well as aggressive mathematics and science tutoring.  The project is also offering job shadowing, introduction to diverse science careers, active peer mentoring, and opportunities for science-based service learning.\r\n\r\nThe project is extending findings from a prior S-STEM award and is being led by a well-qualified team experience in working with talented but under-prepared students.  It continues to add to the knowledge base of how to enhance the opportunities for success in science education, particularly for first-generation students from rural backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe project is leading to increased participation of underrepresented students in the physical sciences.  The project is on a clear trajectory to contribute to a more diversified pool of STEM graduate students or to a highly-qualified and diversified STEM workforce, both of which are addressing national needs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nViterbo University received nearly $600 thousand in founding through the NSF S-STEM Program to provide scholarships and programming in order to support two cohorts of twelve students through their undergraduate journeys to become successful scientists.  Students were selected from incoming chemistry, biochemistry, and mathematical physics freshmen based on academic strength and financial need with the expectation that many would be first generation college students.  Goals of the grant were five-fold:  increase enrollment of these majors at Viterbo University; support science students so they may overcome deficits in preparation to graduate as science majors; retain science students to graduation through social motivation, peer mentoring, and service learning; provide relevant undergraduate research experiences that result in peer-reviewed publications or presentation, encouraging students to pursue careers in research; graduate well-prepared science students and assist them in obtaining employment or further education in their chosen fields.  to achieve these goals, students formed strong learning communities that were initiated through freshmen orientation retreats, living together in a single wing of the dorm, mandatory tutoring, intensive advising, participation in science outreach activities, freshman-level Science Success and sophomore-level Careers in the Sciences courses, and graduate/professional school visits. \n\nThrough the course of the grant, 100% of CLASS Scholars participated in at least one undergraduate research project.  20% particpated in research outside of Viterbo University (through REU or other programs).  20% particpated in a STEM internship.\n\nSince dissemination of research is a critical part of the research process, we encouraged CLASS Scholars to present their research.  100% of CLASS Scholars presented their research at Seven Rivers Regional Research Symposium or at Scholar's Day, both sponsored by Viterbo University.  44% presented research at at regional or national meeting not associated with Viterbo University. \n\nAs of May 2017, twenty-four CLASS Scholars received a degree in the natural sciences from Viterbo University.  From the first cohort (2016 graduates), 8 students are enrolled in graduate or professional school, 2 have full-time employment in the field, 1 is obtaining a post-bac in secondary science education, 1 is participating in humanitarian service work, and none are looking for employment.  From the second cohort (2017 graduates), 4 students are enrolled in graduate or professional school, 4 have full-time employment in the field, 1 is participating in humanitarian service work, and 3 are looking for employment in the field.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tammy Clark"
