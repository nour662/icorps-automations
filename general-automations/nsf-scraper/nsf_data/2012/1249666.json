The first CRYPTO was held in 1981, and since then CRYPTO has been IACR's flagship conference, attracting researchers in the field of cryptology from all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe scope of research papers accepted to CRYPTO range from theoretical foundation of cryptology to application and implementation of cryptographic schemes. This grant supports student attendance at CRYPTO.  Students will have the opportunity to interact with many of the luminaries in the field during conference presentations, special tutorial sessions on hot topics, as well as in more informal settings including a reception and banquet dinners.",
