 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use waste methane gas\r\n(biogas) as a feedstock to produce pellets of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a valuable\r\npolymer that is converted into a variety of eco-friendly plastic products such as\r\nchildren?s toys, electronic casings, water bottles, and food packaging. The current\r\nplastics market is dominated by traditional petroleum-derived, non-biodegradable,\r\nenergy-intensive plastics. Alternative plastics are derived from rapidly renewable\r\nbiological resources (biobased) and consumed by microbes when no longer needed\r\n(biodegradable). Unfortunately, these alternative plastics are often costly and energyintensive\r\nto produce. The company has a novel, energy-efficient method to produce a\r\nbiodegradable, biobased plastic at a cost competitive with petroleum-based plastics.\r\nPhase I will assess the feasibility of this novel process for full-scale commercial\r\nproduction using biogas from a wastewater treatment plant. The main objective is to\r\nachieve stable-operation and increased bioplastic production through optimization of\r\nparameters including biological yields, rates, and costs at the Phase I scale. This\r\noptimization will result in the production of bioplastic from waste biogas at a price\r\ncompetitive with petroleum-based plastics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will ultimately be the widespread\r\nproduction of low-cost bioplastics from waste biogas and the eventual displacement of\r\npetroleum-based plastics. Bioplastics have the potential to capture an increasing\r\nfraction of the plastics market, thereby giving consumers the choice to purchase\r\naffordable, environmentally friendly, bioplastic-based products. When bioplastic\r\nproducts produced by the company are disposed in modern wastewater treatment\r\nplants or landfills, they biodegrade anaerobically (without oxygen) to methane. This\r\nmethane can be cycled back and reenter the process as feedstock to produce more\r\nPHA. Thus, the life cycle may be closed, creating a ?cradle to cradle? system. This use\r\nof biogas will provide a strong economic incentive for facilities to capture their methane,\r\nrather than releasing or flaring it, which will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and\r\nreduce corresponding impacts on global warming. The innovation will enhance scientific\r\nunderstanding by studying the production of bioplastic from waste biogas and by\r\ncharacterizing the microbial species responsible for this conversion. This project\r\nrepresents one of the first times that waste biogas will be used commercially to feed a\r\ncommunity of bacteria to produce a valuable product.",
