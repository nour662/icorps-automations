 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program in Physics at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) and Duke University. TUNL is a research consortium consisting of three major universities in the North Carolina Triangle Area, Duke University, North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The program will provide opportunities for a total of 12 students to participate in research on a broad range of topics in nuclear and particle physics. Eight students will conduct research at TUNL, and the other four will spend part of their summer at CERN working with the Duke high-energy physics group. This REU summer program provides undergraduate students with an active research experience through the completion of a self-contained 10-week project. Each student is assigned a faculty mentor and is integrated into a research group consisting of faculty, postdocs, graduate students and other undergraduate students. In addition, the students have opportunities to learn about the graduate programs at the consortium institutions.   Through active research, seminars, lab tours, and discussion groups, the students are exposed to various aspects of nuclear and particle physics research and their connections to other science areas. Lecture and seminar topics are chosen to emphasize the nuclear and particle physics research activities at TUNL and CERN, respectively. Both student groups will have opportunities to work with state-of-the-art technologies used in these lines of research.",

The site was located at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) and the physics department at Duke University in Durham, NC.  The TUNL is a research consortium consisting of three major universities in the North Carolina Triangle Area: Duke University, North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC).  The combination of the TUNL research community and the High-Energy Physics (HEP) group in the Duke physics department creates an educationally rich research environment for students.\n\nStudents participated in a 10-week long summer program that focused on research and included lectures for specialized training and educational broadening and social activities for community building. Each student was assigned a faculty mentor and was integrated into a research group consisting of faculty, postdocs, graduate students and other undergraduate students.   This arrangement was intended to give the students a sense of what it\u00c6s like to be a graduate student conducting research at the frontiers of the field.\n\nThis REU site had both domestic and international components.  The students who conducted research in experimental nuclear physics worked at TUNL or with the neutrino-physics group at Duke University.   Those conducting research in particle physics worked with the Duke HEP group and spent part of the summer at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.  Also, some students conducted research in theoretical physics with groups at Duke University and the UNC.  The funding by the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the site provided support for 12 undergraduate physics students to conduct research in the program each summer in 2012, 2013 and 2014, i.e., a total of 36 students participated in the project over its three-year duration.  In addition, the infrastructure maintained for the program benefited other students conducting research at the TUNL institutions each summer.  These students were supported by other funding sources.  Photographs of the participants in each summer are attached. \n\nEight of the 12 students supported by the NSF each summer conducted research in nuclear physics.

Most of those who decided not to attend graduate school immediately after completing their undergraduate studies are working in STEM areas.  Several students are co-authors on papers in research journals that resulted from their REU research project.    \n\nIntellectual Merit: This program provided opportunities for undergraduate students to conduct research at the frontiers of nuclear and particle physics wit..."
