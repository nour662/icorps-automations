 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to study several questions involving arithmetic aspects of\r\nmaps between algebraic varieties.  These questions include new far-reaching\r\ngeneralizations of major results about abelian varieties, including the\r\nMordell--Lang conjecture (Faltings' theorem) and Merel's uniform boundedness\r\ntheorem for rational torsion on elliptic curves over a number field.  In the\r\ngeneralizations, the group structure in an abelian variety is replaced by\r\nobjects which exist in any variety.  The PI's study of maps between varieties\r\nwill yield results about dynamical systems, Diophantine equations,\r\nautomorphism groups of curves, and value distribution of meromorphic functions.\r\n\r\nPolynomials whose coefficients are rational numbers are a fundamental\r\ntool in many aspect of modern life, ranging from\r\ninformation security to weather prediction.  These basic objects have been\r\nintensively studied for over two thousand years, but recent years have seen\r\nthe discovery of previously unexpected phenomena.  The proposed research will\r\nexamine these fundamental objects from several perspectives.  This will likely\r\nyield immediate consequences in computer science, in addition to long-term\r\nconsequences across many disciplines.  Finally, much of the proposed research\r\nwill be carried out jointly with graduate and undergraduate students, so that\r\nit will make an educational contribution in addition to its scientific impact.\r\n\r\n",
