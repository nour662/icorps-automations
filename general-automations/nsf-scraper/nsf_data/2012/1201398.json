All of the conference topics are central to analysis and extremely active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.",

These complexity and algorithmic questions are &ndash;needless to say&ndash; central. The development of computers in the last 50 years has made their consideration crucial. The practical resolution of the polynomial questions requires the constant development of more high-performance algorithms, which in their turn require the development of a suitable original mathematical theory and the use of techniques coming from different fields. Even a proper foundational setting is still missing for some aspects of the analysis of these problems. \n\nThe field of Dynamical Systems has its origins in early efforts toestablish the stability of the solar system.  Early pioneers such as Henri Poincare and George Birkhoff discovered mechnanisms for stability and instability, thus initiating the study of hyperbolic dynamical systems. Around the same time, the geometer Eberhard Hopf used hyperbolic methods to study the long-term behavior of geodesics (straight lines) in negatively-curved spaces (such as those modelled on Minkowski spacetime).   A century later, the study of hyperbolic dynamical systems has blossomed into a mature field, one of the cornerstones of dynamics.   \n\nParallel issues arise in the rigorous study of both Complexity in Dynamics: robustness (stability) of results, estimation of rate of convergence of algorithms, and prediction of \"typical\" (i.e. generic) behavior.  The intersections of these methods emerged as a central theme and was addressed in several talks, among them:\n\nShmuel Weinberger\nFrom Complexity to Geometry: Disordered Solids.\n\nKe Zhang \nArnold Diffusion via Invariant Cylinders and Mather Variational Method\n\nJana Rodriguez Hertz\nPartial hyperbolicity and the topology of 3-manifolds\n\nSaugata Basu\nA B-S-S analogue of Valiant: complexity theory of constructible functions and sheaves\n\nJim Renegar\nOptimization, Then and Now\n\n\nPascal Koiran\nProgress on the real tau conjecture\n\nMaria Jose Pacifico\nA toy model for flows with equilibria attached to regular orbits\n\nA total of 31 talks were held, with plenary talks in the morning followed by parallel sessions in the afternoon.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe conference was attended by approximately 200 participants and was widely and effectively advertised on the conference website:\n\nhttp://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/11-12/dynamics2complexity/\n\nThe grant subsized participation by 7 women who had no direct grant support, and many additional early-career researchers without outside support.  Two of the four main organizers were women, and this was reflected in the high turnout of women and a general atmosphere of incluseiveness  at the conference.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/06/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne M Wilkinson"
