 "awd_abstract_narration": "CURE is a year-round (though summer-centered) REU site that provides Astronomy-based research opportunities at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for underserved community college students from selected colleges in the Los Angeles area. Students (approximately 8 per year) work full time for 10 weeks during the summer, and have the option of continuing part-time during the academic year under the supervision of JPL scientists on various Astronomy-related projects, both at JPL and at JPL's Table Mountain Observatory. Research topics include high precision astrometry of occulting asteroids, photometry of near-Earth asteroids, design and testing of a compact Doppler magnetograph, and research into space optical communications systems.\r\n\r\nCURE students are drawn exclusively from community colleges. In addition to being remarkably diverse in virtually every way, these students have often overcome great obstacles and challenges to get where they are. CURE provides them with a priceless opportunity to experience real science and real research ? an opportunity usually available only to four-year college and university students. In addition to providing underserved and minority students (many of whom are first generation college students) with valuable professional research experience, CURE's impact extends beyond the students it serves.  CURE connects community college faculty with cutting-edge research, keeping them up-to-date in the field, strengthens the relationship between community colleges and professional researchers, and provides valuable inspiration, incentive and modeling to all STEM students at the participating community colleges.",
