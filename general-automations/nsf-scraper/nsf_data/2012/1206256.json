 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description: The goal of this research project is to develop a novel method to place controlled amounts of substitutional impurities into graphene grown on SiC, to physically and electronically characterize the doped structures, and to evaluate the changes in the film's properties. Impurities are implanted into a SiC wafer prior to graphene formation. The wafer is annealed to bring the impurity distribution near the surface. Then graphene is grown by sublimation of Si, simultaneously driving the impurities into the graphene film. After this process, the impurity distribution is characterized by surface analytical techniques as well as by electrical transport measurements. If successful, the method can also be applied to other two-dimensional materials.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description: Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms bound together in a honeycomb lattice structure, has unique electrical and mechanical properties. Effective use of these properties requires the inclusion of predetermined amounts of impurity atoms (doping) in the films. The project develops a new method to incorporate controlled amounts of atoms into a single atomic layer of graphene, and provides graduate student training in an interdisciplinary environment. In addition, undergraduate students at the University of Minnesota and at Rutgers University, as well as high school teachers working at Georgia Tech, obtain direct hands-on research experience in the project as well as study materials and new understanding resulting from the project in courses taught by the principal investigators.",

Two dimensional materials (one to a few atomic layers thick) are thought to be one of the paths to such enhanced performance. One candidate, identified a few years ago, was graphene, a two dimensional form of carbon atoms which has demonstrated extraordinary electron mobility and speed. Unfortunately graphene does not show the characteristic property of a semiconductor, namely a band gap.\n\nThis collaborative research project is directed to the synthesis of new forms of graphene, possibly with the creation of a form with a band-gap.

The indication of a bandgap was attributed in part, to the strain that accompanies this particular graphene growth. First measurements were in disordered forms of the material, a natural property of the growth mode.

The Rutgers contribution to this collaborative project is to develop the SiC base lithography.\n\nSpecific results indicated two forms of He based lithography applicable to the program. In the first case arrays of SiC dimples were formed with 10-30 nm spacing exploiting the gas pressure associated with the subsurface implanted He. These arrays were examined by atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Over-layers of graphene placed on the dimple array were shown to indeed be strained by Raman spectroscopy. A second mode of strain creation exploited the formation of valleys and tranches, also to be studied using over-layer graphene.\n\nThe He ion energy dependence and the to..."
