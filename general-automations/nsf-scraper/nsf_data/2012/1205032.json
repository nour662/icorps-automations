For a period of three to four weeks, students focus on a single technical issue. They form teams, do research, and plan solutions. Additionally the students practice, document, and present their solutions in teams for feedback. The final part of this process is that our center &ldquo;pops-up&rdquo; and opens its doors to help customers with that particular issue. Examples include wiping hard drives, upgrading operating systems and installing memory. We have found that at the end of this process, the students are able and prepared to solve the problem for real-life customers. The location of the pop-up can vary, for example, an empty classroom, open lab or other student area.
