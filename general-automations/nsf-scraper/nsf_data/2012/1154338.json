REFLECT is assisting students in completing associate and baccalaureate degrees in the selected majors by awarding scholarships that support students for two years of study. Students may use both years of scholarships at BHCC, or use the second of the two years at a four-year school of their choice. REFLECT's significant efforts through the Boston Area Advanced Technological Education Connections (BATEC)  and program articulation agreements are ensuring that scholarship recipients have significant opportunities to pursue a four-year degree. REFLECT is also creating leadership opportunities for students by developing new models of peer support, including an on-line mentoring community led by scholarship recipients. REFLECT is employing best practices developed in part through successful ATE- and LSAMP-funded programs and activities currently offered at BHCC to support students financially, academically, and socially as they complete their degrees. These students are being prepared for employment in high demand technical areas. These models of student support are being documented and assessed for their success in promoting degree completion among a high-need urban student population.",
