In light of the current research thrust of nanofluidic proteomics, it becomes critically important to understand molecular transport properties in constraining nanofluidic sieving environments. Thus, the major goal of this research is to study, both experimentally and theoretically, molecular dynamics in confining nanofluidic environments and how such knowledge can be utilized to design novel nanofluidic sieving structures for advanced bioseparation. Different micro- and nano-fabrication methods will be applied to generate sub-100 nm nanofluidic sieving structures. These nanofluidic structures will be carefully examined to investigate how their separation performances (such as size selectivity and separation resolution) are affected by different structural parameters of the nanofluidic structures and the external electric fields. Experimental results will be used to guide developments of kinetic models and further validate them. Reciprocally, predictions from theoretical modeling will be used to motivate new separation assays and guide improved designs and generations of the nanofluidic sieving structures. The two-way validation process between experiments and theoretical modeling will lead to a rigorous understanding of molecular dynamics in the confining nanofluidic geometry.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Owing to its cross-disciplinary nature, the proposed research will seamlessly integrate knowledge from distinct fields including micro/nanofabrication, micro/nanofluidics, hindered transport, polymer physics, and fluorescence imaging of single molecules. The proposed research, if successful, will foster transformative progress for separation of physiologically-relevant molecules using synthetic nanofluidic structures, a critical step toward fulfilling the promise of the nanofluidic proteomic research and future highly integrated bioanalysis micro/nanosystems. The proposed research will also lead to a thorough understanding of molecular dynamics in the confining nanofluidic geometry, which could provide a novel basis for ultra-sensitive and high-resolution sensors and medical diagnostic systems. The proposed educational activities will have broad impacts on students from different educational levels and genders and ethnicities. Some of the technologies described in the proposal will be used as vehicles for outreach activities to K-12 students and other underrepresented female and minority students in the Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti school districts. The proposed outreach activities will reveal to K-12 students the exciting challenges in science and engineering and their close relevance to our society, thus motivating them to pursue science and engineering curricula. For undergraduate and graduate education, an interdisciplinary course in Micro/Nanofluidics and BioMEMS will be developed. This course will prepare engineering students to pursue research in a variety of multidisciplinary areas such as BioMEMS and Lab-on- Chip, analytical chemistry, and micro/nanoscale materials sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This research is to leverage recent advances in micro/nanoscale fabrication to develop nanoscale sieving structures for efficient separation of biomolecules based on size.   Specifically, this research has studied, both experimentally and theoretically, transport properties of biomolecules in nanofluidic structures and how such size-dependent molecular dynamics can be leveraged for efficient separation of biomolecules based on size.  We have applied advanced sub-100 nm lithography tools to generate nanofluidic devices with different structural values and compared their separation performances.  Experimental results are used to guide developments of theoretical models and further validate them.  Development of efficient nanofluidic sieving structures represents a major step toward optimizing bioseparation methods and integrating them onto a fully integrated bioanalysis microsystem. \nIntellectual Merit Outcome: Efficient methods for separating and purifying biomolecules from a complex mixture are of the utmost importance in biology and biomedical science.  However, conventional biomolecule separation methods suffer from the limitations of poor separation resolution and difficult sample recovery, making these methods suboptimal in separating complex mixtures for downstream analysis.  Recently, there has been great interest in developing micro/nanoscale patterned regular sieving structures to achieve superior bioseparation performance.  In this research, we have specifically designed and fabricated one- and two-dimensional nanofluidic filter (nanofilter)-based sieving structures using advanced nanofabrication tools to achieve superior separation performance for different types of biomolecules, including both DNA and proteins.  Our research has made these significant contributions: (1) Integrating micro/nanofabrication and nanofluidics with polymer physics:  The fundamental insights generated from our research will benefit future bioanalysis microsystems and understanding of intracellular and extracellular transport.  (2) Advancing understanding of molecular dynamics in constrained environments: Our research have developed theoretical models from the first principles to understand molecular dynamics and stochastic motion in the nanofluidic geometry.  Our theoretic efforts will provide practical approaches and rational design guidelines for improvements of future nanofluidic sieving structures.  Furthermore, they will generate useful insights for designs of synthetic nanofluidic structures for manipulation and measurement of (single) biomolecules, providing a novel basis for ultra-sensitive and high-resolution sensors and medical diagnostic systems.\n\nBroader Impact Outcome: Owing to its cross-disciplinary nature, our research has seamlessly integrated knowledge from separate fields to study dynamic properties of molecules in nanofluidic environments.  The combination of theoretical and experimental approaches to study molecular dynamics in confining nanofluidic environment will lead to improved nanofluidic sieving structure designs with enhanced separation efficiency.  The cross-disciplinary approach of our research will foster transformative progress for separation of physiologically-relevant biomolecules using synthetic nanofluidic structures, a critical step towards future highly integrated bioanalysis microsystems.  \n\n            In this research, we have conducted educational activities to target students from different educational levels and genders and ethnicities.

Through established educational programs at UM (including the UROP, SURE/SURE, and NNIN REU programs), we have recruited many undergrads to participate in our research.
