Maryland Launches Comprehensive Cybersecurity Talent Strategy to Drive Economic Growth and Secure the Future | TEDCO,"Thursday, April 3, 2025",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2025/maryland-launches-comprehensive-cybersecurity-talent-strategy-drive,,"Development & Marketing, Cyber Maryland Program","Thursday, April 3, 2025 Columbia New strategy will position Maryland as the nation’s cybersecurity capital COLUMBIA, Md., (April 3, 2025) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announces its Cyber Maryland Program has released the “Maryland’s Cybersecurity Talent Strategy” report (Cyber Maryland report). The report, created in collaboration with the Governor’s Workforce Development Board, follows a recent study conducted to better understand the current status of Maryland’s cybersecurity workforce pipeline. The study found more than 6,500 open public and private cybersecurity positions were available in Maryland and Washington D.C. between December 2023 and January 2024 this demand is expected to continue to grow by nearly 40% over the next 10 years. The Cyber Maryland report meets this growing demand with strategy, outlining a plan to prioritize economic growth, diversification and resilience through the Cyber Maryland program . This includes creating a more robust registry of registered apprenticeships, incorporating more cyber literacy into K-12 classes, and more. “We must take action now if we want to continue to lead,” said Portia Wu, Maryland’s Secretary of Labor . “We have thousands of high-paying jobs waiting for skilled workers. Our strategy connects the dots—leveraging our world-class institutions, cutting-edge private sector and proximity to federal cyber agencies to ensure that Maryland remains the epicenter of cybersecurity innovation.” Governor Wes Moore has identified three key industries as Maryland’s economic beacons: aerospace, technology and life sciences. Cybersecurity underpins all three, making Maryland’s leadership in this sector critical to securing jobs, innovation and national security. “Maryland is at a pivotal moment,” added Troy LeMaile-Stovall , CEO of TEDCO. “The talent is here, the resources are here and now we have the strategy to match. This is Maryland’s opportunity to double down on our strengths and secure our place as the nation’s cybersecurity capital.” “There’s no question that Maryland’s cybersecurity sector is one of the strongest foundations upon which we can build,” said Maryland Commerce Secretary Harry Coker, Jr. “From protecting small businesses from cyber threats to developing security protocols for federal agencies, our local talent pool is at the top of its game. Enhancing our cybersecurity strategy will critically support each of our industries and spur economic growth across the state.” Maryland Must Act to Stay Ahead The Washington, D.C./Maryland region has more open cybersecurity jobs than anywhere else in the country, but neighboring states are aggressively investing in workforce development to compete for cyber talent and industry growth. Cyber Maryland’s strategy ensures that the state remains a leader in this high-stakes race. ""As a leader in the tech and cyber industry, I see firsthand the urgent need for a strong, strategic approach to building our cybersecurity workforce,” said Delali Dzirasa, CEO of Fearless and vice-chair of the Governor's Workforce Development Board . “Maryland’s Cybersecurity Talent Strategy is a bold step toward ensuring we have the talent pipeline necessary to protect our critical infrastructure and drive innovation. This plan not only strengthens our cyber ecosystem but also creates real opportunities for individuals looking to enter and grow in this field. As Vice Chair of the Maryland Governor's Workforce Development Board, I am proud to support this talent strategy and the vital work we are doing to secure Maryland’s leadership in cybersecurity for years to come."" Maryland’s Unmatched Cybersecurity Ecosystem Maryland is uniquely positioned to lead the nation in cybersecurity. It is home to key federal cybersecurity agencies—including the National Security Agency (NSA), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and U.S. Cyber Command—alongside a thriving private-sector cyber ecosystem and world-class academic institutions. This unparalleled combination of assets, infrastructure and expertise makes Maryland the ideal location for businesses, government agencies and institutions looking to grow, innovate and protect the digital future. ""Maryland has always been at the forefront of cybersecurity,” said Roger Austin, chair of Cyber Maryland . ""But leadership is not a given—it’s a choice. With this strategy, we are choosing to lead."" For more information about the Maryland Cybersecurity Talent Strategy , please visit here .

As part of Maryland’s matching contribution toward the Baltimore Tech Hub , the BII seeks to advance technology toward commercialization of a product or service and bolster support for entrepreneurs developing technology-based ventures. “We are excited to unveil the BII program to the community, offering two grant opportunities to students and faculty at eligible higher education institutions throughout the Baltimore region,” said Abi Kulshreshtha , MII executive director. “The creation of this program exemplifies the impact MII has on Maryland and offers new opportunities for diverse perspectives and equitable funding opportunities that will lead to an inclusive merit-based ecosystem.” The launch of the new program introduces two grant opportunities aimed at fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. The Technology Advancement Grant offers applicants support to commercialize a new or existing technology at an eligible institution while the Entrepreneurship and Commercialization Programming and Infrastructure Grant supports the creation or enhancement of entrepreneurship programs and commercialization infrastructure for technology-based ventures. Both RFAs are due by 5:00pm on Thursday, May 8, 2025. “The collaborative nature of Baltimore communities has already led to incredible innovations and growth,” said Jalaycia Lewis , BII program manager. “I firmly believe that, through the BII program, we will see the creation of more opportunities for faculty and students, a feat that will lead to more innovative solutions to everyday problems.” The MII was established as a collaboration between the State of Maryland and five academic research institutions, and leverages each institution’s strengths while promoting the commercialization of research conducted there. Since its inception, the program has invested more than $59 million in promising research commercialization, supported nearly 200 companies and generated almost 400 jobs. The success of the MII led to several pilot programs that expanded MII’s reach to two more comprehensive universities in addition to the creation of BII. “Home to more than 50 accredited two- and four-year colleges and universities, Maryland has an abundance of brilliant faculty and researchers, including those at the world-renowned Johns Hopkins University,” said TEDCO CEO, Troy LeMaile-Stovall . “Baltimore is one of the most diverse cities and one of the top 100 best cities for young professionals nationwide, and data will tell us, diversity allows for different knowledge and perspectives to be shared collectively, leading to the growth of our innovation ecosystem. Entrepreneurs looking to make a difference must consider the worldwide impact of Maryland.” To learn more about the MII and BII programs, eligibility and application details, visit tedcomd.com/funding/maryland-innovation-initiative","Abi Kulshreshtha, Jalaycia Lewis, MII","BII, COLUMBIA, Johns Hopkins University, MII, MSA, The BII Pilot Program, The Technology Advancement Grant, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, the Baltimore Innovation Initiative, the Baltimore Tech Hub, the Maryland Innovation Initiative"

COLUMBIA, Md., (September 23, 2024) — TEDCO, Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced a recent $250,000 Builder Fund investment in CarrTech, a life sciences company working to support patients and healthcare providers. The Builder Fund is part of TEDCO’s Social Impact Funds , an umbrella of funds designed to support underserved founders and communities. “The purpose of CarrTech and our medical device FROG®, is saving lives by mitigating the risk of preparing ampoule-based medication,” said CarrTech’s founder and CEO Sue Carr. “My team and I are incredibly optimistic about the huge impact TEDCO’s investment could bring to the healthcare community.” CarrTech Corp., located in Frederick, Md. aims to reduce the significant risk associated with filtering medication packaged in glass ampoules. The extensive eight-step preparation process of filtering ampoule-based medication before administering to a patient, poses an increased risk of needlestick injuries to the healthcare providers. Additionally, if the medication is not filtered properly, glass shards entering a patient’s bloodstream can lead to fatal injuries. This risk is what led to the founding of CarrTech and their innovative medical device, FROG®, (Filter Removal of Glass) with this innovative device healthcare providers could see a reduction of needlestick injuries, more efficiency and better filtration. Jean-Luc Park, senior director of Social Impact Funds, explains “the FROG® device created by CarrTech Corp. can be a benefit to hospitals across the state and beyond. The goal behind helping fund life-science businesses such as these, here at TEDCO, is to support the companies creating new technologies.” CarrTech Corp previously received funding from TEDCO’s Seed Funds , Pre-Seed Rural Business Innovation Initiative Funds and RUBRIC program . In addition, the company has participated in several of the organization’s programs and resources including the Prelude Pitch , Network Advisors , SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab , DefTech and the Leading Women’s Program (now the Institute for Women Entrepreneur Excellence, Inc ). “An innovation like CarrTech’s is the embodiment of our work at TEDCO,” said TEDCO Social Impact Funds senior director, Jean-Luc Park . “We are looking forward to the developments at this company and through the greater Maryland entrepreneurial ecosystem.” For more information about TEDCO’s Social Impact Funds, visit https://www.tedcomd.com/funding/social-impact-funds .

The award will target the Mid-Atlantic region and provide total funding of nearly $10 million over three years. Furthermore, this award will allow TEDCO to collaborate with the Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) in Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), and other organizations across the region to continue empowering the Mid-Atlantic regional ecosystem with the creation of the Business Resource Information, Development, & Guidance Ecosystem (BRIDGE) program. “In passing the American Rescue Plan we committed not only to keeping our small businesses afloat amid the pandemic, but also to position them for long-term success. As our Investing in America agenda continues to generate new opportunities across our state, this $10 million investment in TEDCO’s BRIDGE Program will help connect our local entrepreneurs with these opportunities and boost the resources available for them to capitalize on this moment to innovate and compete,” said Senator Van Hollen, who as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee oversees funding for the Treasury Department and IRS. ""Turning an idea into a job-creator takes time, money, and support. By working together across the state and federal levels, we are helping entrepreneurs and small business owners access all three,"" said Maryland Governor Wes Moore. ""Maryland is grateful for the strong leadership of the Biden-Harris Administration, as we continue moving in partnership to make our state more competitive and leave no one behind.""

The BRIDGE program will aim to uplift Socially, Economically Disadvantaged Individuals (SEDI)- owned businesses and Very Small Businesses (VSBs), providing better access to capital and resources. To do this, the BRIDGE program will not only expand upon several existing programs while also creating new opportunities. The eight programs that will make up the BRIDGE program include: Financial Literacy, Credit Repair, and Building : to be led by the regional SBDCs, this program will provide consulting services in an effort to assist business owners in improving their credit, allowing them to better position themselves for loans and other debt capital. CDFI Technical Assistance: to be led by TEDCO, this competitive program will engage CDFI partners across the region by awarding 8 grants of up to $100K each year to support technical assistance programs managed by the CDFIs. Back-Office-In-a-Box: a new, competitive TEDCO program that will offer grants to organizations that can provide accounting, bookkeeping, human resources/payroll, and marketing software and support to others. Institute for Women Entrepreneur Excellence, Inc. : the TEDCO program will receive funding to expand the current program to allowing it to reach more SEDI women and women leading VSBs. Rural and Urban Business Innovation Initiative : the TEDCO programs will receive additional funding to support the program’s expansion, allowing for two more venture advisors to reach more Maryland-based startups and entrepreneurs.

Businesses receiving an investment from TEDCO’s Pre-Seed Builder Fund , housed under TEDCO’s Social Impact Funds , receive access to a variety of benefits designed to nurture business growth. “The promise of biologic drugs has been hampered by the need for frequent injections and cold-chain logistics,” said Derese Getnet, CEO of Simmbion. “Through the assistance of TEDCO, Simmbion is working to eliminate the need for recurrent needle-based administration of these drugs (and all the associated cold-chain). In success, our approach will transform adherence to treatment for diabetes, obesity, rare genetic diseases and cancer.” Nonadherence to therapy in chronic disease leads to poor outcomes and high cost. It is estimated that the rate of adherence to chronic medications is only in the range of 50%, which is responsible for half of all treatment failures and up to 25% of US hospitalizations each year. Because of this reality, Simmbion, LLC, located in Baltimore, Md., is working to develop a long-term cellular factory approach for the delivery biologics similar to insulin and GLP-1 to hopefully deliver safer treatments and reduce the cost and time of care. This synthetic cell technology possesses features such as being disease-agnostic, tunable and universally immune-compatible and requires only minimal cold-chain logistics. Currently, Simmbion plans to commercialize this in-vivo therapy expression system for companion animals like cats and dogs that depend on biologics, building a robust safety and efficacy product profile while advancing the rare orphan disease treatment for Gaucher’s in humans. “Simmbion’s innovative thinking could allow for continued advancement in the creation of synthetic cell technology and biologics,” said Jean-Luc Park , senior director of Social Impact Funds. “We look forward to seeing how their research and development support the continued growth of Maryland’s ecosystem and would like to extend the invitation to other technology start-ups from all industries to apply for TEDCO’s Funds.” TEDCO’s Social Impact Funds were created to support underrepresented entrepreneurs throughout Maryland.

Simmbion has engineered Trypanosomal symbionts to secrete specific therapeutic proteins. The company’s Simmbions™ are designed to be implanted within a patient via a single injection that provides sustained release of medication for up to one year or more. If necessary, Simmbions can be reversed with antimicrobials - offering unprecedented control over disease management. As a result, the sustained release of biologics and other therapeutic agents, drastically minimizes the need for conventional recurrent needle-based delivery methods and seamlessly integrates with many lifestyles and curtails the complexities of cold-chain logistics.

With the appointment of Abi as the MII executive director, we are confident that this initiative will continue driving innovation from the lab to the commercial market.” In addition to investments, MII provides grant opportunities, through two phases of awards: Technology Assessment and Company Formation. The Technology Assessment phase is outlined as a nine-month project that focuses on technology validation and market assessment, while the Company Formation phase supports the commercial launch of technologies. This structure is designed to support the full commercialization journey, from lab to market. These two phases recently underwent changes to enhance the current support MII offers. Since inception, MII has expanded its reach to include two additional comprehensive universities, Frostburg State University and Bowie State University, as part of the MII Pilot Programs. This initiative aims to foster innovation and bring more research to the market.

This collaborative program has supported more than 170 startup companies, created 370 jobs and procured more than $737 million in follow-on funding since its inception nearly 12 years ago. Recently, the program expanded to include opportunities at two comprehensive universities – Frostburg State University and Bowie State University.

TEDCO Invests in Kubanda Cryotherapy | TEDCO,"Tuesday, June 11, 2024",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2024/tedco-invests-kubanda-cryotherapy,Kubanda Cryotherapy,Social Impact Funds,"Tuesday, June 11, 2024 Columbia Biotechnology company innovates treatment for pets with lumps, bumps and cancer COLUMBIA, Md., (June 11, 2024) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced a recent $200,000 Pre-Seed Builder Fund investment in Kubanda Cryotherapy. The Pre-Seed Builder Fund is housed under TEDCO’s Social Impact Funds , which were created to engage and invest in economically underserved founders and communities. “Most pet tumors go untreated, and existing treatment options are inaccessible due to high costs and slow healing times,” said Bailey Surtees, CEO of Kubanda Cryotherapy. “We saw this gap in care and built an alternative, non-surgical solution, which offers less down time and better healing outcomes for pets. With TEDCO’s support, we can continue our mission of breaking down barriers to high-quality care.” Kubanda Cryotherapy , located in Baltimore, Md., has developed a minimally invasive treatment for lumps, bumps and tumors in pets. Using cryoablation technology, their innovation works to kill cells through the formation of intracellular ice crystals. This procedure could offer faster healing time than surgery, chemo, or radiation procedures, and costs a fraction of the price for pet parents, broadening access to care. “Kubanda Cryotherapy’s innovation offers a solution that can be used by many veterinarians,” said Jean-Luc Park , senior director of TEDCO’s Social Impact Funds . “Such a promising technology is starting in the veterinary clinic and could explore other healthcare sectors.” Kubanda Cryotherapy has utilized several of TEDCO’s resources, including the Maryland Innovation Initiative ( MII ), where they received a Company Formation award, and the SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab . Builder Fund companies receive access to resources such as hands-on executive support, peer-to-peer mentoring and collaboration, and networking opportunities.

New TEDCO Study Outlines Steps for Developing Maryland’s Cybersecurity Workforce | TEDCO,"Wednesday, May 29, 2024",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2024/new-tedco-study-outlines-steps-developing-marylands-cybersecurity,,Cyber Maryland Program,"Wednesday, May 29, 2024 Columbia Findings include a misalignment of cybersecurity workforce supply and demand COLUMBIA, Md., (May 29, 2024) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, unveiled the recently completed “Cybersecurity Workforce Analysis and Strategy” (“Study”). The Study was commissioned by TEDCO to better understand the current status of Maryland’s cybersecurity workforce pipeline. This knowledge will be used to guide the Cyber Maryland Program (“Program”) and its 18-member board of directors as they develop a statewide cybersecurity workforce development strategic plan. “The Study confirms what businesses and government agencies in Maryland already know: demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals—who protect our communities from criminals threatening our way of life—is incredibly nuanced. Thankfully, there is support and momentum amongst key stakeholders to bridge our talent gap,” said Roger Austin, chair of the Cyber Maryland board of directors . “My fellow board members and I are committed to address this critical need by developing innovative solutions to overcome our cyber skills talent gaps and provide good, paying jobs for our state’s residents.” The Study, performed by Lightcast , found that the epicenter for cybersecurity talent can be found in the National Capital Region, a region that consists of Maryland, the District of Columbia and Virginia. This region hosts the largest and most concentrated cybersecurity workforce nationwide a large portion of this is contributed to the region being home to several federal government agencies. This prime location has also given rise to a large ecosystem of defense contractors, cybersecurity firms and technology companies, the Study notes. However, despite this being an epicenter for talent, there are some issues. In particular, the Study notes that the development of talent is lagging behind the intense demand for cybersecurity workers. This lag places Maryland and the District of Columbia region seventh nationwide in the number of cyber-aligned graduates at the sub-bachelor’s degree level and tenth in bachelor’s degree completions. While this may not seem to be detrimental, it is resulting in a region-wide talent gap. While talent gaps for cyber-aligned fields are felt in most states, the National Capital Region is feeling them the most. With the largest cybersecurity talent gap in the nation and more than 6,500 openings between December 2023 – January 2024 in Maryland and the District of Columbia alone, the Study found that only 33% of the cybersecurity workforce demand is being met by the current workforce. These positions are not only unfilled, but they’re unable to be filled with the current supply of talent in the region. “As cybersecurity continues to grow as an essential part of every industry, the need for a strong and resilient workforce pipeline has become increasingly important,” said Alex Choi , executive director, government program development, affairs & research, TEDCO. “Together, with the Cyber Maryland board and ecosystem stakeholders, we look forward to ensuring that we are not only meeting the Cybersecurity workforce needs of today, but also building a nimble workforce pipeline infrastructure that can adapt to the needs of the future.” In the coming months, the Program will convene a series of work sessions to strategize and build on the recommendations provided in the Study. The workgroups will delve deeper in topics including, expanding apprenticeships, internships and other work-learning opportunities, recommendations on skills-based hiring practices, evolving cybersecurity education and training and creating a wholistic, statewide approach to Maryland’s cyber workforce industry data. These recommendations, along with the findings of the Study, will be compiled into a strategic plan which will be operationalized to establish a nimble and sustainable workforce pipeline infrastructure. The Program, established through legislation in 2023 , seeks to address challenges in the state’s cybersecurity workforce development ecosystem by impacting current and future demand through the development of a workforce pipeline infrastructure. The Program serves as a ‘hub’ for cybersecurity related workforce development in the state, facilitating greater communication and fostering deeper relationships between employers, training/educational providers and the workforce. Through stakeholder engagement, industry data analysis, grantmaking and other initiatives, the Program helps identify and address current and emerging training and workforce needs in the ecosystem.

TEDCO Talks: TEDCO and BDC CEOs Expand on Baltimore Developments | TEDCO,"Thursday, April 25, 2024",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2024/tedco-talks-tedco-and-bdc-ceos-expand-baltimore-developments,,,"Thursday, April 25, 2024 Columbia Troy LeMaile-Stovall and Colin Tarbert discuss Baltimore’s ecosystem COLUMBIA, Md., (April 25, 2024) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, released another episode of TEDCO Talks. This insightful series allows TEDCO CEO, Troy LeMaile-Stovall , to connect with thought leaders throughout the state of Maryland and beyond, discussing different topics regarding economic development. On this episode , LeMaile-Stovall welcomed Colin Tarbert, CEO and president of the Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC), an organization working to enable economic growth in a manner that is inclusive to all residents. A Ripple Effect The conversation began by recognizing the recent tragedy – the collapse of the Francis Scott Key (FSK) Bridge. The closure of any port is bound to impact the economy and local businesses, but with the Port of Baltimore – an entity that directly employs almost 10% of the jobs in the city and is one of the busiest ports on the east coast – the impact is bound to ripple throughout the state, across the nation and into other countries. On top of being the number one importer of roll-on, roll-off vessels (cars, tractors, etc.), LeMaile-Stovall cites that the Baltimore port is one of the biggest exporters of coal to India this coal is then used to make bricks that are sent back to the Baltimore port and used in various building projects. According to Tarbert, there is a misconception circling that cargo ships are arriving to ports faster than they would arrive to the Port of Baltimore and therefore distribution is faster. While this is partially correct – Baltimore is farther west than either of these ports, therefore making the ships’ trip a bit longer – the other ports are father away from distributers and customers. And since cargo ships tend to travel faster than vehicles on land, this additional distance after arriving at the port is leading to longer customer wait times and more expenses for companies. Looking Ahead The collapse of the FSK Bridge will affect the surrounding economy and will require adjustments to be made as construction continues. However, the BDC’s goals remain the same – to redevelop and support Baltimore’s job growth and investment. “That’s our primary mission – to see investment across the city, not just in downtown, but in neighborhoods. And we want to make sure that the economic growth that happens in Baltimore city is something that benefits all Baltimoreans,” Tarbert explained. “Baltimore is a Black-majority city… I still want Baltimore to be a Black-majority city, but one that has neighborhoods that are all doing well and are invested in. I don’t want to change the culture of Baltimore, even though I want to improve life and economic development for the city.” BDC and Upsurge, two organizations in Baltimore centered on promoting economic development, are striving to do just that. LeMaile-Stovall ends the episode with admiration, recognizing the deliberate planning both organizations are doing to consider how to “have this growth and do it without displacing anyone.” Learn more about Tarbert, plans for Baltimore’s growth, and more by listening to the whole conversation here and subscribe to TEDCO’s YouTube channel to be notified each time a new TEDCO Talks episode is released.","Baltimore, Colin Tarbert, LeMaile-Stovall","BDC, Baltimore’s, COLUMBIA, FSK, LeMaile-Stovall, TEDCO’s YouTube, Tarbert, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, the Baltimore Development Corporation, the FSK Bridge, the Francis Scott Key"

The direct spending request was sponsored by U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and included in the Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Services and General Government funding bill, which was signed into law last month as part of a FY24 appropriations package. “Maryland is home to more than 70 federal labs, from the NIH in Bethesda to the Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research and the Army Medical Research and Development Command,” said Senator Cardin. “With this federal investment, we’re making it easier for traditionally underserved businesses in the healthcare industry to take full advantage of the resources right in their backyard. Community partnerships like the FLLIP Program drive innovation in the state and help build a more equitable, prepared and developed health care system.” The FLLIP Pilot Program will be a collaborative effort between TEDCO and the Frederick Innovation Technology Center, Inc. (FITCI) to address the challenge of helping entrepreneurs and small businesses approach and navigate federal laboratories to allow for collaborations that will enable entrepreneurs to develop innovative solutions for healthcare challenges and grow their businesses. “To strengthen Maryland’s small businesses, we must remove barriers and help entrepreneurs access the resources and support they need to succeed. That’s why we fought to deliver this $1,150,000 direct federal investment in TEDCO’s FLLIP Pilot Program – to unlock new innovation opportunities for emerging businesses to access the expertise of Maryland-based federal labs as they work to uncover lifesaving discoveries,” said Senator Van Hollen, the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services & General Government. TEDCO continues to be an influential entity in Maryland, generating $2.7 billion in economic activity across the state, supporting more than 12,000 jobs, and more. A portion of this economic activity can be attributed to the federal programs already in place. These programs, like the SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab and DefTech , show TEDCO’s expertise in preparing, promoting and growing such a program like FLLIP. “This new program fits perfectly within TEDCO’s scope,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall , TEDCO CEO. “At TEDCO, we are already collaborating with federal labs, and, with this new program and earmarked funding, we are looking forward to expanding our support to more businesses and entrepreneurial efforts. We greatly appreciate the continual support from both Senator Cardin and Senator Van Hollen as we work to grow and support Maryland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem.” FITCI is also well-positioned for these efforts. The organization is located in one of Maryland’s Biotech Hubs, surrounded by several key Federal labs including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Frederick National Lab. This strategic location has led the program to success, with contributions of more than $84 million to the local economy and will be an asset for the FLLIP Pilot Program. ""The FLLIP Pilot Program demonstrates TEDCO's ongoing commitment to nurturing early-stage companies by facilitating access to federal laboratories within our State,” said Kim Mozingo , TEDCO’s director of federal programs. “Through FLLIP, we're poised to catalyze economic growth by transitioning groundbreaking technologies and expertise from the federal to the private sector, addressing both governmental and commercial needs.""","Ben Cardin, Biotech Hubs, Cardin, Chris Van Hollen, DefTech, Kim Mozingo, Van Hollen","COLUMBIA, Congressionally Directed Spending, FITCI, FLLIP, Federal Lab Leveraging Innovation to Products (FLLIP) Pilot Program, Financial Services, General Government, NIH, State, TEDCO’s FLLIP Pilot Program, The FLLIP Pilot Program, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services & General Government, the Army Medical Research and Development Command, the FLLIP Pilot Program, the Frederick Innovation Technology Center, Inc., the Frederick National Lab, the Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research, the National Institutes of Health"

The information collected is then transferred to an online portal that allows for real time data access. “Minnowtech’s device has the potential to be a game changer in the shrimp farming industry,” said Teddy Gresser , director of TEDCO’s Seed Funds. “The collected data may allow farmers to gain a better understanding of their shrimp population, allowing for easier disease detection and hopefully prevent under or over feeding.” TEDCO’s Seed Funds , a family of funds focused on investing in early-stage technology companies that show promise of becoming venture fundable companies or are companies that, through a seed investment, will be sustainable through customer revenue, follow-on funding or other forms of corporate venture.

In 2023, it is about 52% people of color… so things have changed dramatically, but they’ve also changed for the good… we want to make sure these industries can grow so we can also take the diversity of the county and the opportunity to help new industries and people… to make sure there is also the opportunity for those who are coming in and just starting out to be just as successful as those who have been here for a long time.” Diving a bit more into MCEDC, Tompkins explains that the company focuses on creating and growing jobs.

TEDCO’s Social Impact Funds invests in and provides executive support to Maryland-based technology companies run by entrepreneurs who demonstrate economic disadvantage. “HR spends so much of its time on compliance, which poses a complicated legal landscape for HR to manage, since federal, state, and local employment and labor laws change all the time. We’ve developed a solution that simplifies that otherwise complex process by offering a chatbot that provides legal guidance to HR on a variety of tasks – all programmed by experienced labor and employment attorneys,” said Jocelyn King, CEO of VirgilHR. “Thanks to TEDCO’s additional investment, we can continue to work to empower companies and HR professionals. By investing in our software, TEDCO is helping HR professionals save hours of time spent researching regulations to ensure they remain compliant, all the while controlling legal costs and mitigating risk.” VirgilHR , based in Gaithersburg, Md., offers a software as a service (SaaS) solution that supports human resources (HR) professionals. Through the interactive software, HR specialists can access employment and labor law information without additional research. This solution not only allows for employers to keep better track of the ever-changing federal, state and local employment and labor laws, but provides tailored legal guidance to support a more efficient compliance process. “VirgilHR is an example of the innovative technology startups the Builder Fund was made to invest in,” said TEDCO’s senior director of Social Impact Funds, Jean-Luc Park . “With their software as a service solution, HR employees will have the required information about new and changing regulations, allowing the employees to continue supporting their companies without the research headache that can happen without a continually updated archive. VirgilHR’s system determines and provides the relevant information to keep the company compliant with all the local, state, and federal laws. The technology is much more than a simple database.” VirgilHR previously received funding from TEDCO’s Pre-Seed Builder Fund in 2022. Housed under the Social Impact Funds umbrella, the Pre-Seed Builder Fund invests in companies with the goal of helping startups reach meaningful milestones and become healthy companies, going on to either attract larger institutional investors or become independent of the venture investor path. Funded companies are also provided resources like hands-on executive support, peer-to-peer mentorship/collaboration and networking opportunities.

Sisu Global Health , based in Baltimore, Md., has created an autotransfusion device, Hemafuse the device provides surgical patients access to fresh, whole blood by capturing it from internal bleeding and giving it back to them immediately in the same surgery. The patented Hemafuse System can operate anywhere there is a surgeon (regardless of infrastructure), making it well suited for military and emerging markets, with applications in the U.S., Sisu Global is bringing Hemafuse to the global market after clinical success in Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and Ukraine. The company has received previous TEDCO funding, including through the Rural and Underserved Business Recovery from Impact of COVID-19 ( RUBRIC ) program. “Our Hemafuse device can be used in numerous situations where access to donor blood is lacking,” said Gillian Henker, president and co-founder of Sisu Global Health. “Surgeons can use it in the operating room. Military doctors can use it on the battlefield in areas with limited infrastructure, including for the current situation in Ukraine. Even veterinarians can use it when animal donor blood isn’t available. Further, you don’t have to worry about having an exact match because you’re recycling your own blood.” In addition to the Hemafuse device, Sisu is also developing the (r)Evolve, a cost-effective, manual centrifugation device that can centrifuge whole blood and separate it into plasma and serum in any setting, with or without electricity. “Sisu has developed innovative solutions to address global issues,” said Jean-Luc Park , senior director of TEDCO’s Social Impact Funds. “We’re looking forward to seeing the company’s journey, especially as they prepare to bring their Hemafuse device to the global market.” The Inclusion Fund program is part of TEDCO’s Social Impact Funds , which were established to support economically underserved founders and communities.

The company previously received investment from TEDCO’s Seed Fund and the Rural and Underserved Business Recovery from Impact of COVID-19 ( RUBRIC ) program. “With hemorrhages, time is of the essence.

Regional Cyber Operations Center Feasibility Study (Frostburg State University) MII Investment: $150,000 A Regional Cyber Security Operations Center (RSOC) is an entity that provides continuous operational IT security by monitoring, assessing, preventing, and responding to threats to protected IT systems. FSU in partnership with Deloitte, seeks to study the feasibility of establishing a RSOC for Western Maryland, which will serve to protect the region’s businesses, non-profit organizations, and local government entities from the threat of cyber breaches. The study will explore the resources needed for the launch and the potential educational workforce and economic impact of an RSOC which will strengthen the role of FSU as an anchor institution for the region. Results will be used to further develop a pilot program for Western Maryland that could be replicated in other parts of the State. “It’s an honor to be able to help university-based entrepreneurs, particularly students, find their footing and thrive,” said Renée Winsky , MII Board Chair. “These three investments represent a major milestone for the MII and TEDCO as we expand our efforts to fuel innovation across all of Maryland, fostering company formation and growth that will also bear future job opportunities for our communities.” For more information about the MII please visit https://www.tedcomd.com/funding/maryland-innovation-initiative .

"Linshom Medical, Inc. Closes $650K in Series A Round with Investments from Abell Foundation and TEDCO | TEDCO","Monday, August 21, 2023",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2023/linshom-medical-inc-closes-650k-series-round-investments-abell,"Linshom Medical, Inc.","Venture Funds, Development & Marketing","Monday, August 21, 2023 Columbia COLUMBIA, Md., (August 21, 2023) - TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced their portfolio company, Linshom Medical , a Maryland startup medical device company producing innovative advances in respiratory monitoring, received investments of $250K and $400K from Abell Foundation and TEDCO respectively as part of a Series A preferred equity round. Accurate respiratory monitoring and rapid detection of early respiratory decline are foundational to ensuring positive patient outcomes. Linshom is first to deliver operating room (OR) quality respiratory data to the patient’s bedside. Patients on the general care floor, in the emergency room, in the post anesthesia care unit, and at home do not have the quality of monitoring available in the OR or intensive care unit (ICU). Those technologies are too big, complex and expensive for bedside use. Linshom addresses these barriers by delivering a small, low cost, wearable sensor that delivers highly accurate, continuous, predictive respiratory monitoring (CPRM) to the patient’s bedside. “Linshom has proven their ability to hit key performance milestones by achieving FDA clearance, securing a $2.4M National Institute of Health grant and conducting a post-approval, in-hospital, clinical study with its partner, Ohio State University, on time and on budget. We are impressed by Linshom’s effective execution of its commercial strategy in a $2 billon market, and we are proud to support their business relocation to Baltimore City,” said Eileen O’Rourke, director of impact investments for the Abell Foundation. “Linshom is the type of technology and life science startup in Maryland that we like to see. Linshom's innovation can save lives by alerting medical professionals as soon as breathing issues arise,” said Katherine Hill Ritchie , TEDCO’s senior director, Venture Funds . “The Linshom team has knowledge and experience in developing and commercializing medical technologies. We look forward to seeing this company scale.” “Patient respiratory depression events are fairly common and can lead to costly rapid response activation, rescue events and ICU transfers. Linshom can intercept these disasters by calling early attention to respiratory decline so that clinical staff can take action,” said Richard Hughen, chief executive officer of Linshom. “I am delighted to have the Abell Foundation and TEDCO join as investor-partners. These investments further validate the value of Linshom Medical’s technology and our CPRM device.” About Linshom Medical, Inc. Linshom (“to breathe”) Medical is first to deliver an operating room quality respiratory profile to the patient bedside (or home) for continuous, predictive respiratory monitoring (CPRM). Our patented and FDA cleared device provides a predictive (vs. responsive) respiratory profile including Respiratory Rate (RR), relative Tidal Volume (rTV) and Seconds Since Last Breath (SSLB) that are all delivered continuously and in real time. Our mission is to eliminate the morbidity, mortality and cost due to unrecognized respiratory compromise in healthcare. For more information, visit www.LinshomForLife.com.

Throughout this insightful virtual series, TEDCO CEO, Troy LeMaile-Stoval l, connects with thought-leaders throughout the state to discuss different topics regarding Maryland’s economic development. On this latest episode, LeMaile-Stovall speaks with Eddie Resende, CEO of the World Trade Center Institute ( WTCI ). The fireside discussion touches on various topics, including the origins behind the WTCI, a new program that will bring the global market to Maryland, and how the organization supports the next generation of diplomats. “One of the things that we did a few years ago is launch through the WTCI two fellowships, one that’s catered to high school students,” Resende explains. The Albrecht Fellowship was created to support high school students interested in diplomacy. Through this fellowship, the students can jump start their careers and learn more about diplomacy. Additionally, Resende explains there is another program he’s proud of and helped create. This program is a “global pathway for students,” exploring the question of how to attract and retain global talent locally. Resende explains that WTCI saw many graduates leave Maryland after completing their studies. Upon further investigation, it was revealed that, more often than not, graduates felt like they had to leave the state to forge a diplomatic career, resulting in a large loss of talent. Knowing this needed to change, Resende explains that this program is a two-week intensive program that takes college students to major global companies. Resende explains that, of the students who completed the program “about 70% are now employed in Maryland.” Learn more about WTCI, their impact on Maryland’s economic development, and more by listening to the full episode by clicking here.

This investment came through TEDCO’s Venture Funds. “Blood is highly perishable, type-specific and blood shortages are common, so most emergency responders do not carry blood, delaying trauma patients access to this life-saving therapy” said Elaine Haynes, president and CEO of KaloCyte. “Thanks to the latest investment from TEDCO, KaloCyte can continue to research, develop, and advance ErythroMer towards clinical trials. With this innovative artificial red blood cell, we hope to save lives both on and off the battlefield.” TEDCO’s investment was matched by Vitalant , one of the nation’s largest nonprofit blood and biotherapies healthcare organizations.

ErythroMer is a dried, bio-inspired artificial RBC that mimics the complex physiology of natural RBCs. Dried for long-term storage without refrigeration, the innovative product can be carried on ambulances, in medic backpacks, and stockpiled for mass casualties – just add sterile water to save lives and transform current treatment practices for patients needing emergency transfusions. “TEDCO is dedicated to investing in small businesses in the technology and life science industries throughout Maryland,” said Katherine Hill Ritchie , senior director, Venture Funds at TEDCO. “KaloCyte is a fitting example of the cutting-edge life science companies that we like to see.

The discussion continued, delving deeper into what connects TEDCO with MEDCO, the Cultivate Maryland initiative, and how MEDCO supports the competitive nature of Maryland’s ecosystem. “We have these tremendous knowledge-and-innovation based assets, and they need to be leveraged… The more that we’re bringing an industry to collaborate with our research institutions, the more job creation can be facilitated in those communities… One of Maryland’s greatest strengths has been its knowledge-based economy,” explained Sadowski. “We’re trying to work with you in this Equitech effort—this Cultivate effort—to be the glue, to bring together our current stakeholders so that, not only are we doing this tremendous amount of research… but we’re bringing in industry in such a way that technology can be commercialized much more quickly and it leads to manufacturing opportunities and value added economic development... the more we can bring the private sector in to be part of the solution, and work together, the better. I think we can make for a more efficient, effective and equitable economic outcome…” “And a word I’ll add to that is sustainable, because if we have that partnership with the private sector… the government shouldn’t be picking what should be done, if we let the markets pick what should be done and the folks who do it day-to-day pick which sectors we should be investing in,” LeMaile-Stovall added.

(May 1, 2023) – TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced a $200,000 investment of State Small Business Credit Initiative ( SSBCI ) funding into Novel Microdevices, a company that seeks to provide lab-level accuracy results for diagnostic testing, allowing for faster and more informed patient care. “In medicine, timely test results are essential,” Andrea Pais, Novel Microdevices’ CEO and co-founder. “That’s why we’re focusing on eliminating as much of the wait as possible, and our Novel Dx system does just that.” Novel Microdevices , based in Baltimore, Md., is a woman-owned medical device company, working to revolutionize clinical diagnostics. Through this effort, the company has developed the Novel Dx device, a cost-effective, portable, rapid, and easy-to-use testing solution. The company is challenging the point-of-care antigen and molecular testing market by providing lab-level PCR test results in under 15 minutes, at the same price point as the rapid antigen test. The Novel Dx platform is a self-contained, point-of-care device with a disposable cartridge that can extract and purify nucleic acids from multiple sample types (urine, blood, saliva and swabs) and pathogens (bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa). Upon insertion of the cartridge into the Novel Microdevices instrument, the sample undergoes the entire automated process of lysis, sample extraction, purification, concentration and DNA amplification through proprietary ultra-fast PCR thermocycling and real-time fluorescence detection. By using the Novel Dx device, physicians can test for pathogens and receive lab-equivalent results in under 15 minutes, allowing patients to receive same-day treatment. Test cartridges currently in development are for multiplex assays for respiratory diseases and sexually transmitted diseases, and in the longer term, the test menu may be expanded to multiple sample types and pathogens to cover a broad range of infectious disease assays that could all run on the Novel Dx platform. “TEDCO values the innovative entrepreneurs that are working to make the world a better place, entrepreneurs like Andrea,” said Jean-Luc Park , senior director of TEDCO’s Social Impact Funds . “Through the Novel Dx, patients can rest at ease with faster test results, which could lead to faster diagnoses and towards a faster recovery. I’m excited to see where Novel Microdevices’ journey takes them next.” The SSBCI funding invested in Novel Microdevices is provided through the Social Impact Funds, a fund that seeks to support traditionally underrepresented entrepreneurs and small businesses.

He was absolutely brilliant… ahead of his time. But what I noticed was he struggled, big time, to get access to capital and bonding, which is why I’m doing what I’m doing right now.” As the discussion continued, the two dove deeper into the different opportunities MMG offers to Maryland entrepreneurs, including the State Small Business Credit Initiative ( SSBCI ) and how TEDCO and MMG work together to transform the state’s economy with this unique funding.

Many of the marinas throughout the boating industry were still relying on paper, spreadsheets, and whiteboards for their business’ management,” explained Jennifer LeRoux, CEO of Marinalife. “Turns out, the technology software created to simplify managing marinas is costly and limiting, causing many marina owners to resort to other, non-technology-based solutions. So, we sought to provide solutions that would benefit everyone—limiting the frustrations boaters experience, while also providing a more reliable and efficient method of management for marinas. It was time to bring technology to the boating industry, streamlining various processes, letting boaters and marina management find the information they need to succeed.” Marinalife Inc. , based in Baltimore, Md., is bringing tech-enabled solutions to the boating industry. Through Marinalife’s platforms, marinas and boaters are provided with an easier way to connect and interact. One of these platforms is Snag-A-Slip, which allows boaters to easily search, select and reserve a slip. Additionally, Marinalife Manager offers marina owners a better management experience, providing streamlined internal operations and real-time analytics. Marinalife’s suite of products allows marinas to spend more time interacting with boaters and ensuring they are available to provide excellent customer service and support. “It’s hard to believe that in the 21st century, a significant business like the boating industry was still relying on paper and ink,” said Katherine Hill Ritchie , senior director of Venture Funds at TEDCO. “The innovative technology solutions that Marinalife offers have the potential to impact the entire boating industry, allowing for happier boaters and marina managers. It’s this innovative thinking that allows TEDCO to create change throughout Maryland.” TEDCO’s evergreen Venture Funds are committed to funding and growing the next generation of early-stage businesses in Maryland these funds are one of the many investment opportunities TEDCO can provide to qualifying technology-based start-ups and small businesses throughout Maryland.

On the latest TEDCO Talks, LeMaile-Stovall interviews Brian Pieninck , CEO of CareFirst , at the 2023 CIAA Men’s and Women’s Basketball Tournament in Baltimore, Md. During the discussion, Pieninck and LeMaile-Stovall dive into the vast resources Maryland has to offer, what needs to be done to successfully utilize these resources, and, ultimately, Cultivate Maryland , a new initiative TEDCO is spearheading to create a more diverse and inclusive innovation ecosystem throughout the State. Throughout the episode, Pieninck explains that large businesses have an economic responsibility. Rather than considering how to attract large businesses to an area, companies, cities and states should focus more on the areas’ economic foundation—successful entrepreneurism and small businesses “if you do interesting and effective things … people will find you. And the interesting and effective things we can do in a space starts with entrepreneurism and small businesses. If we grow and develop that foundation effectively—if we show that this is a place where small businesses can thrive—[it will become] a place, an ecosystem and an environment that large organizations complementary to those efforts want to be in.” Hence the Cultivate Maryland initiative. Through this initiative, TEDCO is building an inclusive environment for technology and start-up businesses by creating more opportunities for a larger and more diverse workforce through the support and increased creation of opportunities for underrepresented individuals to get involved in high technology-based education, careers and entrepreneurial activities. “Cultivate Maryland is an initiative that not only promotes groundbreaking changes to the state’s ecosystem, but it’s an initiative we at TEDCO are proud to be a part of,” said LeMaile-Stovall. “And we couldn’t have gotten this far without the support of many individuals, including Brian. It’s time for us to embrace the future, grow our ecosystem, and become a leader in economic growth and competitiveness nationwide.” Click here to watch the full episode and to learn more about CareFirst, Cultivate Maryland and the importance of embracing change throughout the Maryland ecosystem.

Throughout this series, TEDCO CEO, Troy LeMaile-Stovall , connects with thought leaders across the state of Maryland. On the latest TEDCO Talks, LeMaile-Stovall interviews Carim Khouzami , president and CEO of Baltimore Gas and Electric ( BGE ). During the discussion, Khouzami and LeMaile-Stovall dive into BGE’s role in the community, the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion and how it impacts the innovation ecosystem in Maryland. “The very basis of innovation is to think about doing things differently and better,” Khouzami explains. “And the way that you get that is you have to have that diversity of thought, you have to have that diversity of people, that diversity of backgrounds, to bring different ways of looking at a similar problem … so you can come to the best solution.” This mindset is essential for the State’s economic growth, LeMaile-Stovall and Khouzami note. By embracing diversity of thought, individuals and backgrounds, companies allow the contribution of different perspectives. And with different perspectives comes different solutions and ideas, providing the avenue for the necessary innovation that will support Maryland’s growth and movement into the future. It allows for the development of new solutions for rising issues, such as the capacity of the electric grid—a problem that will only become more prevalent as we move into a future of more environmentally conscious options with less carbon emissions. TEDCO is proud to be embracing this mindset we are actively working to bring more diversity to Maryland’s ecosystem through funding efforts and initiatives like Cultivate Maryland this initiative seeks to increase Maryland’s competitiveness as an innovation economy through the retention and attraction of trained workers. This recently unveiled initiative is already gaining vast amounts of support. “It’s refreshing to see how many companies—both large and small—are getting on board and embracing DEI,” explains LeMaile-Stovall. “And we want to give a huge thank you to Khouzami and BGE for being a huge supporter to both TEDCO and the Cultivate Maryland initiative.

Throughout this series, TEDCO CEO, Troy LeMaile-Stovall , connects with various thought leaders in economic development from across the state of Maryland. On this edition of TEDCO Talks, LeMaile-Stovall spends time talking with President Sosulski about innovation, the education sector, and the college’s plans to improve diversity, equity and inclusion throughout the campus. Innovation is prevalent throughout the campus, Sosulski and LeMaile-Stovall explain. Due to their location and the land the college has been gifted, students have the opportunity to explore innovative ideas to support conservation efforts, like the college’s current exploration into bird safe glass. In addition to the campus’ innovative spirit, there are continued efforts to create a more diverse, inclusive and equitable educational environment throughout Washington College. While there had been work done throughout the campus towards creating a more inclusive and diverse environment, the efforts were not coordinated. Because of this, Sosulski appointed the college’s first senior equity officer. “I realized, let’s take all that good energy, let’s give it some strong leadership and really see what we can do in terms of making our learning environment as diverse as possible and making it accessible to all people and also, bringing people to campus who traditionally have not been able to enjoy this type of education in the past,” Sosulski explained. “…It has to become a daily practice it has to be our way of being.” Learn more about Washington College, their DEI efforts, current impact on the Maryland innovation ecosystem and the preservation of Maryland wildlife in the latest episode of TEDCO Talks.

Piloted in 2018 with the Department of Defense—and in partnership with the Harford County Office of Community & Economic Development and U.S. Army labs at Aberdeen Proving Ground—DefTech focused on creating opportunities for businesses to partner with labs. In 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration provided three additional years of funding to expand the program. Building on the existing framework and incorporating a sustainable business model, the new partnership between TEDCO and Commerce, funded by The DoD’s office of Local Defense Community Cooperation, will expand the program to DoD labs across the state and provide to support for businesses in rural communities. “We look forward to partnering with Maryland Commerce on this strategic DefTech Center project,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall , TEDCO CEO “By applying TEDCO’s knowledge and resources to expand DefTech, we will enhance the development of a sustainable business model allowing the program to grow and diversify, while simultaneously supporting DefTech’s clients and overall growth.” Led by Maryland Commerce for nearly four years, DefTech successfully created or retained 632 Maryland jobs and raised $33 million of investment funds. The current DefTech expansion builds on the program’s previous success and is supported by grant funds from the DoD’s Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation (OLDCC) and through support from Maryland Commerce and TEDCO. With this new partnership, TEDCO’s mentorship programs, guidance and connections to resources will offer long-term support to DefTech’s clients. TEDCO’s Federal Programs will provide oversight, administration and service delivery support to create new opportunities for businesses in Maryland to engage with federal labs. This new engagement will strengthen and diversify the defense supply chain, generating new revenue opportunities for both DoD and commercial markets. “We are excited to expand our relationship with Maryland’s DoD labs,” explains Kim Mozingo , TEDCO’s director of Federal Programs and the principal investigator for this program. “With the support of both TEDCO and Maryland Commerce, DefTech has the potential to provide unmatched support to clients throughout the State, growing the economy and providing more innovation than ever before.” The expanded DefTech program is expected to launch in February 2023.

"New TEDCO Study Outlines Critical Steps Needed to Cultivate a Thriving, Inclusive and Growing Innovation Economy | TEDCO","Monday, January 23, 2023",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2023/new-tedco-study-outlines-critical-steps-needed-cultivate-thriving,,Equitech Growth Fund ,"Monday, January 23, 2023 Columbia Recommendations include funding an Equitech Growth Fund and the establishment of an innovation-focused commission COLUMBIA, Md. (January 23, 2023) – TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, unveiled a legislatively mandated Maryland Innovation Competitiveness Study—one that could lead to a 5-year, $250 million down payment for an Equitech Growth Fund and the establishment of a major Kirwan-type commission. The new commission would map out an in-depth strategic plan focused on ensuring Maryland becomes a national model for a thriving, inclusive tech sector and innovation economy. “On behalf of TEDCO, we thank the General Assembly for their directive and RTI International and Keen Point Consulting for their work on this illuminating report. The findings are clear: our state can lead the U.S. in tech innovation and growth in a way that is inclusive of talented but traditionally underrepresented Marylanders,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall , TEDCO CEO. “Now is the time for Maryland to take the crucial next steps to ensure our place as a top innovation leader, beginning with the creation of an Equitech Growth Fund and a major new commission that is laser-focused on growing a thriving, diverse tech sector.” The Maryland legislature’s 2022 Joint Chairmen’s Report (JCR) directed TEDCO to oversee a study that would guide the creation of a $500 million, 10-year Equitech Growth Fund. TEDCO brought on RTI International and Keen Point Consulting to draft the Maryland Innovation Competitiveness Study, with the consultants collaborating closely with TEDCO’s leadership and Maryland’s innovation ecosystem. “Maryland’s competitors are investing significantly in their innovation infrastructure and workforce. It’s time we do the same,” said Delegate Vanessa Atterbeary, chair of the Maryland House Ways and Means Committee. “The bad news is we’re not growing our tech economy at the rate we should. The good news is that Maryland has the potential to be a national tech leader, given our many assets and resources. Those include our state’s commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, a commitment that ensures we build and grow a tech ecosystem that taps into the talents of all our innovative entrepreneurs, benefiting communities across our great state.” The study identified several major challenges. Maryland’s overall economic growth rate is slowing, with real gross domestic product growing only 1.0% per year from 2011–2021.  If this continues, it will have a negative effect on job opportunities, livelihoods, and the state’s overall fiscal health. The high-tech sector is Maryland’s engine of growth, but the state needs high-tech employment growth of 3% to 4% per year compared to its past 10-year growth rate of 1.6% per year. The report also cited research from other studies that highlighted the underrepresentation of people of color and women in high-tech companies and startups. “We must choose to invest in inclusive and equitable approaches to diversify Maryland’s economy and drive impactful solutions that accelerate our position as a global leader in equitech,” said Brian Pieninck , president and CEO of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. “The Equitech Growth Fund is an opportunity to further elevate Maryland’s competitiveness, create new economic interest and drive an inclusive economic growth strategy for our region.” The study found that to move to a higher growth trajectory, Maryland needs to be proactive and develop a comprehensive strategy to spur stronger high-tech industry and innovation-led growth, make the needed investment to execute that growth, engage industry and diverse communities, and act quickly to remain competitive with other states in attracting and retaining industry and talent. Researchers cited a vision for inclusive tech and startup activity (“equitech”) that draws broadly on the brilliance and talent of the populace across neighborhoods and cultures. This ensures that founders, the workforce, mentors, investors and thought leaders are all included and active in shaping the tech ecosystem. “When we invest in our tech entrepreneurs across the state with programs like TEDCO’s Rural and Urban Business Innovative Initiatives, we see real success,” said Malcolm Augustine, senate president pro tem and member of the Education, Energy, and the Environment Committee. “We know here in Maryland that innovation isn’t about your address it’s about ideas. Now is the time for Maryland to act and invest at a scale that will enable it to truly pull ahead of competitors and become known as a top innovation state. We all benefit, from Maryland’s western mountains to our eastern shore and everyone in between.” Learn more by clicking here .","Brian Pieninck, Delegate Vanessa Atterbeary, Malcolm Augustine, pro tem","CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, Education, Energy, Equitech Growth Fund, Keen Point Consulting, Kirwan, Maryland Innovation Competitiveness Study, Marylanders, RTI International, The Equitech Growth Fund, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, senate, the Environment Committee, the General Assembly, the Maryland House Ways and Means Committee"

(January 18, 2023) – TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today its Venture Funds invested $750,000 in Neighborhood Sun , a tech-enabled community solar company increasing access to renewable energy solutions. TEDCO’s evergreen Venture Funds are dedicated to funding and growing the next generation of outstanding early-stage businesses in Maryland. “We are thrilled to have the opportunity to partner with TEDCO in building a powerful Maryland-based technology company that brings the promise of solar to everyone, not just the select few,” said Gary Skulnik, Founder and CEO of Neighborhood Sun. “TEDCO’s funding will enable us to expand our service offerings and invest more in our technology platform, Sun EngineTM , all while increasing our positive impact.” Neighborhood Sun, based in Silver Spring, Md., is a Certified B Corporation using its fully customizable community solar software, Sun EngineTM , to provide residents, organizations and businesses with access to the discounted renewable energy generated by local solar farms. This community solar model allows residents to support renewable energy without getting their own rooftop panel installations, eliminating typical barriers to solar access like income, location, and homeownership status. Through the retail subscription acquisition and management services provided, Neighborhood Sun offers a solution that connects solar farm developers with local individuals and businesses looking for access to affordable solar energy, allowing them to save money while reducing their carbon footprint and increasing equitable access to solar energy. “By connecting individuals to solar farms, Neighborhood Sun helps to provide a versatile eco-friendly energy solution to the public,” said Katherine Hill Ritchie , senior director of Venture Funds at TEDCO. “This technology solution benefits not only the individuals looking to use cleaner energy, but also the environment by creating less energy pollution, reducing the carbon footprint and creating more green jobs which, in turn, helps to promote a necessary transition to renewable energy.” TEDCO provides funding, resources and connections that early-stage technology and life sciences companies need to thrive in Maryland.

TEDCO and Senators Cardin and Van Hollen Announce Funding for Innovative Maryland Program | TEDCO,"Wednesday, January 11, 2023",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2023/tedco-and-senators-cardin-and-van-hollen-announce-funding,,Development & Marketing,"Wednesday, January 11, 2023 Columbia Omnibus Spending Bill includes $418,000 for Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneurs COLUMBIA, Md. (January 11, 2023) – TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today that its Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneur Excellence program was selected by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee for Fiscal Year 2023 Congressionally Directed Spending funding at a level of $418,000 – a direct federal funding request sponsored by U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). The funding for TEDCO’s 10-month leadership development program was included in the FY23 Omnibus Spending bill recently passed by Congress and signed into law by President Biden. “As Chairman of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, I have long been committed to leveling the playing field for our underserved entrepreneurs. Small business is a path of self-determination for many, especially Black women entrepreneurs,” said Senator Cardin. “TEDCO has demonstrated its ability to reach these small business owners and help their businesses grow and thrive. I’m proud we have secured $418,000 in direct federal investment for this project, which will foster the entrepreneurial spirit within Maryland’s HBCU community.” “To strengthen Maryland’s small businesses, we need to remove barriers to ensure that every entrepreneur has access to the resources and support to succeed. That’s why I fought to deliver this $418,000 direct federal investment in TEDCO’s Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneurs – to expand opportunity, boost startups, and leverage Maryland’s diverse talent to foster more leadership opportunities. I look forward to continuing to work with TEDCO to advance our shared commitment to equity in action,” said Senator Van Hollen, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. TEDCO’s Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneur Excellence was created to address barriers to success. While they lead the way in business formation, only 3% of Black women business owners are running mature businesses. Research cites three key reasons—the types of businesses, limited access to capital, and the uneven distribution of access to key resources needed for entrepreneurship success—as barriers to entry and catching-up of disadvantaged groups. The new program builds on a promising statistic for Maryland’s inclusive economy: at 52%, Maryland has the highest rate per capita of women-business ownership in the United States. “We are deeply appreciative of the efforts of Senators Van Hollen and Cardin, the Maryland congressional delegation members, and Congress for supporting and funding the Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneur Excellence in this year’s FY23 Omnibus Spending package,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall. “This funding supports local entrepreneurs in building critical skills, expanding their networks, and successfully growing their businesses—and the Maryland economy.” The first year of the Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneur Excellence is underway, starting as a pilot program in collaboration with Howard County Government , with plans to expand across the state. The program leverages the unique expertise of Maryland’s four HBCUs including Bowie State University , Coppin State University , Morgan State University , and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore . These Maryland HBCUs work with the cohort to determine their needs at the intersection of research, tech transfer and education. Another major component of the program is helping cohort members collaborate as a community and build their local and statewide networks. “We know that women-owned start-ups, particularly those led by Black women, face an array of challenges, including the all-important access to capital,” said Linda Singh , executive director for TEDCO’s Women Entrepreneur Leadership Programs . “Our Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneur Excellence will give local entrepreneurs the opportunity to collaborate, grow their networks, and navigate the local innovation ecosystem together. It’s a winning combination for the leaders, their companies and the state of Maryland.”","Ben Cardin, Biden, Bill, Cardin, Chris Van Hollen, Linda Singh, Van Hollen","Bowie State University, Columbia, Congress, Coppin State University, HBCU, Howard County Government, Morgan State University, Omnibus Spending, Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneur Excellence, Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneurs, TEDCO’s Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneur Excellence, TEDCO’s Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneurs, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, the Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneur Excellence, the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore"

(November 30, 2022)— TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today it has selected Recast Capital to help identify 3-4 traditionally underrepresented early-stage venture capital fund managers. In this role, Recast Capital will review and recommend venture fund managers that have the processes and structures to responsibly manage and invest up to $10 million U.S. Department of the Treasury SSBCI (State Small Business Credit Initiative) funds on behalf of TEDCO. Earlier this year TEDCO announced an infusion of up to $50 million in funding from Treasury State Small Business Credit Initiative. TEDCO’s SSBCI funds will be used to support recipients of TEDCO’s Venture Equity Fund, Seeds Funds Equity program, and Social Impact Funds—as well as the $10 million earmarked for the Venture Capital Limited Partner (VCLP) Equity program for which TEDCO has now selected Recast Capital to advise on the allocation of such VCLP funds. “Here at TEDCO, we know it takes time, effort and resources to truly foster an inclusive and entrepreneurial innovation ecosystem,” said TEDCO CEO, Troy LeMaile-Stovall . “Our VCLP strategy is focused on connecting with first-time, underrepresented fund managers who actively invest in Maryland. We’re excited to work with Recast Capital, which can connect us to those managers—and ultimately help us enhance economic empowerment across the great state of Maryland.” Recast Capital is a platform to invest in and support emerging managers in venture. Recast Capital’s focus areas include generating attractive returns via diversified exposure to emerging managers in venture providing investors with a unique information advantage in venture and democratizing access to information to empower the emerging manager community. “As part of our mission to support Maryland’s start-up ecosystem, TEDCO has managed relationships with several top-tier venture funds,” said Jack Miner , TEDCO chief investment officer. “We look forward to Recast Capital’s knowledgeable team to make recommendations that allow us to continue this work using our SSBCI allocation with highly qualified funds that have traditionally been underrepresented.” TEDCO issued the Request for Proposals (RFP) for Advisory and Allocation Services on July 11, 2022. The submission deadline for proposals was August 10, 2022. It was initially anticipated that the proposal evaluation process would be concluded, and a contract award announced by August 22. However, in light of the complexity of the services solicited by TEDCO and in order to thoroughly consider the nine proposals submitted in response to the RFP so that all respondents and their qualifications could be properly evaluated against the RFP requirements, TEDCO determined that additional time was necessary to complete the solicitation process. Of the nine proposals received by TEDCO in response to the RFP, several responding firms were owned by women and people of color. Recast Capital was selected in October, and the contract between Recast and TEDCO was finalized on November 10. “The next wave of innovation and returns in the venture market will be generated by diverse emerging managers. Fresh perspectives derived from diverse backgrounds is a uniquely competitive advantage in the market”, said Sara Zulkosky, co-founder and managing partner at Recast Capital. “At Recast, we are proud to support emerging managers with the perspectives needed to drive our industry ahead and look forward to assisting TEDCO identify such managers for their programs in Maryland.”","Jack Miner, Sara Zulkosky, TEDCO","Advisory and Allocation Services, Columbia Recast Capital, RFP, Recast, Recast Capital, Recast Capital’s, SSBCI, Seeds Funds Equity, Social Impact Funds, State Small Business Credit Initiative, TEDCO’s, TEDCO’s Venture Equity Fund, Treasury, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, U.S. Department, Venture Capital Limited Partner, the Venture Capital Limited Partner"
New TEDCO Programs Support Women Entrepreneurs | TEDCO,"Tuesday, November 29, 2022",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2022/new-tedco-programs-support-women-entrepreneurs-0,,,"Tuesday, November 29, 2022 Columbia Two cohorts of tech innovators selected for Howard and Montgomery County pilot programs COLUMBIA, Md. (November 29, 2022)— TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today the selection of 15 entrepreneurs to participate in two new 10-month pilot leadership development programs. In collaboration with local university and county partners, TEDCO created the Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneur Excellence in Howard County and the Leading Women’s Program in Montgomery County to support entrepreneurs in building critical skills, expanding their networks, and successfully growing their businesses. The two new pilot programs aim to build on a promising milestone: at 52%, Maryland has the highest rate per capita of women-business ownership in the United States. Nationally, 42% of all businesses are women-owned, employing 9.4 million workers and generating revenue of $1.9 trillion. Unfortunately, women-owned start-ups face an array of challenges, including the all-important access to capital. A Harvard Kennedy School study found that fledgling businesses with at least one woman on the founding team received only 13% of venture capital. And while Black women lead the way in business formation, only 3% are running mature businesses. Research cites three key reasons—the types of businesses, limited access to capital, and the uneven distribution of access to key resources needed for entrepreneurship success—as barriers to entry and catching-up of disadvantaged groups. TEDCO’s women entrepreneur leadership programs help ensure that Maryland continues its trajectory as an inclusive leader in the innovation economy. “The team at TEDCO is excited to get to work with these two cohorts of women entrepreneurs and our collaboration partners,” said Linda Singh , executive director for TEDCO’s Women Entrepreneur Leadership Program . “The participants will benefit from both the program offerings and our cohort model, where they’ll have the opportunity to collaborate, grow their networks, and navigate the local innovation ecosystem together. It’s a winning combination for the leaders, their companies, and ultimately, the state of Maryland.” The Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneur Excellence Cohort The Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneur Excellence is a Howard County-based pilot program in collaboration with Howard County Government . The program will leverage the unique expertise of Maryland’s four HBCUs including Bowie State University , Coppin State University , Morgan State University , and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore . The pilot program will take place at the Maryland Innovation Center (MIC) in Columbia, MD. Strategic supporters at the Maryland HBCUs will work with the cohort to determine their needs at the intersection of research, tech transfer, and education. Another major component of the program is helping cohort members collaborate as a community and build their local and statewide networks. The new program will also build an alliance of diverse founders and CEOs, beginning with Howard County in 2022 and expanding across the state in future years. The participants chosen to participate in the inaugural class are Adeola Ajani, Tricia Clarke, Shannon Collins, Malaika Dirieh, Modupe Eyo, Imani Hasell, Sabrina Mapp, Tiffany Page, Denise Rollins and Nik Sweeney. ""Here in Howard County, we value our small businesses and entrepreneurs—and we’re committed to public-private collaborations that ensure a fair playing field for all who choose to locate their businesses here,” said Howard County Executive Calvin Ball. “With programs like the new Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneur Excellence, we’re not only investing in the cohort and their startups, but also the economy and our future growth. It’s a win for everyone."" The Leading Women’s Program Cohort Created in collaboration with the Montgomery County Economic Development Corporation (MCEDC) , this community of tech-based female founders and CEOs began meeting in 2022. The 10-month Leading Women’s Program will be a combination of virtual and in-person courses held at the Universities at Shady Grove (USG) in Rockville, Md. Science and tech entrepreneurs will network and engage in a pilot program focused on leadership, communications, real world perspectives, and development plans. The participants chosen to participate in the inaugural class include Sue Carr, Hannah Dibonage, Joyce Fields, Jeannine Melican, and Raquel Vazquez. “ Montgomery County Economic Development Corporation (MCEDC) is excited to collaborate with TEDCO on this growth opportunity for women in our local tech start-up community,” said Bill Tompkins , President & CEO of MCEDC. “Montgomery County is Maryland’s most populous county, with women-owned businesses continuing to fuel the economy. With the Leading Women’s Program, we’re investing in innovative entrepreneurs who choose to start and grow their companies right here in the county.” To be eligible for either cohort, applicants were required to be a founder, co-founder, or CEO whose company is at a minimum of pre-seed to growth stage and a maximum of pre-series A.

It’s important for businesses to practice what they preach—standing by their word and communicating openly,” TEDCO’s CEO, Troy LeMaile-Stovall explains. “Tammi Thomas is the perfect exemplar of this value. And as the CMO at an organization that leads the innovation market, Tammi understands that we must be open to innovation as well.

(October 17, 2022)— TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today that Dr. Arti Santhanam , a key member of the TEDCO leadership team, was named a “World’s Inspiring Business Women Making a Difference, 2022.” As part of that recognition, Dr. Santhanam was featured in a cover story in World’s Leaders Magazine. As the Executive Director of TEDCO’s Maryland Innovation Initiative (MII) , Dr. Santhanam plays an essential role supporting TEDCO’s mission to enhance economic empowerment by fostering an inclusive and entrepreneurial innovation ecosystem. She leads the MII fund, which invests in commercialization and start-up science and tech companies that are spun out of five participating universities: Johns Hopkins University Morgan State University University of Maryland, Baltimore University of Maryland, Baltimore County University of Maryland, College Park. Established in 2012, MII has invested $47.5M that has resulted in 144 startups, $692M in follow-on funding and 7 exits to date. The World’s Leaders Magazine profile notes that Dr. Santhanam brings the right combination of skills, knowledge and empathy to her role with MII. As a childhood cancer survivor who went on the earn a PhD in microbiology and molecular genetics, Santhanam had experience as both a scientist and a patient. She could see ground-breaking science and tech happening at institutions where they weren’t thinking about getting it to market. At the same time, there were patients desperately hoping to access those discoveries for themselves or their families. Santhanam understood the power of the MII, which could help accelerate innovative solutions from bench to bedside. “The Maryland Innovative Initiative greatly benefits from Dr. Santhanam’s keen mind and entrepreneurial spirit. She understands the power of academic discovery and the life-changing possibilities that come with commercialization of those discoveries,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall , TEDCO CEO. “Arti Santhanam is truly a role model for innovators across the world and right here in Maryland, and her colleagues at TEDCO applaud her selection as a 2022 World’s Inspiring Business Women Making a Difference.” “I appreciate the opportunity to share my story with World’s Leaders Magazine and the support of the many people I work with through MII. Success does not occur without collaboration, a core value here at TEDCO and one I deeply value,” said Santhanam. “I’m very proud of the collective work that we’re doing together to build a diverse, vibrant tech-based entrepreneurial community that’s consistently ranked in the top five in the United States.” “On behalf of the Maryland Innovative Initiative Board, we congratulate Dr. Santhanam on this well-deserved recognition,” said Renee Winsky , MII board chair. “MII has thrived under her leadership, including supporting 144 start-ups with nearly $700 million in follow-on funding. Maryland’s university-based innovators and our state ecosystem benefit from Dr. Santhanam’s outstanding work and passion for the MII mission.” Dr. Santhanam’s accomplishments extend beyond her leadership work at MII. In order to fund ground-breaking research to treat Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer, Dr. Santhanam founded the METAvivor research program while serving on the board of directors of the Annapolis-based non-profit advocacy organization, METAvivor Research and Support, Inc. METAvivor was chosen as one of the top patient-run research programs in Vice President Joe Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative and has so far been granted over $7.8M in research grants. She also participates in Leadership Maryland ’20, the Maryland Energy Innovation Program (MEI2) investment committee, the Maryland Governor’s Life Science Advisory Board (LSAB), and the Women in Bio-Capital Region chapter. About MII The Maryland Innovation Initiative (MII) was established to support the transfer of cutting-edge innovations from the state’s five research institutions, where they were discovered, to the business sector, where they might be developed into goods and services that address identified market needs.","Arti Santhanam, Joe Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative, Renee Winsky, Santhanam","Annapolis, Baltimore County University of Maryland, Baltimore University of Maryland, Columbia MII Executive, Johns Hopkins University Morgan State University University of Maryland, METAvivor Research and Support, Inc., MII, Maryland Innovation Initiative, Santhanam, Success, TEDCO’s, The Maryland Innovation Initiative, The Maryland Innovative Initiative, The World’s Leaders Magazine, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, World’s Leaders Magazine, the Maryland Energy Innovation Program, the Maryland Innovative Initiative Board, the Women in Bio-Capital Region"

(October 11, 2022) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, has been awarded $125,000 by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) through its Federal and State Technology (FAST) Partnership Program. TEDCO is one of 44 recipients to receive the award, which will support TEDCO’s SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab . FAST funding exists to improve outcomes for women-owned, rural-based, and small disadvantaged businesses in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs by increasing their participation. Utilizing FAST funds, TEDCO helps prepare these small research and development firms to compete in the SBIR/STTR Program, which provided more than $4 billion in non-dilutive, early-stage seed capital in 2022. With the FAST grant, the TEDCO team will continue to offer the Maryland SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab , developed with the goal of improving proposal quality, submission rates, and win rates for women-owned, rural-based, and small disadvantaged businesses. The Maryland Proposal Lab has an established track record of doubling the award rate of Phase I SBIR/STTR applications through a series of training workshops, mentoring, expert proposal reviews, and targeted consulting culminating in proposal submission. The Maryland Proposal Lab uses the National Science Foundation (NSF) SBIR/STTR solicitation as a teaching tool because of its broad applicability in a variety of industries. Rural, women-owned, and socially disadvantaged entrepreneurs that have never won an SBIR/STTR Phase I award are especially encouraged to apply. “We know that SBIR/STTR awards can be game changers for our underrepresented businesses, and we thank the SBA for creating this award and recognizing TEDCO’s role in helping qualifying businesses with their award submissions,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall , TEDCO’s CEO. “The SBA’s FAST grant award closely aligns with TEDCO’s mission to foster an inclusive and entrepreneurial innovation ecosystem here in Maryland.” A cohort of approximately 25 companies will be selected to participate in the Maryland SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab. The workshops will guide the cohort from SBIR/STTR solicitation issuance through proposal submission. The Lab will also provide the cohort with the skillset to win other government and commercial proposals for the businesses’ long-term success. “TEDCO has a proven track record of helping Proposal Lab participants enhance their success rates with SBIR/STTR awards,” said Stephen Auvil , chief program operations officer, TEDCO. “This FAST grant award allows us to continue this work, and we encourage start-up founders with innovative ideas to reach out to TEDCO to learn how the Proposal Lab could help them improve the likelihood of receiving a non-dilutive early-stage SBIR/STTR award.” Dr. Elizabeth Clayborne , the founder of NasaClip, can attest to the effectiveness of TEDCO’s SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab: after participating in the lab, NasaClip received a $256,000 SBIR grant from the National Science Foundation. “As a member of TEDCO’s Proposal Lab cohort, I found the staff were true mentors throughout the SBIR Phase 1 application process, providing a structured step-by-step program that helped me tackle the daunting task of applying for an NSF SBIR Phase I grant,” said Clayborne. “The access to experienced advisors, coupled with extensive feedback, was crucial to my successful application.” We are selecting up to 25 companies to participate in a unique opportunity to join the next SBA FAST* SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab. The application period closes on December 31, 2022 or sooner if all the seats are filled. The application process is competitive and companies are admitted on a first-come, first-serve basis if they qualify. To apply, click here . Watch the Proposal Lab video to learn more by clicking here . The FAST award grant provides one year of funding to assist in implementing statewide programs to increase the number of proposals and awards and to prepare awardees for success beyond the program. TEDCO will use the funding to conduct virtual on-line workshops, pop-up in person events, and ad hoc after-hours sessions. To be awarded, candidates had to be endorsed by their state governor, as only one proposal was accepted from each state or territory. TEDCO was selected by the Governor as Maryland’s FAST team and will continue working with OST Global Solutions, Inc. (OST) and the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) to help small businesses write competitive proposals that win federal SBIR/STTR awards. Proposals were evaluated by panels of Federal reviewers led by the SBA.","Clayborne, Columbia Grant, Elizabeth Clayborne, Stephen Auvil","COLUMBIA, Federal and State Technology, NSF, OST, OST Global Solutions, Inc., Phase I SBIR/STTR, SBA, SBIR/STTR, Small Business Technology Transfer, TEDCO’s SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab:, The Maryland Proposal Lab, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, the Maryland SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab, the National Science Foundation, the Small Business Development Center, the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR, the U.S. Small Business Administration"

As Troy has said, “TEDCO’s Social Impact Funds are purposefully designed to engage and invest in economically underrepresented founders and communities. With each investment, we are working towards a more equitable tech ecosystem here in Maryland—while at the same time we get to elevate talented and innovative entrepreneurs across the state.” “Troy has worked to ensure that no part of Maryland is left behind in our innovation ecosystem,” said Myra Norton , president and CEO of Arena Analytics, immediate past chair of TEDCO Board of Directors . “As one of many examples, he oversaw the creation of the Agriculture and Rural Rebuild (ARR) Challenge , which encouraged purposeful collaboration between rural businesses, research institutions and industry partners. The ARR Challenge awarded grants to seven projects from a diverse pool of applicants from every region of the State and a variety of technology industries.” Most Admired CEOs honors talented business CEOs, higher education leaders and nonprofit executive directors throughout Maryland whose leadership and vision are admired by those around them. A panel of judges selects these winners based on professional accomplishments, community service and the letters of references submitted by co-workers, board members and community leaders showing the CEOs leadership and vision. “I admire Troy for his passion, his sense of community, his commitment to doing good, and his core humanity,” said Ken Malone, executive officer, Early Charm Ventures. “Under Troy’s leadership, TEDCO has implemented new DEI initiatives , grown the existing funds that support Maryland’s startup community, and advocated for new funds, including $50M from the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) , a federal program designed to target communities and areas with a high concentration of small, micro, and socially and economically disadvantaged individual businesses.” The Most Admired CEOs winners will be honored Nov. 3 at the Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport, 1739 W.

(September 14, 2022) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today it has selected RTI International (RTI) and its partner Keen Point Consulting to analyze Maryland’s national position in cybersecurity, the life sciences, and advanced and emerging technology industries, producing a study that will shape Maryland’s innovation competitiveness strategy. “We have an ambitious but attainable goal here in Maryland: to vault our state to the list of top-10, fastest-growing innovation economies, with the economic benefits shared broadly by all Marylanders,” said TEDCO CEO, Troy LeMaile-Stovall . “TEDCO has selected RTI and its knowledgeable experts to perform the analysis needed to reach that goal, and we’re eager to get started on this crucial work that will both accelerate our state’s innovation economy and offer exciting new career opportunities to residents who have been under-represented in Maryland’s advanced tech fields.” The Maryland General Assembly tasked TEDCO with overseeing the study, which will include an examination of publicly financed advanced industry investment funds in other states and an analysis of minority participation in Maryland’s advanced technology industry careers. RTI will begin work this month, with a completed report due by December 30, 2022. “This study is crucial to our goal of increasing the number of companies working in high-growth, high wage industry sectors like cybersecurity, medtech and therapeutics. RTI and partner Keen Point Consulting have a deep understanding of the factors driving innovation- and technology-based economic growth and development, as well as the data that can be used to identify potential targets for Maryland’s innovation strategy, including increasing the participation of people of color and diverse communities,” said Stephen Auvil , TEDCO Chief Program Operations Officer. RTI International and Keen Point Consulting RTI International is an independent, nonprofit research institute dedicated to improving the human condition by turning knowledge into practice. RTI works to deliver reliable data, thorough analysis, innovative methods, novel technologies, and sustainable programs that help clients inform public policy and ground practice in evidence. Their global staff of nearly 6,000 works in more than 75 countries—tackling hundreds of projects each year to address complex social and scientific challenges on behalf of governments, businesses, foundations, universities, and other clients and partners . RTI’s partner for this project is Keen Point Consulting , a small, minority-owned (African American) firm whose President specializes in technology-based economic development and brings practical experience developing and implementing programs to support founders of color and their businesses. RTI and Keen Point have partnered on the creation of three state science and technology plans over the last 3 years. Charge from Maryland Legislature TEDCO has been charged by the Maryland General Assembly to deliver a report on the effectiveness and impact of the State’s current economic development strategy or actions as it relates to specific areas, including financial, policy, and governance recommendations for the establishment of a Maryland Equitech Growth Fund. TEDCO will use the final report to begin a statewide strategic planning process that will include building a consensus around the steps needed to make Maryland a top-ten, fastest-growing innovation economy by 2033 and a top ten global innovation economy by 2050. Initial thinking about this effort suggests a need to focus on creating a culture of innovation, entrepreneurship, and leadership across all communities in Maryland with a specific focus on our youth, the future leaders of our business community. Request for Proposals TEDCO sent out a Request for Proposals (RFP) on June 24, 2022. The RFP sought qualified firms that could collect data, perform analyses and generate a final report on several specific areas associated with the impact of Maryland’s current economic development strategy or actions—especially as it applies to ensuring Maryland’s long-term leadership in building an inclusive, advanced, tech-based, innovation and entrepreneurial culture across the state. The proposal due date was August 1. A total of 14 firms submitted competitive applications, which were reviewed and scored according to criteria set forth in the RFP. Four finalists were selected and interviewed and RTI was selected. The company was engaged on September 9. A final report will be delivered by December 30, 2022.","Keen Point, Keen Point Consulting, Stephen Auvil","Columbia Study, Keen Point Consulting, Marylanders, RTI International, State, The Maryland General Assembly, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, the Maryland General Assembly"

(September 13, 2022) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today its Builder Fund invested $100,000 in Treevo , a DEI technology start-up based in Maryland. TEDCO’s Builder Fund invests in and provides executive support to Maryland-based technology companies run by entrepreneurs who demonstrate economic disadvantage. “On behalf of Treevo, we’d like to thank TEDCO for believing in our product and its potential,” said Tywande Barnes, founder and CEO of Treevo . “The Builder Fund offers the right infusion of funds at the right time for our growing company, allowing us to further hone our app design and elevate the user experience.” Treevo, based in Upper Marlboro, Md., developed a free social media application designed to unify followers and followings across platforms. With its integrated features and tools, Treevo has the ability to create a new sub industry under the social networking umbrella. “TEDCO is proud to support innovative technology products like Treevo’s new app, aimed at giving social media users more options and agency,” said Jean-Luc Park , senior director of Social Impact Funds at TEDCO. “TEDCO’s Builder Fund was created to help innovators like those at Treevo, entrepreneurs who have an abundance of talent and ideas but may lack connections or access to capital. Under-represented businesses working in innovative tech spaces should reach out to TEDCO for support and possibly funding.” “Think of Treevo as the social media version of Amazon/Walmart,” said Michael Ogunyemi, the Chief Marketing Officer of Treevo. “Both of these companies created a user centered marketplace where they not only sell their own products and services, but offer products from other vendors as well. We’re building our users a platform they curate themselves, while fostering their ability to leverage their existing social equity.” For entrepreneurs applying for their first investment from TEDCO’s Builder Fund, their company must be based in Maryland and led by an economically disadvantaged founder(s).

This Tech Fair will give our state’s small businesses a chance to learn how to use technology to grow their businesses.

The organization has an ambitious vision: TEDCO will be the recognized national leader for supporting translational research, and technology-based, economic, and entrepreneurial development while being the hub of Maryland’s innovation ecosystem. TEDCO is a technology-based economic development (TBED) organization. It was created in 1998 by the Maryland State Legislature to facilitate the transfer and commercialization of technology from Maryland’s research universities and federal labs into the marketplace, and to assist in the creation and growth of technology-based businesses in the State. Over the past 24 years, the organization has evolved into an organization with three major areas of focus: technology advancement, investments, and entrepreneurial & ecosystem support. TEDCO is, among other things, a resource for mentoring, funding, and networking for entrepreneurs and start-ups that need guidance as they bring innovative concepts to market. It is more than an early-stage funding resource it is also a hub of Maryland’s entrepreneurial network where start-ups find mentors, organization assistance, facilities for daily operations, and a roadmap for success.",,"Board, Columbia New, Equitech Growth Fund, State, TBED, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, the Maryland State Legislature, the State Finance and Procurement Article"

TEDCO’s New Women Leadership Programs Empowering Maryland’s Entrepreneurs | TEDCO,"Wednesday, March 23, 2022",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2022/tedcos-new-women-leadership-programs-empowering-marylands,,Equal Access Initiative,"Wednesday, March 23, 2022 Columbia An alliance with Maryland’s HBCUs enables promising, diverse, and underrepresented women business leaders a more equitable future COLUMBIA, Md. (March 23, 2022) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today the launch of its new Women Entrepreneur Leadership Programs. The new programs are designed to build an alliance of diverse founders and CEOs to strategically navigate Maryland’s entrepreneurial innovation ecosystem. In collaboration with Maryland’s four Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), TEDCO’s new programs will focus on creating a diversified community of women entrepreneurs and help them grow their companies. “Using the input from TEDCO’s Task Force for Women Entrepreneurs to develop the course foundation, we were able to create a one-of-a-kind program focusing on mitigating challenges Black women entrepreneurs face,” Linda Singh , executive director for TEDCO’s Women Entrepreneur Leadership. The leadership program kicks off with a pilot program in Howard County at the Maryland Innovation Center (MIC) . The Open Institute for Black Women Entrepreneur Excellence will convene a cohort of 25 women entrepreneurs, with the goal of developing a network of peer advisors and creating a collaborative community. The HBCUs will determine the needs of these entrepreneurs at the intersection of research, tech transfer and education. Maryland’s HBCUs include Bowie State University , Coppin State University , Morgan State University , and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore . “Recent numbers show the continued challenges faced by early-stage women entrepreneurs –2.3% of venture funding went to women in 2020, down from an all time high of 2.8% in 2019, yet 42% of all business are women owned,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall , TEDCO CEO. “TEDCO recognizes the need to ensure all Marylanders, especially women, given that the state has the highest rate per capita of women-owned businesses, are provided the proper opportunities and exposure to realize their dreams. This pilot with our friends in Howard County represents our commitment to ensure our dreams become reality and access to wealth inclusion and expansion opportunities are realized.” To be eligible for the cohort, applicants must be a founder, co-founder, or CEO whose company is at a minimum of pre-seed to growth stage and a maximum of pre-series A. Watch the webinar to find out more about the program by visiting https://youtu.be/LmUSLXU8Egc . The new program builds on past work by TEDCO as it works to support women and underrepresented entrepreneurs. In 2016, TEDCO commissioned a study into the demographics of those start-ups applying for funding and support from TEDCO to try to identify underserved entrepreneurs. As a result of that study, TEDCO launched the Minority Business Pre-Seed Fund, which eventually became the Builder Fund for start-ups run by entrepreneurs who demonstrate economic disadvantage. In 2019, TEDCO went further by convening its Task Force for Women Entrepreneurs . The 12 thought leaders in the Maryland entrepreneurial ecosystem were tasked with identifying and implementing concrete actions to drive outcomes for women entrepreneurs in the state. The task force came to a close with the recommendation of implementing these programs into the state’s entrepreneurial ecosystem.

(March 15, 2022)— TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today the successful exits of 15 portfolio companies in 2021. The portfolio companies received a total of $7 million from three TEDCO funds and reported a total fair market value in 2021 of over $12.6 million. “We’re glad that these TEDCO investments resulted in a multitude of benefits for both the exiting companies and our state,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall , TEDCO CEO. “While founders celebrate their thriving companies, Maryland also benefits from the addition of new and diverse innovators to our state ecosystem, the creation of good-paying tech jobs for residents, and an expanded tax base to fund Maryland’s top priorities.” Exits are meaningful for many startup founders and investors, as well as more broadly for an entrepreneurial ecosystem. An exit is the deal where the company sells its stock to another company, a private equity firm, or does an initial public offering (IPO). The exiting companies received investments from TEDCO’s Builder , Seed and Venture Funds from 2014 to 2020. The companies produce an array of tech products ranging from privacy protection to healthcare and educational software and platforms. “We’re proud to have connected with these successful companies in their earliest stages and help set them on a growth trajectory. One example is Xometry , which received support from our Venture Funds and recently made Deloitte’s nationwide list of the 500 fastest growing technology companies in North America,” said Jack Miner , chief investment officer at TEDCO. “We encourage emerging Maryland tech entrepreneurs to reach out to us to identify ways to launch your success story through one of our investment funds.” Entrepreneurs have a variety of fund options to explore, to include the following: The Social Impact Funds are purposefully designed to engage and invest in economically disadvantaged founders and communities.

The Seed Funds are a family of four funds each investing in early-stage technology and life sciences companies. Investments are made through convertible debt and equity instruments with support ranging from $100,000 to $500,000.

"Givhero receives investment from Maryland Momentum Fund, TEDCO, and Conscious Venture Partners to use intrinsic motivation to increase adoption and engagement in wellness programs | TEDCO","Monday, March 7, 2022",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2022/givhero-receives-investment-maryland-momentum-fund-tedco-and,,Social Impact Funds,"Monday, March 7, 2022 Columbia GAITHERSBURG, MD (March 7, 2022) – Givhero, Inc. (“Givhero”), an employee well-being platform that leverages employees’ intrinsic motivation to increase adoption, retention, and engagement in well-being programs, closed its SEED round with participation from Conscious Venture Fund II, Swerve Limited, TEDCO and other angel investors in addition to the University System of Maryland Momentum Fund . Givhero leverages charitable causes, challenges, peer recognition, team competition and gamification strategies to enhance the employee experience. Givhero is increasing program adoption and engagement in employee wellness programs which reduces absenteeism and increases productivity for employers. Current wellness programs have low adoption rates, high administrative burden, and low program engagement. Covid-19 has magnified some of these problems. Using their unique approach to wellness, most of Givhero’s clients have increased program participation by 50% over previous programs and their retention and engagement in wellness programs is more than 90%. “We fundamentally care about improving the well-being of employees and supporting the community causes they care about, for maximum social impact. We have an enterprise product with years of actionable data.” said Vishal Chintawar , Founder of Givhero. “We have been a great resource for our clients across the globe especially by leveraging our virtual programs during the remote work environment.” Designed to be easy to implement and participate, the employer pays an annual SaaS fee and funds employee selected nonprofit causes through healthy behaviors. “Vishal is driven, focused, and very coachable, but is in a busy, fragmented space. That said, this technology is quite advanced, the strategy of giving back to non-profits is unique and personalized, and the company has seen an excellent growth trajectory” said Claire Broido Johnson , Managing Director of the Maryland Momentum Fund. “We look forward to the data that proves employee retention and more and are pleased that 90% of Givhero’s members say the connection to local charities motivated them to meet their health goals. Employers, especially during the pandemic, have had to find new innovative ways to engage remote employees and keep them healthy.” “One of the most important societal issues being addressed by companies today is the lack of employee engagement. According to a recent Gallup survey, in 2021 66% of U.S. employees were either disengaged or actively disengaged in their work. Not only is working in an organization that doesn’t care for your well-being a soul crushing way to live, with the requisite impacts on society at large. It’s estimated that this is costing U.S. companies between $400-$500 billion dollars each year,” said Jeff Cherry , Founder and Managing General Partner of Conscious Venture Partners .  “The Givhero team is focused on curing this problem for companies in a unique way that also improves employee wellness. We believe that is bound to create a business that cares for all stakeholders. A true win-win-win situation and we are proud to be on this journey with them.” “ TEDCO invests in tech companies that not only provide a cutting-edge product or service, but also demonstrate an exemplary business model. Givhero provided us an excellent example of this through its technological innovation and well-established customer demand,” said Jean-Luc Park , senior director of TEDCO’s Social Impact Funds . “Givhero’s focus on sales and innovation, tied to their core goals of healthier employers and increased community support for nonprofits, bode well for their future success.” For more information on Givhero, please visit givhero.com .

(March 3, 2022) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today the selection of 26 Maryland companies to participate in its FY2022 SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab cohort, now in its fourth year. As part of the cohort, the companies will work closely with TEDCO experts on preparing polished proposals for up to $275,000 in federal awards through the SBIR/STTR Phase 1 program. The 26 companies in this year’s cohort conduct cutting-edge research in a variety of disciplines, from medical devices to learning and cognition technologies—and even edible bugs ! “TEDCO’s Proposal Lab plays an essential role in preparing Maryland companies to apply for SBIR awards, helping them develop and deliver compelling, competitive, and compliant proposals that clearly communicate their solutions to funding decision makers,” said TEDCO CEO Troy LeMaile-Stovall . “The SBIR program offers companies an important opportunity to apply for nondilutive funding, and TEDCO is committed to working with this new cohort to ensure they are best positioned to access that support.” What is SBIR/STTR? Housed in the U.S. Small Business Administration, the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are highly competitive programs that encourage small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/R&D) with the potential for commercialization. Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR and STTR enable small businesses to explore their technological potential and provide the incentive to profit from its commercialization. How TEDCO Prepares Maryland Companies to Apply for SBIR/STTR Awards As part of the FY2022 SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab cohort, the 26 companies will participate in TEDCO’s five-month lab, where they work with experts from OST Global Solutions to craft their own proposal to apply for SBIR/STTR funding. The cohort will receive access to TEDCO’s market research tools, support from the Maryland Small Business Development Center (SBDC), hear directly from experts from different government SBIR funding agencies, and receive two reviews of their proposal by a total of five experts. “Before TEDCO’s Proposal Lab experience, my co-founder and I had never applied for an SBIR grant,” stated Mustafa Al-Adhami, CEO of Astek Diagnostics Inc . “The Proposal Lab was instrumental to enhancing our application and we are pleased to say that our submittal was successful. I highly encourage entrepreneurs to join the proposal lab."" Proposal Lab Participants Higher Success Rate Companies that complete TEDCO’s Proposal Lab and submit proposals have an average award rate of 39%, more than double the 15% national average for Phase I SBIR awards. “The Proposal Lab provided a very structured step by step program that helped me to tackle the daunting task of applying for a NSF SBIR Phase I grant,” said Dr. Elizabeth P. Clayborne, inventor and founder of NasaClip. “I felt confident in the experienced advisors who made it easy to understand what was needed to submit a strong application and the feedback from them and my peer group was super helpful!” According to the SBA, SBIR/STTR Phase I awards are generally $50,000 - $275,000 for six months to one year. “It’s not surprising that each year, we see an increase in the number of applicants, given this exciting funding opportunity and TEDCO’s proven track record. What’s particularly unique about this cohort is how diligent they were in getting right to work as soon as they learned of their selection,” said Kim Mozingo , director of TEDCO’s Federal Programs . “They are a committed, highly communicative, coachable, and engaging group, and we envision a significant number of success stories out of this cohort.” “TEDCO plays an important role in supporting Maryland entrepreneurs. This cohort focuses on minority and women-owned small businesses that bring groundbreaking ideas that would create tremendous impact on our society, from reducing payloads for space exploration to removing brain tumors with minimal invasiveness,” said Olessia Smotrova, president and CEO of OST Global Solutions , TEDCO’s teaming partner.

TEDCO Announces Elizabeth Good Mazhari as DEI Advisor | TEDCO,"Monday, December 13, 2021",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2021/tedco-announces-elizabeth-good-mazhari-dei-advisor,,Equal Access Initiative,"Monday, December 13, 2021 Columbia COLUMBIA, Md. (December 13, 2021) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today the selection of Elizabeth Good Mazhari as the new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) advisor for the organization. As DEI Advisor, Mazhari joins the TEDCO Executive Leadership Team and will be developing and implementing DEI strategy that includes short-term and long-term goals and metrics for the following four areas: Administration, Talent Management, Programs and Funding. Within this role, Mazhari will develop tools, policies and programs that will enable TEDCO to track its progress and deliver an inclusive and equitable TEDCO experience for internal and external stakeholders. She brings more than 25 years of academic, government and private sector experience to the new role. “The addition of the DEI Advisor to our Leadership team very much aligns with TEDCO’s core values of accountability, collaboration, respect, integrity and stewardship,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall , TEDCO CEO. “We are committed to creating a culture of belonging here at TEDCO, and embracing and leveraging differences both within our organization and with the many businesses we mentor, fund and support. We know that a real commitment to diversity and inclusion benefits not only our employees, organization and partners, but the greater economy as well.” Research from Korn Ferry and others shows the many benefits of effective diversity and inclusion practices. Diverse and inclusive teams are shown to make better decisions 87% of the time, are 70% more likely to capture new markets, and are 76% more likely to see ideas become productized. 1 The new DEI Advisor role will further strengthen TEDCO’s vision of becoming a national leader in supporting and funding/investing in companies founded and/or led by under-represented innovators and entrepreneurs, while providing an exceptional work environment and enhanced organizational results. To ensure the sustainability and continuous progression of the initiatives from the DEI Advisor role, there is not a set timeline for the term of this position. The challenges facing underrepresented technology innovators and entrepreneurs will not be fixed overnight, thus requiring long term attention and solutions to the problems. “I am honored to be entrusted with the new DEI Advisor role and to support the organization in strengthening its long-term focus on enhancing its DEI practices,” said Mazhari. “It’s never too late to start taking action and making the necessary changes to encourage a positive impact both within the organization and on the community.” 1 https://www.kornferry.com/insights/featured-topics/diversity-equity-inclusion/guide-to-dei-in-the-workplace","DEI Advisor, Elizabeth Good Mazhari, Korn Ferry, Leadership, Mazhari","DEI, DEI Advisor, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Mazhari, Talent Management, Programs and Funding, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, the DEI Advisor"

Opal HTM then analyzes this data to pinpoint costly inefficiencies, helping hospital staff sharply reduce equipment-related expenses through optimized inventory, procurement, and maintenance without compromising quality of patient care. “We’re thrilled to have TEDCO on board as an investor in Opal HTM. TEDCO’s RBII has been an invaluable partner to Opal HTM since our earliest days, and we owe so much of our continued growth and success to the resources they have provided,” said Connor Roberts, Founder. “I’d like to give a shoutout to Tiffany Davis, our RBII mentor, whose frequent strategy sessions kept us grounded and on track towards commercialization even in the face of a global pandemic. This investment marks a new, exciting chapter in our partnership with TEDCO, and we look forward to leveraging these resources towards our mission of improving hospital efficiency through optimized healthcare technology management.” TEDCO’s RBII is designed to enhance technology commercialization and provide technical and business assistance to small and early-stage companies in rural Maryland.

(October 6, 2021)— TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today its collaboration with various Maryland partners in creating the BlueTechMD Consortium (BlueTechMD). The goal of BlueTechMD, comprised of for-profits, universities, and non-profits, is to attract more of the myriad of climate tech investors and blue tech entrepreneurs to Maryland, and create more collaborative opportunities and solutions to solve our climate change problems. The challenges to our waters are unprecedented and acute with acidification, warming and sea level rise, pollution, and the loss of critical marine biodiversity. The Maryland ecosystem, with its breadth and depth of capabilities, is naturally poised to join other emerging blue tech clusters. Blue Tech is defined as aquaculture, offshore wind, sustainable maritime, stormwater and flooding management, bay and ocean restoration, urban waterfront, and more. Our goal is to build on our region’s core competencies to make Maryland one of the top blue tech innovation hubs and center of excellence in the country. The Maryland market’s assets include: great anchor institutions with an educated workforce, proximity to federal government resources and the Chesapeake Bay, and accessibility to customers and organizations that help start-ups scale. “BlueTechMD is bringing a multitude of collaborations together to support technological advancements in areas that include sustainable aquaculture, offshore wind, and the health of our harbors and oceans - issues that will improve lives” said Russell Hill, executive director, Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology (IMET). “The Blue Tech industry has a strong future in Maryland, and we’re looking forward to building a more sustainable future of growth for the industry and companies in Maryland.” In partnership with TEDCO , the Maryland Momentum Fund , IMET , Early Charm Ventures , Ferry Cove Shellfish , and others, BlueTechMD will host its inaugural BlueNexus event on Tuesday, November 16, 2021 at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. The event will include an investor discussion, a roundtable discussion, and information on what benefits Maryland has to offer entrepreneurs and investors. There will also be an announcement of a new partnership with two other blue economy/blue tech innovation cluster groups and information about a future business plan contest. Companies interested in participating should contact Claire Broido Johnson, cbjohnson@umaryland.edu .

If we want to see more companies, technologies and jobs, we need to focus on bringing more funding and support to develop the State’s Blue Tech ecosystem.” “Maryland has all of the right assets to make it to a top three center of Blue Tech innovation in the country,” said Claire Broido Johnson, managing director, Maryland Momentum Fund. “Our group wants to energize the ecosystem and bring more Blue Tech entrepreneurs and investors to Maryland.” To learn more about the BlueTechMD Consortium , to include how to join, please visit https://bluetechmd.com/ .","Brian Toll, Claire Broido Johnson, Ferry Cove Shellfish, Russell Hill, UpSurge Baltimore","Blue Tech, BlueNexus, Consortium, Early Charm Ventures, Environmental Technology Maryland Clean Energy Center Maryland Department of Commerce Maryland Department of Natural Resources Maryland Energy Innovation, IMET, Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology, Maryland Momentum Fund, Maryland Momentum Fund Maryland Technology Development Corporation, Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute University System, State’s Blue Tech, The Blue Tech, https://bluetechmd.com/, the BlueTechMD Consortium, the Maryland Energy Innovation Accelerator, the Maryland Momentum Fund, the State’s Blue Tech, the University of Maryland"

TEDCO Receives Grant from The U.S. Small Business Administration Awards | TEDCO,"Friday, September 3, 2021",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2021/tedco-receives-grant-us-small-business-administration-awards,,SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab,"Friday, September 3, 2021 Columbia Agency awards 33 state, local grants to support small business innovation, research and development COLUMBIA, Md. (September 7, 2021) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, received a grant from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to further enhance the organization’s success in stimulating economic growth throughout the state. TEDCO received $125,000 as one of 33 awards granted by the SBA under the Federal and State Technology (FAST) Partnership Program. FAST funding exists to improve outcomes for women-owned, rural-based, and small disadvantaged businesses in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs by increasing participation. The support FAST provides helps these small research and development firms compete in the SBIR/STTR Program—which for 2022 will have more than $4 billion in non-dilutive, early-stage seed capital. Selected by the Governor as Maryland’s FAST team, through the support of the SBA, TEDCO will continue working with OST Global Solutions, Inc. (OST), and the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) to help small businesses write competitive proposals that win federal SBIR/STTR awards. With the FAST grant, the TEDCO team will continue to offer the Maryland SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab , developed with the goal of improving proposal quality, submission rates, and win rates for women-owned, rural-based, and small disadvantaged businesses. The Maryland Proposal Lab has an established track record of doubling the award rate of Phase I SBIR/STTR applications through a series of training workshops, mentoring, expert proposal reviews, and targeted consulting culminating in proposal submission. The Maryland Proposal Lab uses the National Science Foundation (NSF) SBIR/STTR solicitation as a teaching tool because of its broad applicability in a variety of industries. Rural, women-owned, and socially disadvantaged entrepreneurs that have never won an SBIR/STTR Phase I award are especially encouraged to apply. “At TEDCO, we pride ourselves in being a one-stop shop for collaboration, coaching and capital for Maryland’s entrepreneurs,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall , TEDCO’s CEO. “These companies will gain significant benefits from the value TEDCO brings to the table. We’re looking forward to seeing the future growth and impact they will have on Maryland’s start-up community.” A cohort of approximately 25 companies will be selected to participate in the Maryland SBIR/STTR Proposal Lab. The workshops will guide the cohort from SBIR/STTR solicitation issuance through proposal submission. The Lab will also provide the cohort with the skillset to win with other government and commercial proposals for the businesses’ long-term success. Interested companies should apply early for best consideration. Applications are reviewed on an ongoing basis and will close on December 15, 2021. To apply, visit https://www.tedcomd.com/funding/tech-transfer/federal-tech-transfer/sbirproposal . Watch the Proposal Lab video to learn more by clicking here . “In collaboration with our partners, we’re taking a holistic approach to educating companies that sometimes get left behind,” said Kimberly Mozingo , director of federal programs, TEDCO. “We’ll teach skills that provide a lifelong benefit and introduce them to TEDCO resources such as the industry experts who review their proposals and connect them with the broader Maryland ecosystem of support. Thus far, we’ve increased the win rate for women-owned businesses almost sevenfold, and I’d like to see us do that for everyone in the cohort.” The FAST award grant provides one year of funding to assist in implementing statewide programs to increase the number of proposals and awards and to prepare awardees for success beyond the program. TEDCO will use the funding to conduct virtual on-line workshops, pop-up in person events, and ad hoc after-hours sessions. To be awarded, candidates had to be endorsed by their state governor as only one proposal was accepted from each state or territory. Proposals were evaluated by panels of Federal reviewers led by the SBA. # # # About SBIR/STTR SBA coordinates the SBIR/STTR programs, also known as America’s Seed Fund, which for FY 2020 will have more than $4 billion in early stage seed capital which will result in over 7,000 awards to small businesses. Eleven participating federal agencies announce funding opportunities as either grants or contracts to address their research and development needs. Companies supported by the SBIR/STTR programs often generate some of the most important breakthroughs each year in the U.S.  Additional information about the programs, as well as past and current topics can be found at www.sbir.gov . About the U.S. Small Business Administration The U.S. Small Business Administration helps power the American dream of business ownership. As the only go-to resource and voice for small businesses backed by the strength of the federal government, the SBA empowers entrepreneurs and small business owners with the resources and support they need to start, grow or expand their businesses, or recover from a declared disaster.

The newly appointed chair of the board is Morgan State University’s (MSU) Omar Muhammad, replacing Myra Norton, CEO of Arena Analytics. “I don’t take this opportunity for granted. Working with other board members several years ago, we were able to provide diversity by investing in entrepreneurs (African American and women) and staffing. It is an honor to take the role of chair for this innovative and driven organization,” said Omar Muhammad, chair of the board, and director of MSU’s Entrepreneurial Development and Assistance Center (EDAC). “Myra served as chair with the utmost integrity and I intend to continue the momentum in this next year. After the challenges (Global Pandemic and Racial Inequities) posed on all of us last year, we plan to find more ways to support our entrepreneurs as we navigate this new economy.” “Omar brings many years of experience leading support for Maryland’s entrepreneurs. His service as board chair for TEDCO will be a gift both to TEDCO and to the State” said Myra Norton, former chair of the board, and CEO of Arena Analytics. “I’m looking forward to seeing this new board leadership continue building the organization for its next stage of growth in service of a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem in Maryland.” TEDCO’s new elected officials include the following diverse slate: Chair – Omar S.

TEDCO and I are truly indebted to her.” “Excited seems too small a word for how I feel about having Omar as TEDCO chair,” said LeMaile-Stovall. “His energy, passion and creativity will amplify TEDCO’s mission to new heights.

7 Grants Funded Through TEDCO’s Agriculture and Rural Rebuild Challenge | TEDCO,"Wednesday, July 7, 2021",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2021/7-grants-funded-through-tedcos-agriculture-and-rural-rebuild,,Agriculture and Rural Rebuild (ARR) Challenge,"Wednesday, July 7, 2021 Columbia Encouraging purposeful collaboration between rural businesses, research institutions and industry partners COLUMBIA, Md. (July 7, 2021) – TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today it has awarded 7 projects to receive grants through its Agriculture and Rural Rebuild (ARR) Challenge . This challenge was created for applicants across the state to collaborate with either a research institution, industry and/or rural agricultural entity to help develop lasting and sustainable, technology-enabled improvements in Agtech and other rural industries. Through a request for applications announced in March 2021 , TEDCO received 31 applications from all regions of the State. “The funding for the ARR Challenge helps to foster more collaborations throughout the state that will ultimately create more jobs in our agriculture industry,” said Governor Larry Hogan.  “This initiative is another stellar example of how our administration is committed to fully recovering from this pandemic and growing our state’s economy together.” The companies that received funding from the ARR Challenge, with grants up to $200,000 include: Catoctin Mountain Growers (CMG) , based in Keymar, Md., is an established small business that grows and distributes plants. JumpLights , a startup based in Gaithersburg, Md., is the technology industry partner whose purpose is to provide horticultural LED lighting. Achieving project objectives means that in the next ten years, CMG can triple revenues from $10M to $30M, double the greenhouse facility size and employ an additional 60 FTEs. JumpLights will be able to double its workforce in the next year and reach $18M in revenue and 30 employees within five years. Athena Environmental Sciences , based in Baltimore, Md., has developed a proprietary manufacturing process for producing chitin-oligosaccharides. These compounds exhibit anti-fungal and anti-nematode properties—two plant parasites that cause billions of dollars in crop damage annually. Of growing concern is not only the rise in resistance to front-line treatments, but also the introduction of toxins from treatments as well as pathogens into the food chain. Therefore, there is a need for alternative treatment options that are safe and effective. Chitin-oligosaccharide, which are presently not commercially available, are safe and effective biopesticides that improve crop productivity when applied as a soil amendment, foliage spray or seed coating. Grateful Gardeners , based in Boyds, Md., is an organic, sustainable boutique flower farm, specializing in the unique and uncommon cut flower varieties, and focusing on the environment and furthering sustainable agriculture in a myriad of approaches. Currently developing a novel process that employs aquaponics to grow high dollar value cut flower cultivars, like Dahlias and Lisianthus year-round. Aquaponics is the greenest way to grow plants, utilizing fish waste in a water circulating, closed loop system. It is highly sustainable and has the power to revolutionize floriculture. Croppers Farm, LLC , based in Hebron, Md., is a working farm offering garden produce to sell at Farmer's Markets. The focus of the project is to repurpose poultry houses, turning them back into productive assets for farmers and growers, and to improve access to year-round nutritious food by growing a variety of agricultural and aquacultural products, and other non-food functions to create economic development and jobs for the region. This can be used as a model for other rural areas. Mark Street Aquafarms, LLC, based in Bel Air, Md., is an aquaculture company. The proposed project brings Mark Street Aquafarms and IMET—an internationally renowned research and development facility—to support the establishment of a shrimp farm in Northeastern Maryland. The collaboration will identify optimized conditions and processes for culture of shrimp at high density, demonstrating that shrimp can be aquacultured in rural areas, creating jobs, and promoting economic resilience. Kick Robotics, LLC , based in Bethesda, Md., has developed an autonomous environmental robot sensing platform that uses Advanced Analytics/AI to collectively sense and navigate over wide areas for real-time prediction, classification, and detection. The low-cost autonomous amphibious environmental robots monitor, and measure environmental characteristics using interchangeable sensors and apply advanced analytics and AI to provide early detection of environmental and nutrient impact conditions. Impacts include the ability to help farmers reduce costs by reducing excess soil additives that leach into nearby waterways and leverage ""connected farms"" to share soil and environmental information. Eagle Eye Imaging, LLC , based in Woodbine, Md., has serviced local growers for over four-years using state-of-the-art drone technology, providing growers with remote sensing plant stress surveys. In collaboration with Willard Agri-Service, it is also developing methods for prescription spraying, creating a more ecologically & sustainable environment. Currently a technology gap exists prohibiting drone precision spot spraying of herbicides and fertilizers. Funds for this project will create technology enabling a tech-empowered workflow from drone scouting, to weed identification and geo-location, to drone spot spraying. This hi-tech value proposition will not only increase the local grower’s margin but will significantly reduce environmental impact. “The ARR Challenge was intentionally set up to push our applicants to reach across county lines and utilize all of the resources that the state has to offer,” said Dr. Arti Santhanam , executive director, TEDCO’s Maryland Innovation Initiative. “The applicants rose to the collaboration challenge admirably with technologies developed in the universities being tested on farms, and farms reaching out to tech providers to upgrade their equipment and infrastructure. We saw technologies ranging from drone surveillance of soil and water quality to energy efficient lighting for aquaponics and reclaiming of old poultry farms for land-based aquaculture!  This provides the funding needed for the applicants to respond to the challenges of COVID and pivot, rebuild and grow in the post COVID economy.” Applications were received from various technology industries, every region of the State, and included a diverse range of applicants. The industry sectors included 47% agtech, 17% food and beverage, 13% biotech, 13% engineering, 7% other and 3% healthcare. The diverse group of applicants were 30% minority and 31% women. “We were excited to see this program come to fruition and the diverse group of applications received from across the State that sought out funding,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall , chief executive officer, TEDCO. “Rural and ag-based businesses experienced a great deal of hardships during this time, and we hope our ARR funding will provide pathways that are necessary and sufficient for an entrepreneur’s success.” For more information, visit https://www.tedcomd.com/agriculture-and-rural-rebuild-arr-challenge . #  #  #","Arti Santhanam, COVID, Kick Robotics, Larry Hogan, Mark Street Aquafarms, Willard Agri-Service","ARR, ARR Challenge, Advanced Analytics/AI, Agriculture, Agtech, Athena Environmental Sciences, CMG, COLUMBIA, Catoctin Mountain Growers, Croppers Farm, Dahlias and Lisianthus, Eagle Eye Imaging, Farmer's Markets, Grateful Gardeners, IMET, JumpLights, LLC, State, TEDCO’s, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, the ARR Challenge"

USM Maryland Momentum Fund Portfolio Company Veralox Therapeutics Announces $16 Million in New Investment | TEDCO,"Wednesday, June 23, 2021",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2021/usm-maryland-momentum-fund-portfolio-company-veralox-therapeutics,,Venture Funds,"Wednesday, June 23, 2021 Frederick Company led by University of Maryland graduate Jeff Strovel shows continued growth after receiving seed funding from Maryland Momentum Fund and other investors in 2019. FREDERICK, Md. – June 23, 2021 – Veralox Therapeutics, a biotechnology company developing small molecule therapeutics to treat the underlying causes of diseases that have significant unmet medical needs, today announced the closing of a new round of funding – a $16 million Series A financing.  Investors in the new financing include Sanofi Ventures, Genesys Capital, Hatteras Venture Partners, JDRF T1D Fund, Point Field Partners, VTC Innovation Fund, University System of Maryland (USM) Momentum Fund, and TEDCO . Maryland Momentum Fund was among the first investors in Veralox with a $500,000 seed funding investment in 2019. “We are very pleased to have the Maryland Momentum Fund as a returning investor,” said Jeffrey Strovel, PhD, chief executive officer of Veralox Therapeutics. “Early on, the Momentum Fund team saw the potential of our unique approach in drug development and the strength of our platform. Their support, which has also included connections to potential partners and strategic counsel, has contributed our success.” In January, Veralox submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial of VLX-1005 for the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a condition that can lead to low platelet counts.  HIT arises from an aberrant immune response to the medication heparin. Currently, one third of hospitalized patients in the U.S., or about 12 million a year, receive heparin for anti-coagulation prior to surgery. The company also announced that VLX-1005 was awarded Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA in this indication. “Veralox’s progress to date is very encouraging,” said Claire Broido Johnson, managing director of the Maryland Momentum Fund. “The company has successfully delivered on its plans thus far and we are pleased to continue our support alongside several other experienced therapeutics investors.” “In the short time since our initial investment in the seed funding round, Veralox has matured into a clinical-stage company,” said Katie Ellias, managing director of the JDRF T1D Fund. “The company’s innovative approach targets a novel pathway to inhibit beta cell stress and has the potential to become a disease modifying therapy for a range of diseases and conditions including type 1 diabetes (T1D). We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Veralox and welcome the new investors to this important effort.” “Veralox is working to solve an important problem in life sciences, and we are happy to play a small part in what is a notoriously long path to market,” said Jack Miner , TEDCO’s chief investment officer. “We also appreciate the role that other investors are playing in Veralox and look forward to seeing the technology advance.” About Veralox Therapeutics VERALOX Therapeutics Inc. ( https://veralox.com/ ) is developing first-in-class therapeutics that target the underlying pathologies of diseases with unmet medical needs. The company’s lead candidate, VLX-1005, will be developed initially to treat patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Second generation therapeutic products are under development for T1D and other immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases. About VLX-1005 VLX-1005 is a first-in-class and selective small molecule inhibitor 12-Lipoxygenase, a key target within the arachidonic acid pathway. Preclinical data has demonstrated that VLX-1005 halts immune driven platelet activation and thrombosis thus offering the potential of a lifesaving treatment for patients with HIT. About the USM Momentum Fund The Maryland Momentum Fund is an initiative of the University System of Maryland (USM) to provide late seed investment funding for promising technology ventures that come out of any of the 12 constituent USM institutions, its research parks, and its students, faculty, or graduates. With a $10M commitment from the USM already in place, the Fund co-invests with venture capitalists, foundations, and angel investors. The Maryland Momentum Fund was established by the USM Board of Regents to support promising commercial opportunities arising from advances in research and intellectual property at USM campuses, and its portfolio companies include: MF Fire , NextStep Robotics , the North American Wave Engine Corporation , Zest Tea , PaverGuide , Retrium , Veralox Therapeutics , Gemstone Biotherapeutics , Neoprogen , Minnowtech , ARMR Systems , Infercabuary , Datakwip , pathOtrak , KaloCyte , N5 Sensors , MiRecule , VisiSonics , Voxy EngGen , Dynamhex , and Qualytics The Fund is designed to create returns and support USM’s most innovative ideas as they enter the marketplace.

(April 20, 2021)— TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today its Seed Fund invested $200K in TargetDocs, a Maryland-based technology startup. TEDCO’s Seed investment is part of an $850K funding round, which includes University System of Maryland Momentum Fund (Momentum Fund), the Hustle Fund, New Age Capital, Debut Capital, Dingman Center Angels, and Gaingels. TargetDocs , based in Montgomery County and led by CEO Joseph Leiva, is a construction communication platform that streamlines project file correspondence between general contractors and all of their subcontractors in one place. After graduating from the A. James Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland, Leiva joined his family’s construction business where he saw firsthand the need for a communication management tool tailored to the construction industry. TargetDocs was developed to help connect subcontractors and general contractors through one catch-all workspace, so that files do not fall through the cracks and projects can be kept on time and on budget. “It is rewarding for all of us in the Maryland innovation ecosystem to see numerous investment groups and innovators come together to support a company like TargetDocs,” said Jack Miner , chief investment officer at TEDCO. “We are one small part in the process and are excited about the prospects for all of the investments in TEDCO's Seed Funds portfolio. TargetDocs is in an interesting space where there are a lot of moving parts that must be completed accurately and on time. We look forward to seeing their progress in the market.” TEDCO’s Seed Fund invests in early-stage, technology and life sciences companies and includes gap financing. The most recent round of funding, $200K to TargetDocs , came from its Cybersecurity Investment Fund.

(April 13, 2021) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today the Maryland Entrepreneur Hub ( The Hub ) launch in collaboration with the Maryland Department of Commerce and the University System of Maryland . The Hub , https://marylandentrepreneurhub.com/, was designed with the entrepreneur in mind, to provide a platform that gathers all of Maryland’s resources and funding information in one place. ""It's so important for entrepreneurs and the entities that support entrepreneurs be connected, especially during COVID-19,” said Claire Broido Johnson of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, managing director of the University System of Maryland's Momentum Fund. “We want to make sure there is a resource connecting providers and suppliers with tools, funding, mentors, space, and more and hope this new platform is really efficient!"" Maryland has a diverse innovation ecosystem filled with various organizations, incubators, accelerators, investment funds, events, and other entities providing valuable support to entrepreneurs. With all of these resources spread out across the State, it becomes difficult for the entrepreneur to find what they need to grow. “Creating a one-stop shop for Maryland’s many resources gives our entrepreneurs a competitive edge when starting or running a business,” said Maryland Commerce Secretary Kelly M. Schulz. “This new platform will allow our entrepreneurs to focus on what they do best, instead of spending valuable time trying to track down funding options or looking for potential partners.” The Hub is intended to address these challenges, providing a comprehensive web-based solution to aggregate tech development resource, asset, and support services information across thousands of websites relevant to our ecosystem. Users will be able to easily explore and locate reliable, up-to-date information on incubators, accelerators, grants and funding opportunities, events, mentoring, and more, based on their specific needs related to their stage of growth, industry sector, founder type, type of business or location. “We all must be more intentional about our efforts to connect the ecosystem to see it grow to its full potential,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall , TEDCO’s CEO and executive director. “Our goal in expanding our support for Maryland’s entrepreneurs is to make the vital pieces of our ecosystem more accessible to continue to drive economic empowerment for the State.” Announced in November 2020 , TEDCO selected EcoMap Technologies to create the AI-enabled platform. EcoMap is a Maryland-based, technology company that leverages AI in order to build robust and scalable databases of assets within entrepreneurial ecosystems.","COVID-19, Claire Broido Johnson, Kelly M.

He begins his tenure with TEDCO on March 1, 2021. “Jack brings many years of venture capital and leadership experience to fill this critical role at TEDCO,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall , TEDCO’s CEO and executive director. “Leveraging his extensive knowledge of the entrepreneurial and venture capital community, we’re looking forward to the impact he will make in fostering TEDCO’s mission to better serve our entrepreneurs.” Photo Credit: 20Fathoms, Northern Michigan's Tech Incubator An experienced entrepreneur, venture creation expert, and economic development specialist, Jack Miner is the new chief investment officer to lead TEDCO’s investment activity through the Builder, Seed and Maryland Venture Funds. “TEDCO and the State of Maryland have done a great job enabling innovation through the Seed, Builder, and Maryland Venture Funds,” stated Jack Miner, chief investment officer, TEDCO. “TEDCO’s work over nearly 23 years created momentum on which it can provide the necessary funding to ‘lead innovation to market’.” Miner was the managing director for Cleveland Clinic Ventures , where he oversaw a team focused on its portfolio companies, and led efforts to spin-off new companies. Miner’s team played a pivotal role in developing funding strategies, technology roadmaps, and business models for its portfolio companies. Prior to Cleveland Clinic Ventures, Miner was the director of the Venture Center at University of Michigan (UM) Tech Transfer . At UM, he launched more than 50 startup companies and worked with a portfolio of more than 300 emerging technologies spanning all industries. Companies from the Tech Transfer portfolio raised billions of dollars over the years, with $700 million in venture capital under his leadership. Prior to this, he had roles within seven different venture capital-backed software companies, where he witnessed the business creation and monetization process of the companies.

TEDCO has leveraged more than $1 billion in follow-on venture capital investment in the portfolio of companies supported and more than 7,800 jobs created at an average salary of $74,700. “While funding is one small part of the innovation process, its absence is a big problem for early-stage companies,” stated Miner. “Having it here in Maryland, is a tool that helps attract and retain the best and brightest and I look forward to helping the team enable the use of this resource. The funding is a real asset that should not be underestimated in its potential impact, and our team will do everything we can to not only be good stewards of the money but ensure that it continues to grow.” “We also want to acknowledge and offer our gratitude to the TEDCO investment team staff and Elizabeth Good Mazhari , our interim managing director, Maryland Venture Fund, whose leadership during this period has set a foundation for TEDCO to flourish in the years to come,” stated LeMaile-Stovall.","Elizabeth Good Mazhari, Jack, Jack Miner, Miner, Photo Credit, Tech Transfer","COLUMBIA, Cleveland Clinic Ventures, Columbia Filling, LeMaile-Stovall, Maryland Venture Fund, Maryland Venture Funds, Tech Incubator, Tech Transfer, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, UM, the State of Maryland, the Venture Center at University of Michigan"

$5M Economic Relief Approved for Maryland Businesses Hit Hardest | TEDCO,"Thursday, December 31, 2020",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2020/5m-economic-relief-approved-maryland-businesses-hit-hardest,,,"Thursday, December 31, 2020 Columbia New State Emergency Funding to be Administered by TEDCO COLUMBIA, Md. (December 31, 2020)— TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, is offering a new economic relief initiative to benefit socially and economically disadvantaged and rural early-stage technology-based businesses hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 17, Governor Larry Hogan announced a state emergency economic relief package that includes $5 million to help socially and economically disadvantaged companies or companies in rural areas negatively affected by COVID-19. The economic relief is available statewide to qualifying companies that demonstrate some adverse impact from the COVID crisis. The announcement from the governor was part of $180 million in additional economic relief contributing to a cumulative total of over $600 million provided by the State to date in emergency economic relief. “The COVID-19 crisis has significant and potentially long-lasting effects on Maryland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall , TEDCO’s CEO and executive director.  “Much of the current recovery efforts are focused on more established small and large businesses. This is rightfully so, as the impact is devasting to many of these entities.  However, this crisis is a ‘make-it-or-break-it’ time for many younger companies, like those in TEDCO’s portfolio.” The funds administered by TEDCO will be provided to early-stage companies that are impacted by the current crisis and are in need of bridge funding to survive and prosper as the downturn and COVID-19 crisis subsides. The funds will focus on companies that have the highest barriers to traditional financing but are still expected to scale to the next phase of fundraising. Startups employ Marylanders, contribute to critical supply chains, and provide valuable revenue to the State and local governments. TEDCO’s portfolio alone consists of over 250 companies that employ over 2,400 Marylanders. TEDCO also assists and guides scores of other entrepreneurs and startup companies and frequently becomes one of the only sources of financing as more traditional forms of capital become scarce. “There is significant evidence to conclude that the COVID-19 crisis is disproportionately affecting entrepreneurs who are socially and economically disadvantaged or those entrepreneurs in the rural regions of the State,” further stated LeMaile-Stovall. “This is attributable to two main reasons: these businesses tend to face underlying issues that make it harder to run and scale successfully, and they are more likely to be concentrated in the industries most immediately affected by the pandemic.” Recent reports from the Center for Responsible Lending have shown that over 90% of small minority owned firms did not receive funds through the federal Paycheck Protection Program. Existing banking relationships play a major role in how likely a business is to apply for, and have success in obtaining, a loan. Many of the smallest businesses have never sought a line of credit and have no relationship with a lender. According to a 2020 Federal Reserve report, 46% of white-owned businesses have obtained loans in the past, while just 23% of black-owned firms have done so.  For rural regions, broadband connectivity issues make working in an all-virtual environment particularly challenging. The funding should be available by early-February 2021. If you are a socially disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged, or a rural-based business in Maryland that has been negatively impacted by the pandemic, more info about the funding will be available soon at https://www.tedcomd.com/rural-and-underserved-business-recovery-impact-covid-19.","COVID, COVID-19, Larry Hogan","COVID-19, Columbia New State Emergency Funding, Federal Reserve, LeMaile-Stovall, Marylanders, Paycheck Protection Program, State, Troy LeMaile-Stovall, the Center for Responsible Lending"

TEDCO Announces Collaboration to Develop AI-Enabled Entrepreneurial Resource | TEDCO,"Monday, November 2, 2020",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2020/tedco-announces-collaboration-develop-ai-enabled-entrepreneurial,,,"Monday, November 2, 2020 Columbia New Online Tool will Benefit Maryland's Innovation Ecosystem COLUMBIA, Md. (November 2, 2020) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today it has selected EcoMap Technologies, Inc . to develop an AI-enabled platform for gathering information about all of Maryland’s entrepreneurial resources and funding information in one place. The State’s ecosystem is filled with various organizations, incubators, accelerators, investment funds, events, and other entities providing valuable support to entrepreneurs. These resources can be difficult to locate at times and, as a result, entrepreneurs can experience difficulty in locating the support they need. In an effort to address this challenge, TEDCO (the Maryland Technology Development Corporation) , the Maryland Department of Commerce and the University System of Maryland are collaborating to implement a new, comprehensive web-based solution that will aggregate tech development resource, asset, and support services information across thousands of websites relevant to our ecosystem. Users will be able to easily explore and locate reliable, up-to-date information on incubators, accelerators, grants and funding opportunities, events, mentoring, and more, based on their specific needs related to their stage of growth, industry sector, founder type, or type of business. “Maryland’s small businesses are an invincible force, constantly needing to pivot and address the daily challenges entrepreneurs face,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall, TEDCO’s CEO and executive director. “Our goal is make Maryland’s business resources more accessible to support our growing ecosystem, and continue to drive economic empowerment throughout the State.” “Creating a one-stop shop for all of Maryland’s many resources helps better equip our entrepreneurs with the tools they need to start or run a business,” said Maryland Commerce Secretary Kelly M. Schulz. “Instead of spending time trying to track down potential funding options or looking for potential partners, this platform will enable entrepreneurs to focus more on doing what they do best.” EcoMap Technologies is a Maryland-based, technology company that leverages AI in order to build robust and scalable databases of assets within entrepreneurial ecosystems. Its technology allows it to customize platforms for cities, states, and countries, and keep all information continually updated. Due to its advanced knowledge of Maryland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem and expertise in building similar platforms for Baltimore, Dallas, Birmingham, Ghana, and others, it was selected for creating the tool for this State-wide effort. ""The University System of Maryland places a high priority on new venture creation, retention and growth.  This platform is essential for our startups and others we hope to support, to best locate the resources they require,"" said Claire Broido Johnson of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, managing director of the University System of Maryland's Momentum Fund.","Claire Broido Johnson, Kelly M.

(September 18, 2020)— TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, received a grant from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to further enhance the organization’s success in stimulating economic growth throughout the state. TEDCO received $125,000 as one of 24 awards granted by the SBA under the Federal and State Technology (FAST) Partnership Program. Along with funding, FAST helps to grow economic development by providing candidates with outreach, training, business assistance and mentoring. The support FAST provides is designed to help research and development focused small businesses compete in the SBIR/STTR Programs—which for 2020 will have more than $4 billion in early-stage seed capital to be awarded to early-stage, high-tech small businesses. Through the support of FAST, TEDCO will be working with the GovCon Incubator of OST Global Solutions, Inc. (OST), and the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) to help small businesses win government Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) seed capital. With the FAST grant, the TEDCO team will be offering the SBIR Proposal Lab developed with the goal of improving proposal quality, submissions, and win rates for SBIRs/STTRs funded in part through a Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Small Business Administration. The SBIR Proposal Lab objective is to double the success rate of the SBIR/STTR applications through a series of training workshops, mentoring, and consulting leading to the SBIR/STTR submission. The SBIR Proposal Lab will target the National Science Foundation SBIR solicitation. There is no specific technology area focus. Rural, women-owned, and socially disadvantaged entrepreneurs that have never won an SBIR/STTR are especially encouraged to apply. “TEDCO is committed to providing a full range of resources and opportunities to Maryland’s diverse and competitive start-up ecosystem,” said Troy LeMaile-Stovall, TEDCO’s CEO and executive director. “This program is an excellent example of a valuable resource that allows us to continue driving economic empowerment throughout the state to support our start-up community.” A cohort of approximately 25 companies will be selected to participate in the SBIR Proposal Lab. The workshops will guide the cohort from SBIR/STTR solicitation issuance through proposal submission. The SBIR Proposal Lab will also provide the cohort the skillset to win with other government and commercial proposals for the businesses’ long-term success. “TEDCO is honored to have been selected to play a significant role in stimulating the entrepreneurial ecosystem,” said Ronald Kaese, director of federal programs. “TEDCO is committed to providing opportunities for Maryland entrepreneurs and looks forward to working with the SBA to promote this important program that will continue to empower small businesses.” The FAST award project and budget provides organizations with one year of funding to assist in implementing statewide programs to increase the number of proposals and awards and prepare awardees for success beyond the program. TEDCO will use the funding to conduct virtual on-line workshops from Rockville, MD, utilizing communications technology to connect the participants. To be awarded, candidates had to be endorsed by their state governor as only one proposal was accepted from each state or territory. Proposals were evaluated by panels of Federal reviewers led by the SBA. ### About TEDCO TEDCO enhances economic development growth through the fostering of an inclusive entrepreneurial innovation ecosystem.

(August 13, 2020)— TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced its recent round of investments in six (6) start-up companies and funding to  fifteen (15) university projects through the Maryland Innovation Initiative (MII). Established in 2012, the MII program was created as a partnership between the State of Maryland and five Maryland academic research institutions: Johns Hopkins University Morgan State University University of Maryland, Baltimore University of Maryland, Baltimore County and University of Maryland, College Park. The program’s mission is to accelerate promising technologies with significant commercial potential to market while leveraging each partner University’s strengths. “MII is focused on our mission to accelerate promising technologies from the lab to the market – be it in health or other consumer markets,” stated Dr. Arti Santhanam, MII executive director. “To this end we are committed to creating start-ups that have a solid technological basis, address a pressing commercial or health need and can create a robust technical ecosystem supporting jobs and economic growth in Maryland.” The fund created and invested $150,000 each in the following six companies through the Company Formation Phase of the program: EpiWatch, Inc., located in Baltimore, is a Johns Hopkins University spinout that has developed a mobile disease management (DM) software application for people with epilepsy (PWE) that runs on a smartwatch and its companion phone. NuMoon Technologies LLC. , located in Columbia, is a University of Maryland, Baltimore County spinout, commercializing innovative detection solutions that enhance the safety and security of military and civilian lives.

(April 3, 2020)— TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today that its Rural Business Innovation Initiative (RBII) made its first $25,000 investment in Omni Biosciences, LLC , a Frederick-based, minority women-owned biotechnology company. Omni Biosciences is focused on developing novel therapeutics for treating skin conditions such as acne and preventing post-surgical infections. In addition, since Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes), is also responsible for surgical infections, the technology has significant commercialization potential for preventing post-surgical infections. According to the American Academy of Dermatology Association, acne tops the list of common skin conditions in the U.S., affecting an estimated 80-90% of teenagers and has been reported as the 8th most common disease affecting approximately 10% of people globally. “TEDCO’s RBII has been mentoring Omni Bioscience for over a year,” said Chuck Ernst, TEDCO RBII mentor. “The company previously received a TEDCO RBII research grant and now has the opportunity to dramatically change how acne is treated in both cosmetic and surgical business sectors.” Founded by Dr. Mina Izadjoo, a serial entrepreneur with over 25 years of experience, she serves as the president and chief science officer leading product development. “TEDCO is filling a critical need for entrepreneurs by creating a comprehensive support system for small biotech companies,” stated Mina Izadjoo, president and chief science officer. “We are fortunate to receive support from various TEDCO programs, particularly from the RBII mentors. We right away felt a sense of belonging in the biotech community and appreciate TEDCO's tireless efforts and support for the innovation culture in the state of Maryland.” TEDCO’s Rural Business Innovation Initiative is designed to enhance technology commercialization and provide technical and business assistance to small and early stage companies in rural Maryland. “TEDCO’s Rural Business Innovation Initiative pre-seed investments have had a successful track record of scaling start-up companies in rural regions of Maryland,” said Anne Balduzzi, TEDCO’s Director of Advisory Services. “Omni Bioscience’s proprietary novel therapeutic, large target market, and the team’s 70 years of combined infectious disease research is a great example of the type of company that, with an early investment, can potentially impact the future economic development of a rural ecosystem.”","Anne Balduzzi, Chuck Ernst, Mina Izadjoo, Omni Bioscience’s, TEDCO’s RBII","Advisory Services, COLUMBIA, LLC, Omni Bioscience, Omni Biosciences, Omni Bioscienes, RBII, Rural Business Innovation Initiative, TEDCO’s Rural Business Innovation Initiative, the American Academy of Dermatology Association"

This, combined with her personal leadership style makes her uniquely qualified to lead TEDCO successfully during this transition period.” In her immediate past role, Linda was a senior advisor to Governor Larry Hogan and a member of his cabinet. As Adjutant General, she was responsible for the daily operations of the Maryland Military Department, which included the Maryland Army National Guard, Maryland Air National Guard, Maryland Emergency Management Agency, and Maryland Defense Force. Linda oversaw the readiness, administration, and training of more than 6,700 members of the Military Department with an annual budget of more than $314 million. Her career included staff and command assignments at every level, including deployments in Kosovo and a combat tour in Afghanistan. Linda also served more than 20 years at Accenture and retired as Managing Director from the firm’s Health and Public Service North America operating unit.

"TEDCO and NIST Award $448,000 Through N-STEP | TEDCO","Tuesday, December 24, 2019",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2019/tedco-and-nist-award-448000-through-n-step,,,"Tuesday, December 24, 2019 Columbia The NIST Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Program (N-STEP) Commercializes NIST Research COLUMBIA, Md. (December 24, 2019)— The Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) and the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced that four companies were awarded a total of $448,000 through the NIST Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Program (N-STEP). Each company was awarded $112,000 to develop its NIST-licensed technology for commercial market applications and to grow its business. ""The N-STEP grants catalyze the growth of new companies, delivering products and services based on technologies invented at NIST,” said Walter G. Copan, Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and NIST Director. “By encouraging talented, entrepreneurial researchers and business leaders, this program is an important part of the NIST innovation pipeline, transitioning exciting new technologies into benefits for the American economy and people.” N-STEP is a collaborative effort between TEDCO and NIST, focused on the commercialization of NIST research. It provides opportunities for researchers previously employed by NIST or who are nearing the end of term employment, who may be interested in forming companies to independently pursue technologies that can be commercialized as products or services to benefit the public. The program makes grants to these companies to move technologies further along the commercialization pathway, increase the company’s value, and lead to follow-on investment and job creation. To date, 10 companies have received N-STEP awards. “NIST and TEDCO designed N-STEP to facilitate the creation of startup companies with NIST technologies by NIST researchers that desire to become entrepreneurs. A key element is that the initial seed funding provides resources to further develop the technology and provides business mentoring and support,” said Ron Kaese, Director of Federal Programs at TEDCO.  “For each NIST technology that is commercialized by a NIST launched company, an innovative technology is brought into the economy to build a sustainable company creating well paying, high-tech jobs.” The four most recent awardees are: PathOtrak, LLC, of Bethesda, Maryland, is developing a technology that reduces the detection time of Salmonella in food from 24 to 36 hours down to 4 hours. This will help food manufacturers save money in warehousing and refrigeration, but more importantly, reduce recalls and avoid outbreaks of foodborne disease. Foodborne pathogenic bacteria inflict great losses in health and the economy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s most recent estimate for the cost of foodborne illness in the United States is more than $15.6 billion annually. Microbial Pulse Diagnostics, LLC, of Golden, Colorado, is developing and deploying an innovative NIST technology for the rapid measurement of antimicrobial susceptibility. This technology “takes the pulse” of bacterial cells, sensing changes in their metabolism, motility, and growth after exposure to an effective antibiotic. Microbial Pulse Diagnostics seeks to build the first deployable prototype to perform on-site testing of urinary tract infection samples at partner clinical laboratories. The delivery of rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing will potentially save tens of thousands of lives and billions of dollars in the U.S. each year. Graphene Waves, LLC, located in Gaithersburg, Maryland, is working to commercialize graphene technologies developed at NIST for the measurement and research markets. Graphene Waves can produce single crystalline, high-quality graphene as large as its substrate that is ready for fabrication without transfer. This leads to an economical graphene quantum Hall resistance (QHR) standard that can be operated in a cryogen-free system, saving enormous expenses. The company is also developing a rapid process for the characterization of large-area graphene and a synthesis method that significantly reduces the cost for multilayer-free epitaxial graphene. These technologies will substantially reduce the calibration traceability chain and provide an affordable QHR standard with high accuracy to a wide range of industrial end-users. It will also provide a variety of attractive graphene products for research markets and applications such as high-performance electronics, photonics, and sensors. Parman Tech, LLC, in Gaithersburg, Maryland, was formed for the sole purpose of commercializing a NIST-owned technology. This N-STEP award is the first step in Parman Tech’s aspiration to become a manufacturer within Maryland. Parman Tech is creating a new laser technology to aid the development and manufacture of biologic pharmaceuticals. Precise, microscopically shaped laser light will replace mechanical filters and other old, coarse technologies used in the detection and analysis of particle contaminants. Improved detection and analysis of sub-visible particles will make biologics safer and more effective in the treatment of some of the most difficult human diseases.

NIST researchers interested in applying for the fund may contact Ronald Kaese, Program Manager, by phone at 410-715-4170 or by email at rkaese@tedco.md . N-STEP awards may not be made to a company owned and/or managed by any person who is a federal employee at the time of the award.","Graphene Waves, Hall, Parman Tech, Parman Tech’s, Ron Kaese, Ronald Kaese, Walter G.

(July 24, 2019) – The Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO), Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced the lineup of thought leaders participating in its new Task Force for Women Entrepreneurs. The task force is dedicated to the recruitment, funding, and operational support of women-owned and-led startups in Maryland. The TEDCO Board of Directors Executive Committee commissioned the task force in conjunction with the TEDCO management team. Myra Norton, Chair of the TEDCO Board of Directors and President and COO of Arena, will lead the task force while Jennifer Hammaker, TEDCO’s Vice President of Business Development, will serve as chief liaison with TEDCO. The group seeks to assess the challenges that women entrepreneurs in Maryland face when accessing capital and implement strategies to overcome those challenges. “I am honored to be a part of this important innovation ecosystem initiative,” said Norton. “One of the main reasons I joined TEDCO’s Board of Directors was to help build a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem. To achieve that aim, we must ensure that women entrepreneurs and women-owned startups in Maryland have equal opportunity to obtain funding and support. This task force is another great step in that direction.” Studies show an industry-wide problem with women-owned companies receiving support from venture capital firms. One study showed that, in 2018, just 10% of all global venture dollars went towards solely women-owned startups. While this is an increase from previous years, it is still significantly less than the 83% of all global venture dollars that went towards men-owned startups that year. Similarly, the percent of global seed dollars in 2018 that went towards women-owned startups was just 6% compared to the 80% received by men-owned startups. “This task force is something that we at TEDCO have been looking to implement for some time,” said Jennifer Hammaker, TEDCO’s Vice President of Business Development. “We have had great success with TEDCO’s Builder Fund, which financially and operationally supports Maryland startups run by entrepreneurs who self-identify as socially or economically disadvantaged, and we are excited to apply the lessons learned there to this task force.” “We also expect that through this initiative we will be able to better assess TEDCO’s internal service delivery operations to ensure the dedicated team is responsive at all levels,” said Tina Williams-Koroma, Vice Chair of TEDCO’s Board of Directors and President and CEO of TCecure. The task force includes the following members: Tina Williams-Koroma , TCecure Lisa Smith , Bowie Business Innovation Center Kyp Sirinakis .

Jeff Cherry , Conscious Venture Lab The task force seeks to identify and implement concrete actions that drive outcomes for women entrepreneurs in the state over the next year. In 2016, TEDCO commissioned a study into the demographics of those startups applying for funding and support from TEDCO to try to identify underserved entrepreneurs. As a result of that study, TEDCO launched the Minority Business Pre-Seed Fund, which eventually became the Builder Fund. The fund received funding for the first time of $1 million in Governor Hogan’s 2020 budget to expand funding for startups run by entrepreneurs who self-identify as socially or economically disadvantaged.","Arena Laura Neuman, Ben Sigel, Entrepreneur Amy Millman, Hogan, Jeff Cherry, Jennifer Hammaker, Julie Lenzer, Mintz Levin Ava Pipitone, Myra Norton, Springboard Enterprises, TCecure Lisa Smith, Tina Williams-Koroma","Bowie Business Innovation Center, Bowie State University, Business Development, COO, Norton, RoosterBio, TCecure, TEDCO Margot Connor, TEDCO’s Board of Directors, TEDCO’s Builder Fund, The Maryland Technology Development Corporation, The TEDCO Board of Directors Executive Committee, University of Maryland, the Builder Fund, the Minority Business Pre-Seed Fund, the TEDCO Board of Directors"

By any measure, George and his team achieved that goal and more. We are sorry to see him go and wish him well in his next endeavor.” “I could not be more proud of what the TEDCO team has accomplished in helping entrepreneurs and start-ups access industry-leading investment services, training and capital, in addition to protecting and growing Maryland investments,” Davis said. “I’m especially proud that TEDCO has begun to make unprecedented strides in helping Maryland’s women and minority entrepreneur communities.” The TEDCO Board of Directors selected Davis as Executive Director and CEO of TEDCO in 2017. TEDCO is Maryland’s innovation, technology transfer and technology investment arm providing entrepreneur and early stage technology businesses with grant and investment capital and advisory services to help them start and grow in Maryland. With more than $135 million in assets under management, the combined platforms that TEDCO administers and manages have helped create hundreds of new companies resulting in valuable economic returns to the state in the form of jobs and revenues. “Under Davis’ leadership TEDCO has achieved many noteworthy accomplishments including the implementation of Gateway Services, a new suite of support programs for entrepreneurs and startups, the establishment of the Builder Fund targeting economically and socially disadvantaged entrepreneurs and a significantly enhanced investment portfolio that includes sustainable, growth oriented technology businesses contributing significant economic returns to the State,” said Chairman Smyth.

(April 25, 2019) —The Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO), Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today the second round of startups receiving funding and support through TEDCO’s Pre-Seed Builder Fund (the Builder Fund). In addition to funding, the three companies selected for a Builder Fund investment will also receive executive management support to best position them to receive follow-on investment within 12-to-18 months. “ScholarMe, remodelmate, and EliteGamingLIVE are model, diversified investments for the Builder Fund,” said Angela Singleton, co-manager of the Builder Fund. “These companies are poised to grow fast and tap into big markets with unique product offerings that are disruptive. Each presents an opportunity to advance TEDCO’s core mission of expanding the pool of diverse companies and innovative ideas that will make a lasting, economic impact in Maryland.” The Builder Fund was created to financially and operationally support the development of Maryland startup companies run by entrepreneurs who demonstrate a socially or economically disadvantaged background that hinders access to traditional forms of capital and executive networks at the pre-seed stage. The Builder Fund differentiates itself by identifying exceptional investment opportunities in markets that are often overlooked by traditional funding organizations, by advancing the development of those opportunities, and by making valuable introductions that can lead to the next stage of investment. “The Builder Fund program includes education, team building, access to highly successful executive mentorship, and a pre-seed investment that can substitute for the conventional friends and family round that some startups enjoy,” said McKeever (Mac) Conwell, co-manager of the Builder Fund. “Because of the Builder Fund, Maryland is able to invest in high-quality companies that historically have a more challenging time securing funding, while simultaneously growing our statewide entrepreneurial ecosystem.” The recipients of the Builder Fund’s second round of funding are: ScholarMe , of Howard County guides students through the maze of college financing options with an all-in-one college financing website — with touch points at scholarships, student loans, and government aid. Remodelmate , of Prince George’s County, is a tech-enabled real estate company that provides an online marketplace for buying, selling, and managing home renovation services. Through remodelmate, homeowners can hire pre-screened, highly-rated local contractors with pre-negotiated rates. EliteGamingLIVE , of Baltimore, is an eSports platform that blends technological education with interscholastic, competitive gaming. K-12 students represent their respective schools in competition and complete learning engagements related to their interests. Participants earn opportunities to compete at regional championships where they can win cash, scholarships, medals and trophies. “The growth and success of the Builder Fund has been one of the many TEDCO achievements we are most proud of,” said George Davis, CEO of TEDCO. “Opportunities like these three companies are the reason the Builder Fund made it into Governor Larry Hogan's proposed 2020 budget for first-time funding of $1 million to expand investments for startups run by entrepreneurs from socially or economically disadvantaged backgrounds.” Eligible Builder Fund recipients must have founders who can demonstrate a lack of access to conventional funding due to a socially or economically disadvantaged status. Companies should welcome active involvement from TEDCO’s network of outsourced executives and are required to have at least one founding manager working in the company on a full-time basis.

(March 6, 2019) — The Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO), Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced today the findings of an independent economic impact study detailing the economic development contributions of TEDCO’s five core programs to the state of Maryland. Conducted by Richard Clinch of the University of Baltimore’s Jacob France Institute and Mitch Horowitz of TEConomy Partners (JFI-TEConomy), the study found that TEDCO is a significant economic driving force, supporting 7,746 Maryland jobs and more than $1.6 billion in statewide economic activity in 2018. The study says TEDCO has generated significant economic and fiscal returns to the state. Reviewing the change from 2015 to 2018, TEDCO’s economic impact included job creations from 4,358 in 2015 to 7,746 in 2018. TEDCO’s total economic impact has also seen a significant increase from $1B in 2015 to $1.6B in 2018. The jobs supported by these companies earn $600.1 million in labor income and generate estimated state and local government revenues of $66.6 million, according to the study. By 2023, the study projects TEDCO’s economic impact will increase substantially to $2.4B and will support a total of 11,812 jobs. See the study “This study shows that, since 2015, TEDCO has delivered dramatic and measurable results in our mission of helping to bring economic development and jobs to Maryland,” said TEDCO CEO George Davis. “I am proud of the central role TEDCO plays in supporting entrepreneurs and businesses across the state.” This growth is in part associated with an ever-growing and maturing portfolio of companies supported by TEDCO and the addition of the Maryland Venture Fund and BioMaryland Center portfolio companies, which came to TEDCO in 2015. Other programs under the TEDCO umbrella include the Seed Investments Fund, the Minority Business Pre-seed Fund, the Maryland Innovation Initiative, and the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund. The Seed Investments Fund consists of the following: Technology Commercialization Fund Life Sciences Investment Fund Cybersecurity Investment Fund and Gap Fund. “We also looked at the cost of TEDCO’s work to the state of Maryland and found that TEDCO’s estimated FY2018 state government revenue contribution was $37.6 million, which is over double the state funding appropriation for TEDCO for that same year,” said Mitch Horowitz, the TEConomy Partners economist who co-authored the study. “In just three years, TEDCO’s economic impacts from its core programs increased by 60 percent, while jobs created rose more than 77 percent since 2015,” said TEDCO Board of Directors Chairman Francis Smyth. “Entrepreneurs of all backgrounds and from across the state have benefited from TEDCO’s support and investment, and we are looking forward to continuing this momentum through the expansion of programs this year to focus on women and minority entrepreneurs.” This announcement comes on the heels of TEDCO’s creation of a Task Force for Women Entrepreneurs, which will be dedicated to the recruitment, funding, and operational support of women-owned and-led startups in Maryland, a traditionally underserved entrepreneur population.","Francis Smyth, George Davis, Mitch Horowitz, Richard Clinch, TEDCO","BioMaryland Center, Gap Fund, JFI-TEConomy, TEConomy Partners, TEDCO Board of Directors, Technology Commercialization Fund Life Sciences Investment Fund Cybersecurity Investment Fund, The Maryland Technology Development Corporation, a Task Force for Women Entrepreneurs, the Maryland Innovation Initiative, the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund, the Maryland Venture Fund, the Minority Business Pre-seed Fund, the Seed Investments Fund, the University of Baltimore’s Jacob France Institute"

TEDCO Creates Task Force to Support Women Entrepreneurs in Maryland | TEDCO,"Friday, February 22, 2019",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2019/tedco-creates-task-force-support-women-entrepreneurs-maryland,,,"Friday, February 22, 2019 Columbia Columbia, Md., February 22, 2019 — The Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) announced today the formation of the Task Force for Women Entrepreneurs. The task force will be dedicated to the recruitment, funding, and operational support of women-owned and-led startups in Maryland. The TEDCO Board of Directors Executive Committee commissioned the task force in conjunction with the TEDCO management team. Myra Norton, Vice Chair of the TEDCO Board of Directors and President and COO of Arena, will lead the task force. Jennifer Hammaker , TEDCO’s Vice President of Business Development, will serve as chief liaison between TEDCO and the task force. The task force will assess and analyze the challenges that women entrepreneurs in Maryland face when accessing seed capital and ways to overcome those challenges. The task force will deliver a report to the TEDCO Board of Directors with its findings and recommendations. “I am honored to be a part of this important TEDCO initiative,” said Norton. “One of the main reasons I joined TEDCO’s Board of Directors was to ensure that women entrepreneurs and women-owned startups in Maryland have equal opportunity to obtain funding and support. The task force is another great step in that direction.” Studies show an industry-wide problem with women-owned companies receiving support from venture capital firms. One study showed that, in 2018, just 10% of all global venture dollars went towards solely women-owned startups. While this is an increase from previous years, it is still significantly less than the 83% of all global venture dollars that went towards men-owned startups that year. Similarly, the percent of global seed dollars in 2018 that went towards women-owned startups was just 6% compared to the 80% received by men-owned startups. “This task force is something that we at TEDCO have been looking to implement for some time,” said George Davis, CEO of TEDCO. “We have had great success with TEDCO’s Builder Fund , which financially and operationally supports startups run by entrepreneurs from socially or economically disadvantaged backgrounds, and we are excited to apply the lessons learned there to this task force. Our goal will be the eventual creation of a similar fund geared towards female-owned startups. Additionally, we expect that through this initiative we will be able to better assess our internal service delivery operations to ensure we are responsive at all levels”. In 2016, TEDCO commissioned a study into the demographics of those startups applying for funding and support from TEDCO to try to identify underserved entrepreneurs. As a result of that study, TEDCO launched the Minority Business Pre-Seed Fund, which eventually became the Builder Fund. That fund is in Governor Larry Hogan's proposed 2020 budget for first-time funding of $1 million to expand funding for startups run by entrepreneurs from socially or economically disadvantaged backgrounds.","George Davis, Jennifer Hammaker, Larry Hogan's, Myra Norton","Business Development, COO, Norton, TEDCO’s Board of Directors, TEDCO’s Builder Fund, The Maryland Technology Development Corporation, The TEDCO Board of Directors Executive Committee, the Builder Fund, the Minority Business Pre-Seed Fund, the TEDCO Board of Directors, the Task Force for Women Entrepreneurs"

(December 3, 2018) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announces its recent round of startups receiving funding and executive management support through the organization’s Pre-Seed Builder Fund . Companies selected for a Builder Fund investment also receive executive-level support to best position them to receive follow-on investment within 12-to-18 months. “With TEDCO’s commitment to capturing the full range of opportunities from a diverse and competitive start-up ecosystem, we’re continuing to see high-quality and fundable companies leverage resources and build connections across all parts of the state through the Builder Fund,” said George Davis, CEO of TEDCO. The Builder Fund program financially and operationally supports the development of start-up companies run by entrepreneurs who demonstrate a socially or economically disadvantaged background. Funding is awarded to exceptional investment opportunities in markets that are often overlooked by traditional funding organizations, by advancing the development of those opportunities and making valuable introductions that can lead to the next stage of investment. The program supports TEDCO’s overall mission of discovering, investing in, and helping to build great Maryland-based companies that grow and last. “We’re doing something never done before by leveraging the strategic pairing of highly successful executives with company founders to provide executive management support, talent acquisition, and pre-seed investment that will undoubtedly yield operational success,” said Angela Singleton, co-manager of the Builder Fund. “Our recent group of companies represents TEDCO’s mission of expanding the pool of diverse companies and innovative ideas that will make a lasting impact beyond our state.” Participants in the Builder Fund’s 2018 cohort are: eMedical Sentry , of Rockville, is a provider of telehealth solutions for organizations serving at-risk populations. The company provides a remote patient monitoring service for 30 days post-discharge, which offers the capability of at-home monitoring to improve patient outcomes and reduce the overall cost of healthcare. (Pictured: Steven Myers, President/Founder of eMedical Sentry) Game ChangeHer , of Ellicott City, is a sports and entertainment mobile app that generates sports trivia to fans of opposing teams during live sporting events. (Pictured: H. Taylor Walls, Founder of Game ChangeHer) MileMarker (EduMD, LLC), of Baltimore City, is a medical training assessment tool that helps surgeons in residence and medical schools overcome the challenges stemming from documenting and assessing a resident’s operative experiences.

The tool allows subcontractors to record daily contract work progress, which provides data needed to generate various reports including workforce data, EEO statistics, schedule of value quantities and certified payrolls. (Pictured: Joseph Leiva, CEO of ProTrakr) “Our team of experienced executives don’t just mentor or advise companies they roll up their sleeves and actually work with teams to help them grow. It’s not often a start-up founder can have an experienced COO go to sales meetings or an experienced CMO advise on marketing collateral,” said McKeever (Mac) Conwell, co-manager of the Builder Fund. “The Builder Fund positions TEDCO as a market leader in the nation, by investing in startups and growing an entrepreneurial ecosystem.” Eligible Builder Fund recipients must have founders who can demonstrate a lack of access to conventional funding due to a socially or economically disadvantaged status. Companies should welcome active involvement from TEDCO’s network of outsourced executives and are required to have at least one founding manager working in the company on a full-time basis.

Over that past five years, MII has invested $29 million in project grants and investments and created 77 start-ups, which have in turn raised over $200 million in follow-on funding and created more than 80 Maryland-based jobs. Additionally, the program helped secure 5 exits—most notably the success of Harpoon Medical and Analytical Informatics. As start-up companies join TEDCO’s MII program, they are provided with a range of resources—from mentors and roundtables, to loaned executives. They receive the assistance and support they need as they move through team building, balancing the funding elements and negotiating deals. “Through our recent appointments to the MII program’s Board of Directors, we will build on the successes of the past six years and aim to accelerate technology transfer-based economic development for the State of Maryland,” said Dr. Arti Santhanam, MII program director. “MII was created to commercialize promising technologies through the creation of new ventures, and the Board’s level of expertise and leadership reflect the commitment of our partner institutions to this core mission.” For more details on eligibility and application requirements, please visit: https://www.tedcomd.com/funding/tech-transfer/maryland-innovation-initiative.","Arti Santhanam, Jane Shaab, Julie Lenzer, Karl Steiner, MII, Mary Beth Tung, May, Renee, Renee Winsky, Robert Hallenbeck, Thomas V.

(September 26, 2018) — TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, received a grant from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to further enhance the organization’s success in stimulating economic growth throughout the state. TEDCO received $125,000 as one of 24 awards granted by the SBA under the Federal and State Technology (FAST) Partnership Program. Along with funding, FAST helps to grow economic development by providing candidates with outreach, training, business assistance and mentoring. The support FAST provides is designed to help research and development focused small businesses compete in the SBIR/STTR Programs—which provide more than $2.5 billion in early stage seed capital each year with nearly 160,000 awards to small businesses each year. Through the support of FAST, TEDCO will be working with the GovCon Incubator of OST Global Solutions, Inc. (OST), Eastern Shore Entrepreneur Center (ESEC), and the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) to help small businesses win government Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) seed capital. With the FAST grant the TEDCO team will be offering a new SBIR Proposal Lab developed with the goal of improving proposal quality, submissions, and win rates for SBIRs/STTRs Funded in part through a Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Small Business Administration. The SBIR Proposal Lab objective is to double the success rate of the SBIR/STTR applications through a series of training workshops, mentoring, and consulting leading to the SBIR/STTR submission. The SBIR Proposal Lab will target the Department of Defense and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration SBIR solicitations to be issued this Fall. There is no specific technology area focus. Women and Socially Disadvantaged entrepreneurs submitting for an SBIR/STTR for the first time are especially encouraged to participate. A cohort of approximately 30 companies will be selected to participate in the SBIR Proposal Lab. The workshops will guide the cohort from SBIR/STTR solicitation issuance through proposal submission. The SBIR Proposal Lab will also provide the cohort the skillset to win with other government and commercial proposals for the businesses’ long-term success. “TEDCO is honored to have been selected to play a significant role in stimulating the entrepreneurial ecosystem,” said Ronald Kaese, Director of Federal Programs. “TEDCO is committed to providing opportunities for Maryland entrepreneurs and looks forward to working with the SBA to promote important programs that will continue to empower small businesses.” The FAST award project and budget provides organizations with one year of funding to assist in implementing statewide programs to increase the number of proposals and awards and prepare awardees for success beyond the program. TEDCO will use the funding to conduct simultaneous workshops from both Rockville and Salisbury, MD, utilizing communications technology to connect the participants. To be awarded, candidates had to be endorsed by their state governor as only one proposal was accepted from each state or territory. Proposals were evaluated by panels of reviewers from SBA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Special Operations Command, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, the Missile Defense Agency and the National Institutes of Health.

The technology addresses two significant societal needs: managing environmentally damaging pollution from excess poultry farm litter and generating energy (both electricity and heat) from renewable resources.  The technology represents a significant value proposition to individual poultry farmers, by ridding them of waste, creating electricity for operations, and providing heat for poultry houses. The technology also offers an environmentally friendly solution to the State’s environmental issues related to poultry waste. “It is exciting to receive this grant from the NSF,” said Rob Meissner, CEO Cykloburn Technologies.  “Not only will the funds help us further the development of the technology, but the NSF’s detailed technical and business review and subsequent award decision confirms that the value we see for the technology addresses a significant environmental concern while improving farmer’s profitability.” The company previously received a $150,000 investment from TEDCO’s Maryland Innovation Initiative (MII) to help commercialize the innovation.  In addition, the University, in partnership with the company, was awarded a $100,000 Maryland Industrial Partnerships (MIPS) Program grant supported by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to further develop the CykloBurnHeating System for use in poultry houses. “We invested in Cykloburn because of the smart and high-tech solution they bring to our environmental problems. The fact that this is both a cleantech and an energy tech company that will potentially have direct economic development impact on our farming community in Maryland is icing on top!”, says TEDCO MII Director, Arti Santhanam. About Cykloburn Technologies, LLC: Founded in 2017, Cykloburn Technologies is a Baltimore City-based startup focused on commercializing an innovative poultry waste to energy technology licensed from Morgan State University.  The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Technology Commercialization Ventures LLC a Maryland company formed to license and commercialize intellectual property from Federal and University research institutions.   Since forming Cykloburn, TCV partners Doug Zeisel and Rob Meissner have raised nearly $500,000 for additional research and commercialization from TEDCO (MII Phase II), the MTECH MIPS program, and now the National Science Foundation SBIR grant.","Arti Santhanam, Doug Zeisel, Rob Meissner, Seong Lee","Cykloburn, Cykloburn Technologies, DNR, Federal and University, MIPS, Maryland Innovation Initiative, Morgan State University, NSF, National Science Foundation, State, TCV, TEDCO’s, Technology Commercialization Ventures, University, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the National Science Foundation SBIR"
TEDCO’s Rural Business Innovation Initiative Announces Pre-Seed Investment in Electric Vehicle Developer | TEDCO,"Tuesday, June 19, 2018",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2018/tedcos-rural-business-innovation-initiative-announces-pre-seed,,Rural Business Innovation Initiative,"Tuesday, June 19, 2018 Baltimore TEDCO’s Rural Business Innovation Initiative (RBI2) announced its latest pre-seed investment in HopFlyt, Inc.—a company that has developed an aerodynamically advanced electric vehicle. HopFlyt is the third rural-based company to receive a $25,000 investment from TEDCO’s program. As a recipient, the company will be provided with ongoing mentoring and funding to aid in the advancement of commuter transportation. “TEDCO’s support is critical to help jumpstart our move into the transportation marketplace,” said Rob Winston, CEO of HopFlyt. “With the program’s effective mentorship—both financially and operationally—we’ll be able to continue our mission of providing faster, safer and more reliable urban transportation in Maryland and beyond.” HopFlyt, based in Lusby, Md., is building the Venturi—an aerodynamically advanced electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicle that transports urban commuters. Using a canard style design, the vehicle reduces travel times, improves travel safety and eliminates pollution. According to the 2016 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey & Maryland State Highway Administration: Americans spend an average of 276 hours every year commuting to and from work. Maryland drivers spend 47.9 million hours every year waiting in traffic, wasting 22.6 million gallons of gasoline and costing $2 billion. Annually, the economic cost is tens of billions of dollars in lost productivity, resulting in hundreds of millions of gallons of wasted gasoline and needless exhaust pollution. The HopFlyt Venturi is a piloted aircraft that allows passengers to travel up to five times faster than ground-based transportation methods. It takes off vertically and makes use of the third dimension, flying over urban traffic congestion, and lands vertically at your destination. “This company is at the cutting edge of life and technology that will enhance the quality of life in our state and across the country,” said Tiffany Davis, RBI2 Mentor. “Through its collaborative innovation and environmental awareness, HopFlyt is an excellent representation of the kinds of companies we’re committed to help flourish throughout the state—seeking solutions, challenging boundaries and revolutionizing technology.” TEDCO’s RBI2 program is designed to provide technical and business assistance to small companies and early stage technology-based companies in rural Maryland. The goal of the program is to help companies overcome business and technical hurdles and advance to the next growth level. There is no cost to the company to receive assistance. In May and June of 2018, TEDCO announced its first and second pre-seed investments in Plum Dragon and PaverGuide, respectively. Eligible recipients work with highly trained, highly-experienced mentors who provide technical and business assistance. Eligible companies must be developing new technologies to create or expand their business, have fewer than 16 employees and have annual revenues of $1 million or less.","Rob Winston, Tiffany Davis","American Community Survey & Maryland State Highway Administration, HopFlyt, PaverGuide, RBI2 Mentor, The HopFlyt Venturi, U.S. Census Bureau, Venturi, Vertical Takeoff and Landing"

The program includes education, team building and a pre-seed investment that seeks to institutionalize the conventional friends and family round to fill a gap in access to capital commonly experienced by entrepreneurs from socially or economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The program will also serve to expand Maryland’s pool of high-quality, fundable companies. “This fund is taking businesses with a strong growth potential and using their connections to the investment community to identify the most exceptional opportunities out there,” said Mac Conwell, Builder Fund Program Co-Manager. “The start-up ecosystem is highly competitive, and the Builder Fund is focused on implementing and supporting the best path for each company—both financially and operationally.” Companies receiving up to a $50,000 investment must participate in a formal program, which consists of an investment, a 12-week educational intensive, a second 12-week operational intensive and progress checks at specific intervals post investment. Eligible recipients must have founders who can demonstrate a socially or economically disadvantaged status and must have a principal place of business in Maryland. Companies should welcome active involvement from TEDCO’s network of outsourced executives and are required to have at least one founding manager working in the company on a full-time basis. Deadline for applications is July 15th.

TEDCO’s Rural Business Innovation Initiative Announces Second Pre-Seed Investment | TEDCO,"Thursday, June 7, 2018",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2018/tedcos-rural-business-innovation-initiative-announces-second-pre,,,"Thursday, June 7, 2018 Baltimore TEDCO’s Rural Business Innovation Initiative (RBI2) announced its latest pre-seed investment in PaverGuide, Inc.—a structural base for paving systems designed to advance permeable pavements. PaverGuide is the second rural-based company to receive a $25,000 investment from TEDCO’s program. As a recipient, the company will be provided with ongoing mentoring and funding to continue developing a clean rainwater reservoir and expansive infiltration system. “This opportunity shows the organization’s commitment to growing and supporting innovation throughout Maryland, while allowing us to build and expand green infrastructure through pre-seed funding and professional mentorship,” said (Pictured from left to right) PaverGuide CEO Charles, White RBI2 Mentor Bill Bernard Charles White, CEO of PaverGuide. “As we expand our services across the U.S. and grow our operations, TEDCO’s investment—both in resources and funding—are critical to ensuring efficient, effective and quality water control.” PaverGuide, Inc. developed and sells a storm water infiltration chamber that replaces stone as a road base and reservoir below permeable pavements. The product is a structural base for paving systems, manufactured from recycled plastic. It can be installed faster and cheaper than the stone it replaces—and at 90% void, it provides a massive rainwater reservoir and expansive infiltration surface. PaverGuide allows for increased productivity and profitability, and expansion of clean, green and professional materials. The company is also developing a stormwater filtration media at the University of Maryland. The research is funded by Maryland DNR and the Maryland Industrial Partnership. “This company is a great testament to the ingenuity and problem-solving acumen that will have a major, lasting impact beyond our state lines,” said Bill Bernard, RBI2 Mentor. “With a successful road since its inception, PaverGuide is posed to grab hold of significant share in the green infrastructure and water infiltration markets.” (Pictured from left to right) PaverGuide CEO Charles, White RBI2 Mentor Bill Bernard TEDCO’s RBI2 program is designed to provide technical and business assistance to small companies and early-stage technology-based companies in rural Maryland. The goal of the program is to help companies overcome business and technical hurdles and advance to the next growth level. There is no cost to the company to receive assistance. In May 2018, TEDCO announced its first pre-seed investment in Plum Dragon. The Chester-based company manufactures and sells a line of 100% herbal and natural topical analgesics for trauma injury and pain such as tendonitis, bruising, sprains, strains, fractures, muscle and connective tissue injuries. Eligible recipients work with highly trained, highly-experienced mentors who provide technical and business assistance. Eligible companies must be developing new technologies to create or expand their business, have fewer than 16 employees and have annual revenues of $1 million or less.

Solomons Inventor and Entrepreneur Takes First Place at Crab Pot Pitch Contest | TEDCO,"Monday, May 21, 2018",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2018/solomons-inventor-and-entrepreneur-takes-first-place-crab-pot-pitch,,,"Monday, May 21, 2018 Frederick The Southern Maryland Innovation and Technology (SMIT) meetup and PaxSpace announced Lowell Cade, Founder of RYG Light LLC, as the first place winner of the Crab Pot Pitch Contest.  Cade received a $5,000 cash prize to further his concept, a bushel of crabs, and a one-year membership to PaxSpace, a member-operated makerspace where entrepreneurs can work on their projects. “Mr. Cade and his fellow competitors at the Crab Pot Pitch Contest are setting the bar higher for all entrepreneurs,” commented Kelly Robertson-Slagle, director of the Calvert County Department of Economic Development. “Ground-breaking technologies, new solutions to old problems and cutting-edge inventions helped shape the American economy watching these creative ideas come to fruition right here in Southern Maryland is very exciting for all of us.” Lowell Cade’s invention of the RYG Light, a portable, handheld device is used to control pedestrian and auto traffic.  Last week, his patented device won first place in the Southern Maryland Innovation and Tech (SMIT) Initiative finals of the 4th annual Crab Pot Pitch Contest. Five products were pitched in the finals which ranged from an electric vertical take-off flying car and a convertible rescue boat/bookcase to a river filtration product and a constant-motion knee brace which aids in physical therapy exercises invented by a team of high school students from St. Mary’s County. “From the beginning stages of business, marketing and cash flow planning, technology commercialization to future production and manufacturing, the SBDC and the Maryland Technology Development Corp. (TEDCO) has assisted RYG Light since last summer,” stated Wynne Briscoe, Small Business Development Center consultant. “Along with pitch deck development and rehearsals, mentoring, confidence building and attending vital business meetings with vendor and stakeholders, we have been with Lowell every step of the way.” Crab Pot is a uniquely Southern Maryland pitch contest for inventors and entrepreneurs. Made popular by television shows like ABC’s “Shark Tank,” pitch contests provide an opportunity for entrepreneurs to present their ideas to a panel of judges or investors in front of an audience. Crab Pot also provides a venue for the community to celebrate the efforts of local entrepreneurs and innovators. “The room at the Calvert Marine Museum was packed and the competition was very solid,” stated Cade. “I’ve been working on this product for quite some time and have received a lot of support and feedback along the way. I was thrilled to be selected as the Crab Pot winner. It further validates my concept and demonstrates that people understand it and appreciate the need for it.” Cade was driving home from work in a snowstorm late one evening and noticed a police officer attempting to control traffic in zero visibility conditions. Barely able to see the officer in the roadway, he wondered if there could be a safer way to conduct traffic – and the RYG Light was conceived. Final improvements are currently being made to the product prior to commencement of full-scale manufacturing. Cade envisions applications for the device in emergency management, public safety, construction, school crosswalk activities and general pedestrian management. He intends to finalize design elements and begin production, in Maryland, within a year. For more information on RYG Light, visit www.ryglight.com. “SMIT and the various partners who support it have played an active role in Crab Pot over the last 4 years and it is incredible to see how it has grown,” stated Southern Maryland Innovation and Technology coordinator Adam Mawyer. “Events like Crab Pot, which celebrate and promote new ideas and businesses, are essential to our mission to grow the entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystem in Southern Maryland.” The Crab Pot Pitch contest is organized and sponsored by PaxSpace, Inc.

The company then applied for TEDCO’s mdPACE program, where it will receive assistance and funding to navigate and graduate the commercialization process. With TEDCO’s backing, BondTrue has entered the critical prototype development stage—which will be used for multiple purposes including product trials, animation development and investor/partner communications. “TEDCO brings a depth of medical device product development experience and commercialization acumen that will be critical to bringing BondTrue to market. We’re eager to move through the stage-gate process with TEDCO’s executive-level guidance so that we can accelerate the regulatory pathway for the BondTrue device, which has massive market potential for numerous types of surgeries including orthopedic and cardiothoracic procedures,” said Aimee Martin, CEO of BondTrue.

TEDCO Accepts ClearMask into mdPACE Program | TEDCO,"Monday, March 5, 2018",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2018/tedco-accepts-clearmask-mdpace-program,,,"Monday, March 5, 2018 Baltimore TEDCO, Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, inducts ClearMask into its mdPACE program to assist in bringing its life-changing innovation to market. Baltimore-based, ClearMask LLC is the developer of the country’s first, full-face transparent surgical mask designed to help healthcare entities reduce medical errors caused by miscommunication and provide a better experience for deaf patients and other patient groups who heavily rely on visual cues, including children, limited English proficiency patients, and immunosuppressed patients who cannot see the smiles of their loved ones and care team. As part of the mdPACE program, ClearMask has access to TEDCO’s expertise and resources to efficiently navigate the FDA regulatory process and generate a 510(k) cleared technology within 12-18 months. The experienced team provides an intimate focus and collaborative spirit to support the medical device startup in bringing to market a product that will save the state millions in avoidable malpractice costs, reduce medical errors caused by miscommunication, support disability compliance and ultimately provide better health outcomes through better patient-provider communication. “Getting through FDA clearance is a daunting and costly milestone that every medical device company must clear. It’s comprised of many things, from developing quality management systems to optimizing manufacturing strategies and distribution. Partnering with TEDCO’s mdPACE will be a critical key to our success and will allow us to create a sustainable product that can bring long-term economic impact and growth to Maryland,” said Allysa Dittmar, ClearMask’s president. “Being a part of TEDCO provides us incredible opportunities to meet and collaborate with other entrepreneurs and entities experienced in this process and help us have a greater impact on the community.” The ClearMask, developed in Baltimore, is the first of its kind medical device. The full-face, anti-fog transparent window enables lip-reading and full visual communication with facial expressions, while also being more comfortable and breathable than standard and semi-transparent surgical masks. The mask will help reduce miscommunication, a factor in 80 percent of medical errors, resulting in $1.7 billion in malpractice costs. “Innovations like the ClearMask represent the next generation of medical device entrepreneurs, those with seasoned guidance, that are poised to attract investment, hire employees, and generate revenue,” said Neil Davis, TEDCO’s Director of Entrepreneurial Development. “Overall we’re excited about the outcomes of the program and the increased flow of FDA-cleared devices from the Central Maryland region in the coming years. Successfully cleared technology will heighten the visibility among investors and manufacturers—both in Maryland and around the country— that will increase its sustainability.” mdPACE is jointly funded by TEDCO and the U.S. Department of Commerce, under the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) i6 Grant, to help medical device companies like the ClearMask efficiently navigate the FDA regulatory process. The goal of the program investments is to create additional indirect and non-scientific jobs in the region, bringing with it the associated economic development benefits. “This program is at the core of TEDCO’s mission to nurture and fuel a successful entrepreneurial ecosystem here in Maryland,” said George Davis, TEDCO’s CEO. “We’re invested in growing technology and businesses that will have a major impact on our economy—and further establish this region as a hub for medical device innovation and commercialization.” In 2016 mdPACE received $500,000 from the EDA and a $500,00 cash match from TEDCO. Since then, 18 companies have been accepted into the program. Companies previously funded through mdPACE include: Coaptech, GrekTek, Infinite BioMedical, Innurvation, Linshom, Multisensor Diagnostics, Sisu Global Health and Sonavex. “Efficiently navigating the FDA clearance process is a potential bottleneck for any young medical device company,” stated Coaptech co-founder and CEO Howard Carolan.  “TEDCO has created a high-value program that is really making a difference.” TEDCO accepts applications on a rolling basis. Eligible companies should be coachable and have secured some funding, either diluted or non-diluted. Ideally, the team will have been through a successful FDA pre-submission meeting. Interested entrepreneurs begin with the Request for Application. About ClearMask The ClearMask’s patent-pending, full-face transparent surgical mask makes healthcare more human by facilitating whole-face communication and more compassionate, inclusive connections that reduce patient anxiety and costly medical errors from miscommunication while improving patient satisfaction and cultural competency. The ClearMask was born following a 2015 adverse surgical experience with the company’s Deaf co-founder, Allysa Dittmar. Having relied heavily on sign language, lip-reading, and visual cues, Allysa was unable to communicate with medical staff in the operating room where everyone was wearing standard surgical face masks. Allysa was unable to see expressions, lip-read, or even a reassuring smile because of the masks. In critical health environments, she and many other deaf and hard of hearing patients are often unable to communicate with their providers because of the masks, and experience poorer health outcomes than their hearing peers.

"Impact Study: Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund Awards $140 Million in Support of Research Projects, Generates 1,400 Maryland Jobs | TEDCO","Tuesday, December 19, 2017",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2017/impact-study-maryland-stem-cell-research-fund-awards-140-million,,Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund,"Tuesday, December 19, 2017 Baltimore TEDCO , Maryland’s economic engine for technology companies, announced the findings of an economic impact study detailing the contributions of the state’s Stem Cell Research Fund (MSCRF). Conducted by the Sage Policy Group, Inc., the study found that MSCRF is a significant economic driving force, creating nearly 1,400 jobs and has supported more than $286 million in statewide economic activity over its ten-year lifespan. According to the study, MSCRF generated more than $57 million in employee compensation and 1,400 jobs (of which 500 are direct jobs)* since its 2007 inception. For each $1 invested through grant funding, $2 in economic value for the state is created. In 2017 alone, the MSCRF funded $9.1 million for research, including grants to universities, hospitals and private companies. To date, more than $140 million has been awarded in support of over 400 Maryland-based research projects. “Maryland’s Stem Cell Research Fund is addressing a critical need to seed the state’s innovation ecosystem with great researchers, impactful analysis, and promising therapies,” said George Davis, CEO of Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO), which commissioned the 2017 impact study. Maryland now ranks as the sixth market in the U.S. for life sciences, in large part due to the enactment of the Maryland Stem Cell Research Act of 2006, according to JLL. This ranking looks at the competitive landscape of the life sciences industry and measures growth, funding and employment. “Last year we launched a new initiative, Accelerating Cures, aimed to support innovation and discovery, and help new ideas mature and transition into commercial products and cures in the marketplace,” said Dr. Dan Gincel, Executive Director of MSCRF. “In a short time, we have identified, helped and funded more than 13 new technologies from Universities in the state and have created a community of 50 companies in the cell therapy, stem cell or regenerative medicine field.” A year ago, 37.3 percent of MSCRF awards – a total of $2.7 million — went to private companies, up from 13.4 percent in 2016 and 6.2 percent in 2007. And that number is projected to go to as high as 60 percent in the coming years. The dramatic change in award distribution, to include more private firms, points to a greater diversity in the pursuit to commercialize life science innovation. In addition to supporting research, MSCRF provides fellowship training grants for post-doctoral trainees at Maryland’s world-class universities. Over the last 9 years of the post-doctoral program, the fund has contributed to attracting and retaining many of the nation’s top researchers — with more than 65% of fellows continuing to work in Maryland universities and companies. “I am proud of the great promise we hold here in Maryland – any of these grantees advancing to market will not only momentously impact our economy, it will also improve life for individuals and families impacted by disease,” said Dr. David Mosser, chairman of the Maryland Stem Cell Research Commission.” MSCRF is currently accepting applications for a variety of grant programs supporting human stem cell research and commercialization. Deadline for fiscal year 2018 funding applications is January 18, 2018. For more information and to apply, visit: http://www.mscrf.org. The MSCRF serves to promote state-funded stem cell research and cures through grants and loans to public and private entities located throughout Maryland. While economic development represents a cornerstone objective of the MSCRF, the ultimate goal is to improve the human experience through the development of new medical strategies that utilize human stem cells for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases and conditions.","Accelerating Cures, Baltimore TEDCO, Dan Gincel, David Mosser, George Davis, JLL, MSCRF","MSCRF, Maryland Technology Development Corporation, Stem Cell Research Fund, the Maryland Stem Cell Research Act, the Maryland Stem Cell Research Commission, the Sage Policy Group, Inc."

MBPF is a pilot program for African-American entrepreneurs in Maryland. “These minority-founded businesses represent the audacious ideas that make Maryland such a thriving technology ecosystem,” said George Davis, CEO of TEDCO. “MBPF is competitive, and only the best ideas supported by a thoughtful commercialization plan receive an investment – these awardees are among the best of the best.” “The Harbor Bank of Maryland Community Development Corporation’s investment into these companies represents our commitment to supporting the best ideas and entrepreneurs in the region.  We know that catalytic investment is vital to the growth of the local economy,” said John Lewis, Executive Vice President of The Harbor Bank of Maryland CDC. The winning businesses for the MBPF current round are: kweliTV, PYT Funds Inc., and PyroDex LLC. kweliTV , based in Silver Spring, is an interactive streaming platform that shares the African Diaspora experience through high-quality content (independent film, news, web shows, kids programming, documentaries) produced by globally diverse and unique filmmakers and journalists who aim to share their stories and truths with the world.

Through the process of assessing alternative data with social vouching and cash, PYT is able to work with the lender to leverage a lender loan approval. The cash raised in the process will ultimately reduce the student’s debt balance.

TEDCO Portfolio Company Signs Licensing Agreement with Lizard Skins | TEDCO,"Tuesday, October 31, 2017",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2017/tedco-portfolio-company-signs-licensing-agreement-lizard-skins,,,"Tuesday, October 31, 2017 Baltimore Grip Boost Inc., a Baltimore-based TEDCO portfolio company, announced that Lizard Skins became the exclusive worldwide distributor of the Grip Boost Batting Gel. Grip Boost’s patent-pending gel technology was invented at the University of Maryland and commercialized through seed funding support provided by TEDCO’s Maryland Innovation Initiative (MII) and Technology Commercialization Fund (TCF). The Grip Boost gel was invented to restore grip to football gloves a reformulated version of the product was later released to address the unique needs of baseball and softball players. The Grip Boost Batting Gel is a quick drying, alcohol-based gel that gives batters the extra grip and superior bat control they need without the mess of traditional grip enhancers such as pine-tar. The Grip Boost Batting Gel works by applying a thin, tacky polymer layer to the palm of the glove. It’s clear, easy to clean and doesn’t leave residue.

"TEDCO awards $125,000 to six teams to bring new incubation ideas to life | TEDCO","Wednesday, October 25, 2017",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2017/tedco-awards-125000-six-teams-bring-new-incubation-ideas-life,,,"Wednesday, October 25, 2017 Baltimore From the Baltimore Business Journal: After seeing the strength of the six finalist projects and evaluating each of the teams’ proposals, TEDCO board members decided to up their $300,000 offer, and fund every one of them. Maryland Technology Development Corp. awarded $750,000 to six teams who submitted proposals for new kinds of startup incubation methods that could be used in Maryland. They will use the money to bring those ideas to life. What started as a $300,000 incentive and an open call for ideas on new methods to help support and grow local startups, beyond the resources already available, yielded 51 proposals submitted to TEDCO. This incubation challenge was launched in June and promised to fund up to two innovative ideas. TEDCO narrowed the pool of proposals down to 16, then six. All six teams delivered their final pitches Wednesday, during TEDCO’s annual Entrepreneur Expo. John Wasilisin, president of TEDCO, said after seeing the strength of the teams and evaluating each of their unique proposals, board members decided to up the offer, to fund every one of them. “Our goal was to get some disruptive new ideas in the mix, and de-risk them, by giving them the money they needed to jump start these great ideas,” Wasilisin said. “We want to see if we can really move the bar for startups in Maryland.” The six finalist projects will each receive $125,000. The winning teams, collectively made up of about 21 collaborating organizations, are to use the funds to support the launch and first year of operation of their incubation ideas. Here are the new projects being brought to Maryland: TrajectoryNext (Betamore, UM Ventures, the Grid, FastForward, Johns Hopkins Tech Ventures and University of Maryland, Baltimore): A new post-accelerator program will offer startups support and assistance as they work to build up their teams and acquire new customers. The program is designed to serve startups that are navigating the tricky period after graduating from an accelerator or incubator and losing that outside support system. ( Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute , Inncuvate Consulting, Bowie Business Innovation Center, Maryland Intellectual Property and Legal Resource Center, Prince George’s Community College and Northrop Grumman): This project focuses on creating innovation connections between entrepreneurs and corporate entities. During four-week cohorts, entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to develop solutions for specific problems identified by local corporations, ensuring guaranteed customers. FounderTrac (Launch! Annapolis, MCVC partners, Annapolis Ventures and Maryland Tech Council): A 12-week accelerator program helps connect startups with industry mentors and also brings in in-house venture funding opportunities to help startups move their businesses forward. This program has already been launched and recently graduated its first cohort. It will be expanded in the coming years, with extra funding. ( Eastern Shore Entrepreneurship Center‘s F³ Tech Program and Bethesda’s BeGreen Hub): This project focuses on building bridges and collaboration opportunities between rural and urban entrepreneurs. There will be quarterly symposiums that allow for representatives from different rural/urban industries to discuss the biggest problems facing their businesses, and challenge events that allow entrepreneurs to try and tackle those problems. Anchor Ventures (Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures, UM Ventures and University System of Maryland): This project builds on a ‘venture cafe’ model that has worked in other states, and includes monthly meet up events — same time and day each month — where startups and entrepreneurs can network, collaborate, engage with guest speakers and mentors and mingle with venture capitalists in a relaxed environment. The program will be piloted in Baltimore, with hopes to expand it to other parts of the state as well. The LaunchPort Accelerator (MVR Co. and the Quinn Group): A new accelerator based in City Garage is geared toward medical device firms. It is being launched through a partnership between Engineered Medical Systems Inc., and Indianapolis-based medical products manufacturer, and local advisory firm the MVR Co. The program will give growing companies the opportunity to establish residency in a new manufacturing facility, called the Factory, as firms develop their technologies, seek regulatory approval, engage in trials and work toward commercialization.","Annapolis, Baltimore, John Wasilisin, Wasilisin","Anchor Ventures, Annapolis Ventures, Bethesda’s BeGreen Hub, Bowie Business Innovation Center, Engineered Medical Systems Inc., FastForward, F³ Tech Program, Inncuvate Consulting, Johns Hopkins Tech Ventures, Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures, Legal Resource Center, MVR Co., Maryland Tech Council, Maryland Technology Development Corp., Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute, Northrop Grumman, Prince George’s Community College, TEDCO, UM Ventures, UM Ventures and University System, University of Maryland, the Baltimore Business Journal: After, the MVR Co., the Quinn Group"

TEDCO Announces New Gap Funding for Startup Companies | TEDCO,"Thursday, April 20, 2017",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2017/tedco-announces-new-gap-funding-startup-companies,,,"Thursday, April 20, 2017 Columbia The Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) today announced $1 million in new economic development funds that will provide startup technology companies with investment capital to help cover the gap between seed funding and venture capital investments. The Gap Investment Fund program, which was included in Governor Larry Hogan’s Fiscal Year 2018 budget, is being developed and administered by TEDCO. “Technology startups often face funding challenges, particularly the critical period between receiving seed funding and being a mature enough company to attract venture capital,” said Governor Hogan. “This new program will bridge that funding gap, giving technology startups a much-needed lifeline as well as incentive to stay and grow in Maryland.” TEDCO’s Seed Investment programs support approximately 50 companies per year – creating a funnel of companies that serve as a source of deal flow for the new Gap Investment Fund initiative. A Seed Investment of $100,000 can support a project that advances a technology toward commercialization. TEDCO’s later-stage fund, the Maryland Venture Fund, and other venture capital funds support companies further along in their development – often with significant revenues and complete management teams – that are raising investment rounds of more than $2 million. This established structure leaves a significant funding gap between the state’s seed investments and the investments made by institutional investors, such as venture capitalists. “To help ensure that companies started in Maryland stay in Maryland, resources were needed to address the financing needs of growing companies, especially those that had already received investment through one of the State’s seed investment programs but are still vulnerable to leaving the State to receive their next round of funding,” said Newt Fowler, TEDCO Board Chair and business transactions partner of Womble Carlyle, LLP. “The Governor has provided a critical tool for building one of the nation’s leading technology clusters and TEDCO, which sees many of these companies at the seed investment stage, is well-equipped to administer the funding.” TEDCO will now provide gap funding up to $500,000 to Maryland-based, technology companies to hire new employees for expansionary efforts such as scaling a product across markets and increasing market reach. These new funds must be used to hire additional employees and must be matched by other investments in the company. “Startups generally require funding for their move from validating products to establishing a toe-hold in the market and generating revenues.  This activity often falls in the gap between seed and venture investment, which usually requires a company to have revenues,” said John Wasilisin, president and chief operating officer of TEDCO. “TEDCO’s goal is to bridge this funding gap and help build successful companies to spur economic development in Maryland.”","Hogan, John Wasilisin, Larry Hogan’s, Newt Fowler, TEDCO, TEDCO’s Seed Investment","Gap Investment Fund, State, TEDCO Board Chair, The Gap Investment Fund, The Maryland Technology Development Corporation, Womble Carlyle, the Maryland Venture Fund"

TEDCO and startups funded by TEDCO’s Maryland Innovation Initiative (MII) were recipients of AUTM awards at the national meeting held in Hollywood, Florida. Stephen Auvil, TEDCO’s Senior Vice President for Technology Transfer and Commercialization, received AUTM’s Service Award and Volunteer of the Year Award. The latter accolade is awarded annually by AUTM and recognizes leadership and outstanding contributions to the association. “It is wonderful to be able to contribute to AUTM, which provides so much support to the technology transfer profession all over the world,” stated Stephen Auvil. “It is also humbling to be recognized among the many talented people that volunteer to support AUTM’s various programs and activities.” “TEDCO’s mission is to facilitate the creation of tech businesses and foster their growth across Maryland through the commercialization of technology,” stated TEDCO President John Wasilisin. “We, at TEDCO, are pleased to see Stephen’s contributions to the tech transfer community recognized at a national event by his peers, and are proud to have him in a leadership role at TEDCO.” Another component of the annual meeting was the Pitch and Play – the AUTM Venture Challenge, where academic-affiliated startup companies pitch their business opportunity to a panel of seasoned venture investors for a $10,000 cash prize. Four Maryland companies reached the stage of final presentations at the AUTM conference, with LifeSprout named the winner. All of the startups hailed from either Johns Hopkins University (JHU) or the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP) and have received funding from TEDCO’s MII program: Grip Boost produces a quick-drying gel that is applied to athletic gloves to increase tackiness. Grip Boost’s original product was marketed towards football, but they have since expanded to golf and baseball. TEDCO invested $200,000, across two programs, in the company. The intellectual property was licensed from UMCP. LifeSprout, which was the winner of the competition, is developing soft tissue filler that can be utilized in plastic surgery techniques such a breast reconstruction. LifeSprout’s technology offers more natural soft tissue restoration with superior biointegration when compared to current products on the market. MII invested $115,000 for technology validation. The intellectual property was licensed from JHU. PathoVax is developing a vaccine for human papillomavirus(HPV).  Unlike current HPV vaccines, PathoVax’s technology would protect against all HPV strains that are known to cause cancer. MII invested $100,000 for technology validation. The intellectual property was licensed from JHU. MouthLab is developing a medical device to monitor patients at home with chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure. MouthLab will rapidly take a patient’s vitals from one source (the mouth) and report this data in real time to the patient’s healthcare providers. MII invested $100,000 for technology validation. The intellectual property was licensed from JHU. “With four MII companies in the finals, and one winner, this demonstrates that great things happen when the universities, faculty entrepreneurs and economic development work together,” stated Jennifer Hammaker, Maryland Innovation Initiative Director at TEDCO. “A lot of groups, including Tech Transfer, Site Miners, Reviewers, and Advisors have supported these teams, and to the credit of the entrepreneurs, they have executed on their plan and are doing the hard work every day to make it happen.” MII was created as a partnership between the State of Maryland and five Maryland academic research institutions (Johns Hopkins University, Morgan State University, University of Maryland College Park, University of Maryland Baltimore and University of Maryland Baltimore County.) The program is designed to promote commercialization of research conducted in the partnership universities and leverage each institution’s strengths. AUTM is a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing research to life by supporting and enhancing the global academic technology transfer profession through education, professional development, partnering and advocacy. AUTM’s more than 3,200 members represent managers of intellectual property from more than 300 universities, research institutions and teaching hospitals around the world as well as numerous businesses and government organizations.","David Winwood, Grip Boost, Grip Boost’s, Jennifer Hammaker, John Wasilisin, MII, Stephen Auvil, Stephen’s, Tech Transfer, Volunteer","AUTM, AUTM Board of Directors, AUTM’s Service Award, COLUMBIA, HPV, JHU, Johns Hopkins University, LifeSprout, MII, Maryland Innovation Initiative, Morgan State University, PathoVax, Reviewers, TEDCO’s, The Maryland Technology Development Corporation, University of Maryland Baltimore, University of Maryland Baltimore County, University of Maryland College Park,, the Association of University Technology Managers, the University of Maryland College Park"

TEDCO and Harbor Bank CDC Pilot New Minority Pre-Seed Fund for Tech Entrepreneurs | TEDCO,"Wednesday, February 15, 2017",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2017/tedco-and-harbor-bank-cdc-pilot-new-minority-pre-seed-fund-tech,,,"Wednesday, February 15, 2017 Columbia The Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) and The Harbor Bank of Maryland Community Development Corporation (HBCDC) announced today the launch of a pilot program, the Minority Business Pre-Seed Fund (MBPF). The MBPF will provide pre-seed capital and mentorship to underrepresented tech entrepreneurs in Maryland. “The Minority Business Pre-Seed Fund is designed to be TEDCO’s initial attempt to grow entrepreneurship in underrepresented communities with the goal of fueling innovation and economic development in Maryland,” stated TEDCO President and COO John Wasilisin. “By partnering with Harbor Bank, a top-rated African-American-owned financial institution whose mission aligns with the MBPF, TEDCO’s initial effort is aimed to broaden the resources available to African-American tech entrepreneurs.” TEDCO’s mission is to facilitate the creation of tech businesses and foster their growth throughout the State through the commercialization of technology. Nationally known as more than a seed/early-stage funding and support resource, TEDCO has invested in more than 400 seed investments over 14 years through 8 funding and 6 mentoring and education programs. TEDCO’s $22 million awarded to start-ups resulted in $1 billion follow-on funding. Harbor Bank started in 1982 with a mission to serve the urban market, and in particular African-Americans who were disproportionately rejected by majority institutions. Even today, a study conducted by TEDCO in 2016 indicates the African-American community lacks access to early pre-seed funds, traditionally known as the “friends and family round.” The MBPF pilot program will provide 10 African-American entrepreneurs with up to $40,000 each to test initial business assumptions and build a prototype. “This pre-seed funding partnership with TEDCO is a continuation of Harbor Bank’s work to address an unmet need in the community. Nearly 35 years ago, The Harbor Bank of Maryland was founded to address the need for access to capital and financial services in Greater Baltimore,” stated Joseph Haskins Jr, Chairman, President and CEO of the Harbor Bankshares Corporation.  “We continue to be innovative in our support of small businesses and entrepreneurs to drive economic development in the state.” The Harbor Bank of Maryland Community Development Corporation’s recent showcase of African-American technology companies led to approximately one million dollars in early-stage commitments for the firms involved. HBCDC is also developing a co-working space at its Baltimore headquarters to support underserved entrepreneurs. MBPF information sessions are scheduled for February 22, 2017 at TEDCO in Columbia and March 1, 2017 at The Harbor Bank of Maryland’s 25 West Fayette Street branch in Baltimore from 5-6:30 p.m. TEDCO plans to begin accepting applications for the MBPF program on March 1, 2017.  Fund investment terms and conditions can be found online at www.tedco.md/program/minority-business-pre-seed-fund-mbpf.  For more information about TEDCO and HBCDC’s Minority Business Pre-Seed Fund, contact McKeever Conwell at mconwell@tedco.md, 410-715-4180 or Calvin Young at cyoung@theharborbank.com, 443-923-0534.","Calvin Young, John Wasilisin, Joseph Haskins Jr, McKeever Conwell","HBCDC, HBCDC’s Minority Business Pre-Seed Fund, Harbor Bank, Harbor Bank’s, MBPF, State, The Harbor Bank of Maryland, The Harbor Bank of Maryland Community Development Corporation, The Harbor Bank of Maryland Community Development Corporation’s, The Maryland Technology Development Corporation, The Minority Business Pre-Seed Fund, the Harbor Bankshares Corporation, the Minority Business Pre-Seed Fund"

The two companies, who were evaluated by a review panel consisting of FDA consultants, investors, and C-level biotechnology and life science executives, and others, are: SAJE Pharma, of Baltimore, Md., has developed a new therapy for the treatment of patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILD), specifically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Their orally bioavailable compounds reverse existing fibrosis which is a novel and highly significant finding. The goals of the LSIF project are to take the compound to the next stage of its development — initial safety and pharmacology studies that will determine whether it is safe enough to begin human clinical trials and for FDA approval. Promaxo, Inc. , of Rockville, Md., is a medical device company developing and commercializing an office-based, portable MRI with cellular level spatial resolution and real-time biopsy and treatment tools. Their patented MR technology takes advantage of proprietary ultra-fast and strong rise-and fall gradients and pre-polarization fields, which can be switched on rapidly without causing bio- effects (e.g., nerve stimulation). Promaxo’s MR platform technology is protected by 17 issued and pending patents and has successfully undergone a 26-patient safety trial. LSIF funds will be used in finalizing the clinical prototype, and performing phantom and animal validation studies for FDA 510K submission.“These ‘lifescience/biohealth’ start-ups face a long runway to commercialization, requiring multiple investment rounds based on critical product development success,” stated LSIF Manager, Dr. Arti Santhanam.  “The TEDCO investments will help these companies bridge the gap to FDA approval while improving their company valuation to help raise capital from sophisticated investors. In fact, two of our current portfolio companies have already successfully raised follow-on capital.” LSIF makes investments of up to $200,000 for a period of one year to support milestone-based projects that advance their medical product toward commercialization. Investments are made in the form of a five-year, convertible note to the company. TEDCO plans to make 5 – 6 investments per year and applications are accepted on a rolling basis.  Fund investment terms and conditions can be found online here .

Maryland Innovation Initiative Fuels Launch of Successful Startups from State’s Research Universities | TEDCO,"Monday, September 19, 2016",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2016/maryland-innovation-initiative-fuels-launch-successful-startups,Sonavex,Maryland Innovation Initiative,"Monday, September 19, 2016 Columbia TEDCO announced today its Maryland Innovation Initiative (MII) program has awarded $18 million to more than 180 commercialization projects and 45 start-up companies since its inception in late 2012. Awards were given across a variety of industries, including therapeutic, software, medical devices and engineering. “MII is the only program in Maryland that supports the transition of technology from the academic research laboratory through product development to commercialization in a start-up company,” says John Wasilisin, President and COO. “The program has been a game changer for innovators at Maryland’s research universities to take the next step in becoming entrepreneurs.” MII-funded start-up companies have been successful in getting follow-on funding – totaling $21 million from federal funds, angel investors and venture capital firms. Some of the latest examples include Longeviti – developer of CAD/CAM, laser, and robotic technology, licensed from Johns Hopkins University,  to assist in craniofacial surgery.  The company closed a $2 million Series A in July 2016 and attracted executives from a Fortune 500 company. MF Fire – developer of the Catalyst Stove, the first ultra-clean wood stove – emitting less smoke than a single cigarette, licensed from University of Maryland, College Park. The company recently raised $185,000 through the SEC’s new regulated CrowdFunding provision. Sonavex – developer of the EchoSure/EchoMark system, licensed from Johns Hopkins University that detects clots during surgeries earlier and more reliably than existing modalities. The company received more than $1 million from TEDCO’s Life Sciences Investment Fund and NSF, and currently is raising a Series A round. “After almost four years of investments, the exciting part is seeing these early technologies and teams move out from the lab, attract talent and close on seed capital investment,” says Jennifer Hammaker, Director of the Maryland Innovation Initiative. “That is a heavy lift and takes the full coordinated effort of our university partners, Site Miners and TEDCO to make it happen. It demonstrates that there are talented faculty and students who are embracing the entrepreneurial culture and doing the hard work necessary to commercialize.” As MII-funded companies become part of TEDCO’s portfolio, they also get to take advantage of TEDCO’s wide array of resources. From mentors and roundtables to loaned executives, the companies receive the assistance and support they need as they move through team building, balancing the funding element and negotiating deals. “We are extremely honored to be a part of this business collaboration with Johns Hopkins, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and the MII,” says Jesse Christopher, CEO of Longeviti. “From Longeviti’s infancy, our Chief Surgical Officer and Founder Chad Gordon leveraged his relationship with MII to accomplish a Phase 1 effort – the development of leading edge software that will create increased successes in the surgical arena.  After a lightning-speed start-up, Longeviti has raised $2 million in funding, published a variety of medical articles, attracted top executives from several Fortune 500 companies, created new jobs, and has established several Longeviti offices in and around Baltimore.” The MII program funnels deals to TEDCO’s later stage funding programs like its Technology Commercialization Fund and Life Sciences Investment Fund. MII has been garnering attention from the angel and venture community by providing them a “first-look” at more than 180 innovative technologies coming out of top research universities in Maryland. The Maryland Innovation Initiative (MII) program was created as a partnership between the State of Maryland, five Maryland academic research institutions (Johns Hopkins University, Morgan State University, University of Maryland College Park, University of Maryland Baltimore and University of Maryland Baltimore County) and TEDCO. With $5.6 million in annual funding, MII is designed to promote commercialization of research conducted in these Universities through the creation of start-up companies.

TEDCO Awards Z-senz With First N-STEP Grant | TEDCO,"Tuesday, April 26, 2016",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2016/tedco-awards-z-senz-first-n-step-grant,,,"Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Columbia The Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced today that Z-senz LLC is awarded with the first NIST Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Program (N-STEP) grant. Z-senz, a Gaithersburg, MD-based company received $112,000 to develop resonant light detection and ranging (R-LIDAR) electronics for small unmanned aerial vehicles. “The N-STEP program was created to encourage entrepreneurship among motivated NIST researchers and grow new companies around the NIST facilities. ,” said John Wasilisin, president and chief operating officer of TEDCO.  “The program grants will support commercialization of innovative technologies from NIST and help build sustainable companies that will create jobs, including near the NIST main campus.” “This program is an important part of our efforts to ensure technology is transferred from federal labs to the marketplace,” said Willie E. May, Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and NIST director. “Many talented researchers spend time at NIST and we want to encourage them to apply what they’ve learned or developed here to create thriving technology-based businesses.” N-STEP, launched last November in collaboration with TEDCO and NIST, is focused on the commercialization of research that has been performed by NIST researchers who may be interested in forming companies to independently pursue technologies that can be commercialized as products or services to benefit the public. The program makes grants to these companies to move technologies further along the commercialization pathway, increase the company’s value, and lead to follow-on investment and job creation. Z-senz’ technology, resonant light detection and ranging (R-LIDAR) distance sensing enables high performance, miniature, and low cost distance sensing useful for applications such as surveying, construction, defense, and robotic and autonomous systems. The optical technique used in the R-LIDAR system differs from techniques used in state-of-the-art systems (e.g., beam scanning and “flash” LIDARs), allowing for different and superior instrumentation attributes including low cost, high performance, and low size, weight, and power consumption. Customer interviews indicate that these attributes have particular value for distance sensors used in small-unmanned aerial vehicles (S-UAVs). The N-STEP grant will allow Z-senz to miniaturize R-LIDAR electronics instrumentation for these applications, a necessary development step to move R-LIDAR technology from the optical lab towards real-world commercialization. “This award from N-STEP is a critical infusion of funds toward our on-going development and commercialization activities,” said Chris Brown, co-founder of Z-senz. “In addition to seed funding, TEDCO is providing access to its Executive Coaches and allowing us to network with Maryland’s entrepreneurial community.” N-STEP program general guidelines and Request-for-Applications (RFA) can be found on the TEDCO website. Entrepreneurs interested in applying for the fund may contact Ron Kaese, Program Manager, by phone at 410-715-4170 or by email at rkaese@tedco.md.","Chris Brown, John Wasilisin, Ron Kaese, Willie E.

The LSIF program helps to move products along this pathway by making investments that will enable companies to reach critical milestones early in their product development efforts, to increase the company’s valuation, and to better position the company for follow-on investment, product commercialization, and job creation. TEDCO invests up to $200,000 for a period of 1 year through the LSIF program to support milestone-based projects. The LSIF program requires a minimum 50% match, in the form of cash, for each TEDCO dollar invested. The selected companies will be eligible to use the $25,000 grant from DED towards the required 50% cash match on the first installment of the TEDCO investment. Montgomery Companies that are not selected for an LSIF investment but whose application is reviewed as highly qualified, could also receive a $25,000 grant from DED toward improving their valuation or product development for a further submission to the LSIF program. Applications for LSIF investment can be submitted to TEDCO two times each year. Application deadlines for 2016 are 5:00 pm on Friday, April 15th and Friday, October 14th.",,"Columbia Montgomery County Department of Economic Development, DED, DED’s Life Sciences IMPACT Grant Program, FDA, LSIF, LSIG, Maryland Technology Development Corporation, Montgomery Companies, TEDCO’s Life Sciences Investment Fund, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration"

Applications For TEDCO’S Life Science Investment Fund Now Being Accepted | TEDCO,"Tuesday, February 23, 2016",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2016/applications-tedcos-life-science-investment-fund-now-being-accepted,,Seed Funds,"Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Columbia Applications for the Maryland Technology Development Corporation’s (TEDCO) Life Science Investment Fund are being accepted now through April 15. The Life Science Investment Fund (LSIF) was previously managed by the former Department of Business and Economic Development under the name Biotechnology Commercialization Award. It was one of the programs that was transferred to TEDCO on October 1, 2015 along with Maryland Venture Fund, following the enactment of legislation passed during the 2015 General Assembly. This legislation was initiated by the Augustine Commission in an attempt to consolidate the State’s efforts to provide seed/early-stage business investment. Under TEDCO’s management, the LSIF has been redesigned to specifically meet the needs of Maryland companies which are developing products that address human health concerns and require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for commercialization. “While Maryland has a robust technology start-up ecosystem, companies developing products which require FDA approval are burdened with long, complicated commercialization pathways that require multiple investments over a long period of time,” says John Wasilisin, TEDCO’s President and Chief Operating Officer. “We believe our LSIF will enable these companies to reach critical milestones early in their product development efforts and will better position themselves for product commercialization and job creation.” TEDCO will make investments of up to $200,000 for a period of one year to support milestone-based projects that advance a medical product toward commercialization. TEDCO plans to make 5 – 6 Investments per year, or 2 – 3 in each of two review cycles. “Getting FDA clearance is an important milestone for startups in life sciences industry helping them with increased valuation,” says Arti Santhanam, LSIF Program Manager. “LSIF is designed to help these companies meet this challenge more quickly and efficiently, acting as a bridge fund to move them up to the next stage.” Investments are made in the form of a five-year, convertible note to the company. Interest will accrue on the note at a rate of 8% per annum. In addition, the LSIF requires a minimum 50% cash match for each TEDCO dollar invested. There are three main eligibility requirements for a LSIF investment: The company must be a for-profit entity located in Maryland with fewer than 16 full-time employees It is either pre-revenue or has received less than an aggregate of $1 million in equity investments from accredited investors and It must be developing a product addressing human health that requires FDA approval through the New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologic License Application (BLA) pathway (such as drugs, vaccines, or biologics) or  a Class II or Class III medical device requiring approval through the 510(k) or Pre-Market Approval pathways (such as medical devices, diagnostics, etc.). The program is specifically designed for companies that are beyond the technology validation stage and further along in product development. For that reason, it is expected that the applicant has initiated preliminary discussions with the FDA. Applications for LSIF investment can only be submitted twice each year. Application deadlines for 2016 are 5 p.m. on Friday, April 15 and Friday, October 14. Prior to submitting an application, companies are encouraged to review “Request for Applications” on TEDCO’s website.

TEDCO Announces New Developments in Executive Exchange Program | TEDCO,"Monday, July 6, 2015",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2015/tedco-announces-new-developments-executive-exchange-program,,,"Monday, July 6, 2015 Columbia In its first year the Program now impacts over 50 Maryland start-up companies every month. COLUMBIA, MD (July 6, 2015) – The Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) announced today the placement of four Loaned Executives and the establishment of the fourth Executive Roundtable through its Executive Exchange Program. In its first nine months the program is already impacting a total of 55 companies and 57 entrepreneurs. “The interest in Executive Exchange within the TEDCO portfolio continues to be very intense,” said Rob Rosenbaum, President and Executive Director of TEDCO. “We’re now convinced that by filling significant gaps in the State’s entrepreneurial assistance ecosystem we’re able to make a meaningful and measurable impact on some of Maryland’s most promising young start-up companies.” Specific developments in TEDCO’s Executive Exchange Program are as follows: Analytical Informatics, the recipient of Maryland Innovation Initiative (MII) Phase 3 funding and creator of a revolutionary data management tool for health care, is receiving the assistance of a TEDCO Loaned Executive. Clear Guide Medical, the recipient of Technology Commercialization Fund (TCF) support and developer of Computer-Assisted Image Guidance (CAIG) for needle-based interventions, is receiving the assistance of a TEDCO Loaned Executive. VitusVet, also the recipient of a TCF investment and developer of an EMR/PHR solution for veterinary medicine, is receiving the assistance of a TEDCO Loaned Executive. Strajillion, one of the 1st start-ups to receive Cybersecurity Investment Fund (CIF) support and provider of a cloud-based management tool for parents raising kids in the mobile + social world, is receiving the assistance of a TEDCO Loaned Executive. Protenus, also one of the 1st recipients of a CIF investment and developer of technology that helps hospitals protect patient data, is receiving the assistance of a TEDCO Executive Coach. A professionally facilitated executive roundtable focused on HealthIT start-ups is now active. “Participating in the TEDCO Executive Exchange program was an exciting step forward”, said Chris Meenan, co-Founder and CEO of Analytical Informatics Inc. “Having an experienced business executive that can provide insight and new ideas in key areas such as business strategy or financial modeling is extremely valuable, giving our start-up exactly the kind of helpful advice we needed at the perfect time for our growth. In the long-term, TEDCO’s new Program will be a critical factor in our success” Executive Exchange is a multi-layered initiative designed to cut across all TEDCO funding programs by offering supplemental stage-appropriate assistance to portfolio and, in some cases, potential portfolio entrepreneurs and their companies. TEDCO hopes to impact as many as 80 additional startup ventures with this new Program in its first year. Initially, the net new elements of Executive Exchange – Loaned Executive, Executive Coaching, and CEO Roundtables – will be directed at TEDCO Technology Commercialization Fund and Maryland Innovation Initiative portfolio companies. Candidates should express their interest in participating through their TEDCO portfolio manager or RBI² representative.","Chris Meenan, Rob Rosenbaum, Roundtables","Analytical Informatics Inc., CAIG, CIF, COLUMBIA, Clear Guide Medical, Computer-Assisted Image Guidance, Cybersecurity Investment Fund, Executive Exchange, Executive Exchange Program, Loaned, Loaned Executive, Maryland Innovation Initiative, Program, State, TCF, TEDCO Executive Exchange, TEDCO Technology Commercialization Fund, TEDCO’s Executive Exchange Program, Technology Commercialization Fund, The Maryland Technology Development Corporation, VitusVet, ” Executive Exchange"

Request for Applications Medical Device Executives for mdPACE Program | TEDCO,"Wednesday, July 1, 2015",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2015/request-applications-medical-device-executives-mdpace-program,,,"Wednesday, July 1, 2015 Columbia Statement of Purpose: The Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) is seeking individuals with appropriate medical device product development and commercialization experience (“Medical Device Executives”) to lead and support early-stage commercialization efforts for university-based, medical device technologies as part of the mdPACE program. The mdPACE program (the “Program”) is a virtual commercialization center that is being created by TEDCO with support from the Department of Commerce and the Economic Development Administration (EDA) through an i6 Challenge grant . The Program will leverage (i) the innovations in medical devices emerging from the Central Maryland/Baltimore/Washington Metropolitan region’s prominent medical and engineering schools including the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University, and (ii) the region’s significant entrepreneurial support infrastructure, to significantly increase the number of successful medical device companies in Maryland. This effort will address a key problem in the region – an insufficient number of experienced entrepreneurs – and help the region establish itself as a prominent innovation cluster for medical devices through the creation and success of a critical number of medical device start-ups based on the commercialization of university technologies. Statement of Services Required: TEDCO is seeking contracts with up to four Medical Device Executives for the Program. Each Medical Device Executive will be asked to lead the effort on 2 – 3 commercialization projects at a time, but will work collaboratively with other Medical Device Executives on all projects in the Program. TEDCO will seek to build a diverse team of Medical Device Executives each of which will have a specific strength in one of the following areas: regulatory matters, reimbursement, engineering/quality management, or clinical environments. Medical Device Executives will participate in the selection of companies/projects that will be accepted into the Program. They will work with the inexperienced management of those companies and guide them through a stage-gate product development process that will ultimately lead to a 510(k) clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of a commercially viable product at the end of 18 to 24 months. One goal of the mdPACE program is to develop a commercialization model that can be duplicated in other areas of the country. In addition to working with companies/projects, Medical Device Executives will be expected to help shape the Program itself to best achieve this goal. Medical Device Executives will be expected to commit up to 20% of their time (8 hours per week) to the mdPACE program. Medical Device Executives will work with their project companies and participate in monthly Program meetings to make stage-gate decisions and to provide status updates to the other Medical Device Executives and mdPACE staff. Since the Program is new and likely to evolve over time, the roles and responsibilities of the Medical Device Executives are likely to change. Medical Device Executives will be responsible for adapting to these Program changes and performing other tasks necessary to ensure the success of the Program. Date and Time by which Proposals must be Returned: TEDCO asks that individuals interested in applying to become a Medical Device Executive for the Program submit a résumé or CV with a cover letter indicating why they are interested in the mdPACE program and why they would be a good candidate. TEDCO requests that applicants submit resumés/CVs via e-mail prior to July 31, 2015 to ‘Program Manager’ at reply@tedco.md however, candidates will be considered as soon as résumés/CVs are received. Evaluation Criteria: Medical Device Executives must have experience with medical device product development and commercialization – specifically, obtaining an FDA clearance [510(k) pathway] for at least one medical device product. Other evaluation criteria to be considered include: an understanding of medical device markets, experience advising medical device companies, familiarity with the Stage-Gate Product Development process and quality management systems, experience working in a start-up environment, and familiarity with the commercialization of university technologies. Finally, candidates will be selected based on the Program’s need for a diversity of expertise in one of the following areas: regulatory matters, reimbursement, engineering/quality management, or clinical environments. TEDCO may conduct interviews and reference checks with selected candidates. Compensation: Medical Device Executives will be compensated at the rate of $85.00 per hour. Ideally, TEDCO is seeking Medical Device Executives that find value in working with early-stage medical device companies for the opportunity to give back and support promising new entrepreneurs. Such work might also provide an opportunity for the Executives to formally join or otherwise engage with a promising new company after it has completed the mdPACE program. Other: Applicants are subject to Subpart C of 2 C.F.R. Part 180 , “OMB Guidelines to Agencies on Government-wide Debarment and Suspension (Nonprocurement).” Applicants may not be subject to any debarment or suspension with any government agency or otherwise excluded or disqualified from receiving federal funds.",,"EDA, Evaluation Criteria: Medical Device, Executives, FDA, Johns Hopkins University, Program, Subpart C of, Suspension (Nonprocurement, The Maryland Technology Development Corporation, Time, the Department of Commerce, the Economic Development Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, the Medical Device Executives, the Stage-Gate Product Development, the University of Maryland"

(June 10, 2015) – The Maryland Stem Cell Research Commission (Commission) has completed its review of the 175 applications received in response to its FY 2015 Requests for Applications (RFAs). The board of directors of the Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) approved the Commission’s recommendation to fund 29 new proposals with the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund’s (MSCRF) $9.4 million FY2015 budget. These projects show promise of contributing to cures for some of today’s most debilitating diseases and conditions such as diabetes, vascular disease, Gaucher, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diseases treatable by bone marrow, autism, and obesity. Since its establishment in 2006, the Commission has had the goal of promoting State-funded stem cell research and cures through grants to public and private entities in the State. Recently the researchers at Johns Hopkins performed a half-match bone marrow transplant that was funded by Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund. This pioneering procedure successfully treated Shauna Whisenton’s sickle cell disease and gave her a new lease on life. To learn more about a sickle cell success story, click here . This year’s MSCRF awards include: 1 Pre-Clinical Research Award – This funding mechanism provides up to $500,000 over up to three years and is designed for companies conducting pre-clinical research in Maryland that seek to advance medical therapies in the State. The award in this category will focus on chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). 8 Investigator-Initiated Research Awards – These grants provide up to $600,000 of direct costs for up to three years, and are designed for Maryland investigators who have preliminary data to support their hypotheses. The awardees in this category will focus on Parkinson’s, aplastic anemia, Gaucher disease, bone marrow transplantation, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), heart disease and traumatic brain injury. 11 Exploratory Research Awards – These grants provide up to $200,000 of direct costs for up to two years, and are designed for Maryland researchers who are new to the stem cell field (young investigators and scientists from other fields), or for exploratory projects that have little or no preliminary data. FY 2015 awards in this category will address such topics as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, mental disorders, peripheral vascular disease, spinal cord injury, obesity, diabetes, diseases treatable by bone marrow, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 9 Post Doctoral Fellowship Awards – These grants provide up to $110,000 for up to two years, including direct and indirect costs and fringe benefits, and are designed for post-doctoral fellows who wish to conduct human stem cell research in Maryland. FY 2015 awards in this category will address such topics as schizophrenia, obesity, heart, ALS, autism and mental disorders. “We were very impressed with the quality of the applications this year for these important research grants,” said Rabbi Avram Reisner, Chair of the Commission. “Each of these awardees represents one of the keys to the future of regenerative medicine. The Commission is grateful to Governor Hogan and our legislators for their continued support of stem cell research as we demonstrate a clear connection between innovative medical research and economic development in the state of Maryland.  ” For a complete list of the names of the Principal Investigators (PIs), their project titles and institutions, please visit http://www.mscrf.org/content/awardees/2015Awardees.cfm .

Governor Hogan Announces Enhanced Funding for Startup Companies | TEDCO,"Tuesday, May 26, 2015",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2015/governor-hogan-announces-enhanced-funding-startup-companies,,,"Tuesday, May 26, 2015 Annapolis Annapolis, Md. (May 26, 2015) – Governor Larry Hogan today announced enhanced funding opportunities for technology startup companies through the Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO). TEDCO’s Technology Commercialization Fund (TCF) and Cybersecurity Investment Fund (CIF) will now provide up to $225,000 to support projects that advance a technology toward commercialization in Maryland.  In addition, TEDCO is broadening the scope of the TCF program by eliminating certain eligibility requirements.  This change opens the door for more Maryland companies to participate in the program. “Providing the right tools and resources to our entrepreneurs is critical to building a diverse economic foundation,” said Governor Hogan. “TEDCO’s funding programs fill the critical gap between the development phase and launch phase in the life of a startup company. The more financial support we can provide to our startups, the faster they will get to the commercial launch stage, and create jobs in communities all across Maryland.” TEDCO’s TCF and CIF programs provide critical product development funding that enables companies at an early stage to achieve a significant milestone and better position the company for follow-on investment. The enhanced funding will be issued in the form of a new, second investment that follows the standard TCF/CIF investment. The standard initial investment of $100,000 will support projects that advance a technology toward commercialization. The second investment, which will be subject to concurrent qualified financing, will be in the amount of $125,000.  This funding will support further development before startup companies are ready to launch a product, and it will create an incentive for other investment. “In Maryland, we are committed to supporting innovators, which are the foundation of the startup ecosystem,” said DBED Secretary Mike Gill. “We want to make sure entrepreneurs have the right tools and resources at the right time to help them move further and lead to a sustainable growth.” “Startups often require follow-on funding to support further development to generate revenues,” said Rob Rosenbaum, president and executive director of TEDCO. “TEDCO’s goal is to bridge this funding gap and help build successful companies to spur economic development in this region.” TEDCO’s TCF funding program is created to help develop and commercialize new products being developed by early-stage, technology-based companies in Maryland. The CIF program is designed to help cybersecurity technology companies to advance their product development toward commercialization. The application deadlines for the TCF and CIF are the 1 st and 15 th of each month, respectively. The review process for both programs is approximately two months. Interested companies are urged to review the Request for Applications (RFA) prior to initiating an application for either program (www.tedcomd.com). The enhanced funding will be available to all companies that closed on a TCF or CIF investment after November 1, 2014.  More information on the renewed programs can be found at www.tedcomd.com/funding .","Annapolis Annapolis, Hogan, Larry Hogan, Mike Gill, Rob Rosenbaum, TEDCO’s","CIF, Cybersecurity Investment Fund, DBED, TCF, TCF/CIF, TEDCO’s, TEDCO’s Technology Commercialization Fund, the Maryland Technology Development Corporation"

TEDCO Receives i6 Challenge Grant Under the U.S. Commerce Department’s Regional Innovation Strategies Program | TEDCO,"Thursday, April 2, 2015",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2015/tedco-receives-i6-challenge-grant-under-us-commerce-departments,,,"Thursday, April 2, 2015 Columbia COLUMBIA, Md. (April 2, 2015) U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker today announced that Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO)  is among the first 26 recipients of the 2014 Regional Innovation Strategies program grants. The Regional Innovation Strategies (RIS) program, which is being run by the Department’s Economic Development Administration’s (EDA) Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship ( OIE ), is a new initiative designed to advance innovation and capacity-building activities in regions across the country through three different types of grants: i6 Challenge grants, Cluster Grants for Seed Capital Funds, and Science and Research Park Development Grants. Secretary Pritzker announced the recipients of the first two funding opportunities today. Recipients of the third grant will be announced in the coming weeks. “As America’s “Innovation Agency,” the Commerce Department has a key role to play in supporting the innovators and job creators of tomorrow,” said Secretary Pritzker. “We want to ensure that all entrepreneurs have access to the tools they need to move their ideas and inventions from idea to market. The Regional Innovation Strategies Program competition is designed to advance this mission across the United States, strengthening our economy and our global competitiveness.” TEDCO received a $500,000 i6 Challenge grant to create the mdSTEPP (STructure for Efficient Professional Product development) Program which will train the next generation of medical device entrepreneurs and leverage the various other resources in Maryland to form 5-7 new medical device companies each year. “I’m extremely pleased that TEDCO has been awarded the i6 Challenge award, which will help Maryland entrepreneurs accelerate their transition  from innovation to commercialization in the medical device field,” said Governor Larry Hogan. “Maryland is a leader in technology development and this program will further enhance the array of resources to increase job creation. mdSTEPP Program  will become an important element  to our State’s economic development strategy.” “The main purpose of mdSTEPP Program is to increase the number of successful medical device start-ups in Maryland,” said Rob Rosenbaum, president and executive director of TEDCO. “With the support of the i6 Challenge award, TEDCO will create a virtual commercialization center that brings together innovation, aspiring entrepreneurs, and seasoned medical device executives to improve the efficiency of medical device commercialization in the region.” The mdSTEPP Program is similar to a business accelerator in that start-up medical device companies will be selected from an applicant pool, accepted into the Program, and graduate from the Program after 18-24 months. Upon completing the Program, these companies will be better positioned to attract investment, hire employees, and generate revenues. The i6 Challenge , was launched in 2010 as part of the Startup America Initiative , and is now in its fourth iteration. i6 is a national competition that makes small, targeted, high-impact investments to support startup creation, innovation, and commercialization. Now that the i6 Challenge is included in the new Regional Innovation Strategies Program, the funding will support more than just Proof-of-Concept Centers. Investments will also go toward the expansion of existing centers and in later-stage Commercialization Centers, which help innovators fine tune and scale their innovations to bring new products and services to the market. The total amount of funding for the i6 Challenge under RIS is nearly $8 million.

TEDCO Invests in 3 Maryland Cybersecurity Startups | TEDCO,"Thursday, March 19, 2015",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2015/tedco-invests-3-maryland-cybersecurity-startups,,,"Thursday, March 19, 2015 Columbia Protenus, Ridgeback and Strajillion received funding from the Cybersecurity Investment Fund COLUMBIA, Md. (March 19, 2015) – The Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) announced today that three Maryland companies received funding from its Cybersecurity Investment Fund (CIF). Strajillion , Protenus , and Ridgeback are the first three companies, each receiving $100,000, through CIF. The Fund supports Maryland companies develop and commercialize new cybersecurity products or services by providing investments of up to $100,000. “CIF is the first dedicated cybersecurity fund created in the State to help establish Maryland as the innovation hub of information security,” said Rob Rosenbaum, president and executive director of TEDCO. “We are extremely pleased to have funded these companies and believe they have created very unique products and with the financial support from CIF, are confident they can accelerate their development and commercial launch.” Strajillion , located in Johns Hopkins Fast Forward incubator, empowers and supports parents raising kids in the mobile + social world with its modern parenting tool RAKKOON. The cloud-based management tool enables parents to see where their children are, what apps they are using, who they are communicating with, and what they are saying. It is Mobile Device Management (MDM) for parents, but with family-specific features and enhancements, such as social media intelligence. Protenus Inc ., co-located with Sage Growth Partners in Baltimore, helps hospitals protect patient data in the electronic medical record using analytical tools that detect privacy breaches in real-time. The company’s solution takes a new approach to HIPAA compliance that empowers hospitals with the ability to detect, thwart, and remediate patient privacy breaches as they occur in electronic health records. Ridgeback Network Defense , located in bwtech@UMBC incubator, offers a security appliance as a low-maintenance cyber security device that attaches to an organization’s networks. Ridgeback actively defends an organization’s assets by analyzing network activity in real time, modeling the flow of information and evaluating the appropriateness of all activity occurring on the network. Ridgeback provides an in-memory automated response to information security intrusions and, through alerting and mitigation techniques effectively neutralizes these threats. “We are thrilled to receive investment from TEDCO’s CIF program,” said Robert Lord, co-founder of Protenus. “This investment will help us build and test our product to deliver dependable data on the internal use and management of patient information and to scale to multiple hospitals.” Funding from TEDCO’s CIF program help companies achieve early technical milestones that are critical to advancing their cybersecurity technologies toward commercialization. Qualifying cybersecurity technologies include all of the processes and mechanisms by which any devices or software that are part of, or connected to, any digital network are protected from unintended or unauthorized access, vulnerabilities, attacks, use, change or destruction. Additionally, computer and critical infrastructure security includes protection from unplanned events and natural disasters. General guidelines and an application for the CIF can be found on the TEDCO website. The applications are accepted monthly by the 15th. Entrepreneurs interested in applying for the fund may contact Ron Kaese, Program Manager, by phone at 410-715-4170 or by email at rkaese@tedco.md.","Ridgeback, Ridgeback Network Defense, Rob Rosenbaum, Robert Lord, Ron Kaese","CIF, Cybersecurity Investment Fund, Johns Hopkins Fast Forward, MDM, Mobile Device Management, RAKKOON, State, TEDCO, The Maryland Technology Development Corporation, the Cybersecurity Investment Fund COLUMBIA"
Sonavex Wins Top Prize in AUTM Venture Forum | TEDCO,"Sunday, March 1, 2015",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2015/sonavex-wins-top-prize-autm-venture-forum,,,"Sunday, March 1, 2015 Columbia Deerfield, IL — Sonavex LLC won $10,000 in the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) business plan competition during the 2015 AUTM Venture Forum held on Tuesday, Feb. 25, during the 2015 AUTM Annual Meeting in New Orleans. The Baltimore-based startup is developing a line of products called EchoSure—implantable and bioabsorbable markers (EchoMark) and ultrasound software packages (EchoFind) designed to detect the formation of blood clots after at-risk procedures. The medical device company was formed as a Johns Hopkins University spinout in 2013. Initial funding to support the development of the technology came from the TEDCO Maryland Innovation Initiative program and the Johns Hopkins-Coulter Translational Research Partnership. “By delivering visual and quantitative blood flow data, surgeons can detect potentially catastrophic clots while there is still time to intervene,” explained Sonavex COO David Narrow. “Not only does the device improve patient outcomes, but also spares the payer substantial expense by minimizing revision procedures.” Narrow estimates that EchoSure could save U.S. hospitals more than $180 million annually in the plastic surgery segment alone. Sonavex was among four finalists who made their pitch to venture capitalists for the $10,000 prize at AUTM’s Venture Forum. The final four were selected out of 47 submissions, which were reviewed by 38 judges. “The AUTM Venture Forum is an exciting example of the many ways new technologies are coming out of research universities all over the world and moving into the commercial marketplace,” said AUTM President Fred Reinhart, RTTP. “It allows us to bring real-world examples of how universities are working with business and industry to create products and services that are truly driving today’s global knowledge economy.” AUTM Assistant Vice President for the Annual Meeting Claire Driscoll said, “We were thrilled with the response to this year’s competition, and we were delighted to be able to select from such a diverse and high-caliber set of startup company business plans. “It’s very rewarding to provide a public showcase for these innovative companies and give them an opportunity to garner feedback and advice from successful venture capitalists,” continued Driscoll. “These university-based startups were born from academic research and they are making a positive economic and, in many cases, a significant public health or societal impact as well.” The 2015 AUTM Venture Forum, which was sponsored by Haiyin Venture Partners, Smith Moore Leatherwood LLP and iStart, provided attendees an opportunity to hear from and interact with some of the top institutional and corporate venture investors in the country. The event will be offered again during the 2016 AUTM Annual Meeting, Feb. 14 – 17, in San Diego.

Maryland Innovation Initiative Awards Over $6.4 Million to 67 Commercialization Projects | TEDCO,"Wednesday, July 23, 2014",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2014/maryland-innovation-initiative-awards-over-64-million-67,,,"Wednesday, July 23, 2014 Columbia COLUMBIA, Md. (July 23, 2014) – The Maryland Innovation Initiative (MII), which accelerates commercialization and technology transfer from university labs to start-up companies, announced it has awarded $6.4 million to 67 commercialization projects and start-up companies in fiscal year 2014. Awards were given across a variety of industries, including therapeutic, software, medical devices and mobile technologies. MII is administered by the Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO). The MII program was created as a partnership between the State of Maryland and five Maryland academic research institutions: University of Maryland, College Park University of Maryland, Baltimore County University of Maryland, Baltimore Johns Hopkins University and Morgan State University. The program is designed to increase the rate of commercializing research conducted in the partnership universities and leverage each institution’s strengths. Since it starting accepting applications in November 2012, more than 200 applications have been submitted for consideration. “The momentum we’ve seen around the Maryland Innovation Initiative in the last fiscal year is a testament to the quality of the work done at our State’s top-notch research universities, widely considered among the best in the country,” said Governor Martin O’Malley. “The program is designed to help bring university technologies to market, and with many projects already having spawned start-up companies, we’re seeing the contributions MII is making to growing Maryland’s innovation economy.” Since beginning to distribute funding in 2013, MII has funded 16 start-up companies and 79 university proof-of-concept projects with more than $9.3 million. The last funding cycle of the 2014 fiscal year was MII’s largest award round to date, which saw the investment of more than $1.4 million to 17 projects spanning all five partnership universities, including 2 start-up companies. The amount and number of investments in FY2014 more than doubled the awards of last year. Awards were given through the Innovation Commercialization Program, which provides funding to support the commercialization of qualified university technologies at three distinct stages: proof-of-concept/technology validation (Phase I), commercialization planning (Phase II) and early-stage product development (Phase III). Multiple projects have begun moving through the program toward commercialization, including a drug development platform from Morgan State University and bridge sensor technology from the University of Maryland, College Park, that is being tested in the field. “The Maryland Innovation Initiative is investing in a diverse array of technologies in several different stages of development,” said MII Board Chairman Robert Hallenbeck. “With start-up companies like the Johns Hopkins University start-up respEQ, Inc. having been awarded funding for all three of MII’s development phases, we can see the fruit of early investments in bringing innovative technologies to market. The boom in interest for this program and the quality of the applications are signals of Maryland’s thriving economy.” Projects that have received funding can be viewed on TEDCO’s website. Applications for the Maryland Innovation Initiative are currently being accepted and are reviewed on a bimonthly basis.

Towson University Commercializes a TEDCO-Supported Technology to Aid the Blind | TEDCO,"Thursday, May 1, 2014",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2014/towson-university-commercializes-tedco-supported-technology-aid,,,"Thursday, May 1, 2014 Columbia Towson University has launched its first commercialization with SoundsRight, a sounds CAPTCHA which received a patent and has been licensed to two organizations. CAPTCHAs are the security features with distorted letters that ask users to retype them to assure a website that users are not automated bots. A visual CAPTCHA is not something that people with limited sight can use and so they are prevented from availing themselves of such features. The SoundsRight team at Towson University, led by Dr. Jonathan Lazar, has developed a series of sounds, such as a barking dog and a neighing horse, which a person can identify as a sound CAPTCHA from among other sounds. When presented with a sound which is part of the CAPTCHA, the user hits a space bar. Towson is partnering with the National Federation of the Blind and AOL to develop their technology further. Other companies have also expressed an interest in using this technology. The SoundsRight technology previously received funding from the University Technology Development Fund (UTDF) to produce a prototype. [READ MORE LINK] Replacing the UTDF, the Technology Validation Program (TVP) is the current program available to all Maryland Universities, except for Johns Hopkins, Morgan State, and University of Maryland Baltimore, Baltimore County, and College Park, which can apply for similar funding through TEDCO’s MII program. TVP provides up to $40,000 for developing a technology to make it more easily commercialized.

RBI2 provides technical and business assistance to small and early-stage technology-based companies in rural Maryland, including Western Maryland (Garrett, Allegany, Washington and Frederick counties), Southern Maryland (Charles, Calvert and St. Mary’s counties), Northeastern Maryland (Carroll, Harford and Cecil counties) and the Eastern Shore (Kent, Caroline, Queen Anne, Talbot, Dorchester, Wicomico, Worcester and Somerset counties). The program is designed to help companies overcome business and technical hurdles and advance to the next growth level. Over the last three years, RBI2 provided more than 5,000 hours of no-cost guidance and mentorship to more than 400 companies across the state. “In Maryland, our innovation economy is driven by entrepreneurs from every corner of the state – not just our population centers,” said Gov. Martin O’Malley. “The investment we are making in our rural communities through TEDCO’s Rural Business Innovation Initiative means  technology start-ups from Western Maryland to the Eastern Shore will have access to outstanding resources and mentoring to help them succeed.” “I am proud to have worked with my fellow legislators to provide funding to TEDCO’s Rural Business Innovation Initiative for fiscal year 2015, which will support up-and-coming businesses in my constituency,” said Del. John L. Bohanan, Jr. “I have seen first-hand the impact that RBI2 has had in Southern Maryland and how it translates into growth for both our local and State economy.” “We are incredibly grateful that Governor O’Malley and our state legislators recognize the value of TEDCO’s Rural Business Innovation Initiative in bringing entrepreneurs across Maryland to the next level of business success by providing funding to the RBI2 program,” said Rob Rosenbaum, president and executive director of TEDCO. “With the State’s investment in business innovation in our rural communities, TEDCO will be able to provide even higher levels of mentoring and technical assistance to those start-ups and entrepreneurs.” Companies that meet the eligibility requirements for this program receive ongoing mentoring at no cost.

Tips for Working with the MERL or any Adviser | TEDCO,"Saturday, March 1, 2014",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2014/tips-working-merl-or-any-adviser,,,"Saturday, March 1, 2014 Columbia Successful entrepreneurs quickly realize that they do not possess all of the skills and experience required to grow their company, but rather need access to additional expertise. Without a full management team in place, these entrepreneurs look to a diverse team of advisers to help them through the formative stages of their company.  To ensure the relationship between the adviser and the entrepreneur is productive and long lasting, it is important that each party has a clear set of expectations. Read on to access TEDCO’s tips for working with advisers to make the most of the relationships entrepreneurs develop with their advisers. 1. Respect your adviser’s time. Advisers are often individuals with a significant amount of experience in their field. Their time is valuable, so make sure your meeting is productive and be considerate of the amount of time that you request. Show up on time, be well-prepared and focus on the issues on which you would like advice. 2. Remember that advisers are not business partners. Advisers advise you should not expect them to roll-up their sleeves to help you write a business plan or review a 25-page proposal. They may offer to do some work above and beyond an advisory capacity, but it is best to let them offer this rather than requesting it. 3. Rely on advisers’ expertise to refine your value proposition. Do not expect MERL members or other business advisers to provide you with a list of investors rather, they can help your company develop its value proposition. 4. See how the relationship develops before asking advisers to join your company. Asking someone to join your team is a decision that should not be made lightly.  It is best to work with someone for a while to determine if they would be a good fit for your company before asking them to join your team.",,

"Study Finds TEDCO Supports more than $565.9 Million in Economic Contributions and 2,835 Jobs in the State of Maryland Annually | TEDCO","Wednesday, January 29, 2014",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2014/study-finds-tedco-supports-more-5659-million-economic-contributions,,"Government Program Development, Affairs & Policy","Wednesday, January 29, 2014 Columbia Independent third-party economic development study conducted by Battelle Technology Partnership Practice analyzes economic impact of the Maryland Technology Development Corporation COLUMBIA, Md. (Jan. 29, 2014) – A recent third-party economic development impact study conducted by Battelle Technology Partnership Practice (TPP), the world’s largest non-profit research and development organization, has found that the Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) currently supports more than $565.9 million in economic contributions and more than 2,835 jobs in the State of Maryland annually, earning $200.5 million in salaries with estimated State and local government revenues of $22.8 million. The study also determined the economic contribution of TEDCO programs is projected to grow to $910.3 million and support a total of 4,527 jobs by 2018. These jobs will earn $320.3 million in salaries with estimated State and local government revenues of $36.6 million. “The role that TEDCO plays in sustaining and creating Maryland’s innovation economy is critical and proven,” said Governor Martin O’Malley. “TEDCO is responsible for enabling almost 3,000 jobs to be created in Maryland, jobs that are helping to feed families and pay mortgages all the while working toward technological discoveries that better our everyday lives. TEDCO plays a huge role in making Maryland a national leader in technology development and life sciences, and ultimately demonstrates why Maryland is a great place to do business and call home.” The study focused on the impact of three core TEDCO programs: the Technology Commercialization Fund (TCF) which provides up to $100,000 to support companies that advance a technology toward commercial adoption the Maryland Innovation Initiative (MII), a $5.8 million annual program to enhance and expand technology transfer and company start-ups at five Maryland universities (Johns Hopkins, Morgan State, University of Maryland College Park, University of Maryland Baltimore County and University of Maryland Baltimore) and the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund (MSCRF), a unit within TEDCO which promotes State-funded stem cell research. The study factored in the direct, indirect and induced impacts of these programs: “TEDCO invests many resources into making Maryland the premier location for entrepreneurship and company formation and nothing demonstrates this commitment more than the results found in this study,” said Jack Lewin, TEDCO chair. “Through just three of its funding programs, TEDCO contributes more than $565.9 million towards Maryland’s economy. Considering TEDCO has more than 12 funding, support and venture capital programs, the significance of TEDCO is evident.” In TEDCO’s signature TCF program, portfolio companies had a total direct employment of 1,147 jobs and estimated annual revenues of $321.3 million. This company revenue generated $539.6 million in economic activity in Maryland, supported 2,666 jobs earning $188.7 million in salaries and provided $21.7 million in estimated revenues to the State and local governments. Looking ahead, the economic impacts associated with TEDCO’s operations will increase as the portfolio of TEDCO-assisted companies grows, through both the expansion of the existing portfolio companies and the addition of new companies assisted by TEDCO programs: Additionally, the study determined that return on Maryland’s investment is high. In FY 2013, two TEDCO programs (TCF and MII) produced a 23 percent return on investment. Based on current levels of investment in TEDCO and the projected growth of the portfolio companies assisted by TEDCO’s core technology commercialization programs, the return on investment is projected to increase to 27 percent in 2018. “Never has it been clearer: TEDCO is a vital component of Maryland’s economic development strategy and technology commercialization system,” said Rob Rosenbaum, TEDCO president and executive director. “The organization is a champion for Maryland entrepreneurship and early-stage business development, so every investment in TEDCO is an investment in Maryland’s future. We are extremely proud of our achievements and further inspired and energized by the economic forecasting found in this report.” Since its founding in 1998, TEDCO has 234 thriving portfolio companies which have secured $601 million in follow-on funding, resulting in a leverage ratio of 48 to 1.TEDCO also has contributed $111 million to research innovation with 319 research projects funded.

Commission also announces 2014 Request for Applications. BALTIMORE (Sept. 24, 2013) – In the U.S., between 70,000 and 100,000 people have sickle cell disease and many of these patients are in Maryland. To bring awareness and education to this illness, the Maryland Stem Cell Research Commission (Commission) today hosted a sickle cell summit titled, “Sickle Cell Disease in Maryland: How Can We Optimize Therapy and Care?.” Before the summit, which was held in Anne Arundel County, Md., the Commission also approved its 2014 Requests for Applications (RFAs). “Sickle cell disease is a serious medical condition that affects thousands of Marylanders each and every day,” said Rabbi Avram Israel Reisner, chair of the Commission. “Because of the vested public interest in sickle cell disease, the Commission felt it was important to put together an event that highlights treatment advancements and research regarding this disease. Stem cells play a crucial role in the future of sickle cell treatment and we’re pleased to present this summit which also draws attention to the importance of Maryland’s stem cell research program.” “Scientific advances offer tremendous hope for the treatment of sickle cell disease,” said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, Secretary of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH). “I appreciate the work that will be done today to bring together patients, clinicians, and researchers to accelerate progress.” The summit featured research, treatment and prevention panels as well as an advocacy and awareness panel. Opening speakers included Dr. Dan Gincel, Executive Director of the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund and Dr. Sharfstein. Other speakers included Dr. Robert Brodsky from Johns Hopkins Medicine who discussed half-matched bone marrow transportation for sickle cell disease Dr. Debbie Badawi of DHMH who spoke about newborn screening and long term care follow-up of sickle cell disease Dr. Sophia Lanzkron of the Johns Hopkins  Sickle Cell Infusion Center who provided insight on the impact of sickle cell infusion outcomes in Md. Delegate Shirley Nathan-Pulliam and Dr. Sonja Banks of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America. Following the Commission’s sickle cell summit, the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America kicked-off its 41st annual convention titled “Moving Forward: Advocating for New Discoveries, Advancements and Breakthroughs,” also being held in Anne Arundel County. The Commission also approved earlier today its four research funding programs for 2014. RFAs include: Investigator-Initiated Grants, Exploratory Grants, Post-Doctoral Fellowships, and Pre-Clinical and Clinical Grants. This funding cycle, all research proposals must pertain to stem cell based therapy and regenerative medicine. Priority will be given to translational and collaborative projects. In addition, the Commission announced the continuance of its partnership with the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) for the fourth year in a row. Through the program, Maryland researchers have the opportunity for collaboration with CIRM researchers with the goal of advancing critical human stem cell therapies by fostering meritorious interdisciplinary research across geographical boundaries.

The Propel Baltimore Fund Invests in Social Toaster and Woofound | TEDCO,"Monday, August 12, 2013",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2013/propel-baltimore-fund-invests-social-toaster-and-woofound,,,"Monday, August 12, 2013 Columbia COLUMBIA, Md. (Aug. 12, 2013) – The Propel Baltimore Fund is banking on tech-driven businesses with its latest investments in two of the most talked about start-ups in Baltimore, Social Toaster and Woofound. The Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO), in collaboration with The Abell Foundation and the France-Merrick Foundation, manages Propel Baltimore, a $4.3 million angel investment fund for entrepreneurs and start-up companies located in Baltimore City. Through the fund, companies can receive investments of up to $250,000. Social Toaster and Woofound are the second and third investments the fund has made as it celebrates its first full year of operation. “Propel Baltimore seeks to support Baltimore City’s most promising start-up companies, and there’s no doubt that Social Toaster and Woofound both possess compelling investments with strong growth potential,” said Abell Foundation President Robert C. Embry, Jr. “Baltimore is an excellent place to do business, and we look forward to continuing to develop the incredible talent right here in the city through Propel Baltimore. We congratulate both of these companies on their success to date, and wish them the best as they continue to take the marketplace by storm.” Social Toaster helps brands effectively communicate with their fans on social media, engaging the most interested fans as ambassadors who help amplify brand messages. The Propel Baltimore Fund invested $200,000 in Social Toaster’s latest round of financing.  In addition, the company recently won $200,000 through the InvestMaryland program, a project of the Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development. Based in Baltimore, Social Toaster helps clients including the Baltimore Ravens organization to identify their social media “super fans” and streamlines the process of getting those fans to broadcast clients’ content to their social networks. Woofound, which received a $200,000 investment from Propel Baltimore, is the creator of two applications: Compass and Explore. Both apps use a quick “visual personality assessment,” in which users view a series of images and decide whether the images describe them or not, to provide tailored personality profiles. Compass analyzes a users’ personality traits and recommends career paths, while Explore uses personality clues to suggest nearby social activities to users that can be filtered by price, category and time. The Propel Baltimore investment is part of a $2 million dollar funding round that Woofound just closed. “We are extremely pleased to fund two companies that have created very unique and well-received products,” said Rob Rosenbaum, president and executive director of TEDCO. “With these investments, we hope to help Social Toaster and Woofound achieve the next level of success.  Propel Baltimore still has plenty of capital to invest, so we encourage tech-focused companies located in Baltimore or willing to relocate to the city to apply for funding and reap the benefits of being a member of the TEDCO family.” The Propel Baltimore Fund is available to companies with new technology ideas or innovation-focused business plans that are currently based in or are willing to relocate to Baltimore City. The fund will lead investments into these companies and will require matching funds from other investors to go along with the Propel Baltimore Fund capital. The initial investment into each company will be $100,000 to $250,000. The Propel Baltimore Fund is seeking start-ups and early-stage companies that can provide returns to investors in five to seven years. General guidelines and an application for the Propel Baltimore Fund can be found on the TEDCO website. Entrepreneurs interested in applying for the fund may contact Randy Domolky, Managing Director at TEDCO, by phone at 410-715-4180 or by email at rdomolky@tedco.md. The Abell Foundation, Inc. is a nonprofit dedicated to enhancing the quality of life in Baltimore and Maryland. It also allocates a portion of its investment portfolio to direct investments in innovative technologies and early-stage companies that have exceptional social, environmental and economic return potential, including energy efficiency and alternate energy.

21/2 Minutes with TEDCO Executive Director Rob Rosenbaum | TEDCO,"Friday, July 5, 2013",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2013/212-minutes-tedco-executive-director-rob-rosenbaum,,,"Friday, July 5, 2013 Columbia (Columbia, MD) July 5, 2013 - Rob Rosenbaum heads the Maryland Technology Development Corp. How has TEDCO changed since you’ve been in charge? I’ve brought much more of an entrepreneur culture to TEDCO. It had vestiges of acting like a state-funded organization, which it was and still is. But I’ve brought much more of a pure entrepreneurial focus and have gotten the team to think about how we can incorporate and include more private sector involvement rather than just relying on state funding. What are the challenges of getting technology to market for entrepreneurs? The biggest challenge is not the technology but the people and management team behind it. The real decision is about whether to invest in the people, so we then spend a lot of time mentoring them, creating networks for them, and making them connections in the marketplace. It’s all about the entrepreneur: a good one can take an average idea and make it an incredible success. What problems do startups in Maryland face in general? There are two big problems. The first is the early stage funding gap: the post-TEDCO funding and pre-institutional investor funding. The second is finding good investors and mentors who can help them in the beginning. How do you help them overcome these problems? We started the Maryland Entrepreneurs Resource List, which now has 55 people vetted by TEDCO to help early-stage companies. They’re categorized by skill so entrepreneurs can find those with the specific experience they need. We also launched TEDCO Capital Partners, which manages four small, focused venture funds, all of which are 100 percent privately capitalized with no state money. That’s intended to fill the money gap post TEDCO. What’s in the future for TEDCO? My misson is to engage more private-sector activity. Private capitalization is expanding and becoming very established. I hope to expand TEDCO’s ability to influence entrepreneurship and innovation in the region with the new programs we have added and by adapting exisiting programs. We want to get a broader swath through the entrepreneur ecosystem. We just celebrated our 15th anniversary and are looking forward to another great 15 years.",Rob Rosenbaum,"TEDCO Capital Partners, the Maryland Entrepreneurs Resource List, the Maryland Technology Development Corp."

(May 21, 2013) – The Maryland Stem Cell Research Commission (Commission) has completed its review of the 171 applications received in response to its FY 2013 Requests for Applications (RFAs). The board of directors of the Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) approved the Commission’s recommendation to fund 31 new proposals with the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund’s (MSCRF) $10.4 million FY2013 budget. These projects, which include pre-clinical research and a clinical trial, will advance the field of regenerative medicine. “These awards are critical to ensuring that the groundbreaking research being done has the opportunity to move to the commercial marketplace,” said Governor Martin O’Malley. “I congratulate this year’s grant recipients and look forward to the contributions they make to the improved health and wellbeing of our citizens.” “Our awards for FY2013 fund projects that will study a diverse array of critical diseases and conditions,” said Margaret Conn Himelfarb, MPH, chair of the Commission. “We are especially pleased to support so many collaborations between universities, non-profit organizations, private research companies and NIH. Several of these partnerships leverage State funds with funding outside of Maryland. We thank Governor Martin O’Malley and the Maryland General Assembly for continuing to invest in the pioneering research that will lead to life saving stem cell therapies.” This funding cycle, the Commission gave priority to proposals that focus on advancing regenerative medicine by selecting promising research targeting cancer, sickle cell anemia, ALS, Parkinson’s disease, heart disease, muscular dystrophy, diabetes, lupus, epilepsy, and spinal cord injuries as well as end stage lung disease and other debilitating medical conditions. Researchers will also study noninvasive in vivo imaging of transplanted stem cells to determine their location and longevity. In addition, the Commission will continue its collaboration with the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), now in its third year. This year’s MSCRF awards include: 1 Pre-Clinical Research Award – This new funding mechanism provides up to $500,000 of direct costs per year for up to three years, and is designed for companies conducting pre-clinical research in Maryland that seek to advance medical therapies in the State. The goal of this proposal is clearance from the FDA to initiate a new clinical trial. This grant, awarded to a biotech company collaborating with a research institute and a hospital, is focused on developing a stem cell suture for tendon and ligament reconstruction in healing-impaired patients. 10 Investigator-Initiated Research Awards – These grants provide up to $600,000 of direct costs per year, for up to three years, and are designed for Maryland investigators who have preliminary data to support their hypotheses. Among other promising projects, new awardees in this category will work to create stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries develop a novel therapy for liver fibrosis visualize stem cells in brain tumors characterize cardiac stem cells in newborns develop a stem cell therapy for diabetes and conduct a clinical trial in patients with sickle cell disease and lupus. 10 Exploratory Research Awards – These grants provide up to $100,000 of direct costs per year, for up to two years, and are designed for Maryland researchers who are new to the stem cell field (young investigators and scientists from other fields), or for exploratory projects that have little or no preliminary data. FY2013 awards in this category will address such topics as stem cell imaging nerve regeneration a disease model of epilepsy a deficient pathway in Parkinson’s disease and improving lung transplant outcomes. 10 Post-Doctoral Fellowship awards – These grants provide up to $55,000 per year, for up to two years, including direct and indirect costs and fringe benefits, and are designed to train post-doctoral fellows who wish to conduct human stem cell research in Maryland. These grants will focus on ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease), sickle cell disease, diabetes, colon cancer, and stroke, among other topics. For a complete list of the names of the Principal Investigators (PIs), their project titles and institutions, please visit http://www.mscrf.org/content/awardees/2013Awardees.cfm. All MSCRF-funded research must be conducted in Maryland and must involve human stem cells. Each grant awarded by the Commission is contingent upon the PI obtaining all applicable ethical approvals to conduct the specified research, as well as a signed agreement with TEDCO that describes the scope of the project, requirements for sharing any cell line(s) developed with MSCRF funding and a commitment to publish the results. The final amount of each award will be determined during the due diligence process and will be listed in the MSCRF annual report scheduled for release in December 2013. All currently funded MSCRF researchers are required to present their findings at the 6th Annual Maryland Stem Cell Research Symposium to be held on December 3, 2013 in Baltimore, Md. About the Maryland Stem Cell Research Commission The Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund (MSCRF) was established by the State of Maryland under the Maryland Stem Cell Research Act of 2006 to promote State-funded stem cell research and cures through grants and loans to public and private entities in the State. Administered by the Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO), the MSCRF is overseen by an independent commission that sets policy and develops criteria, standards and requirements for applications to the Fund.

"GOVERNOR O’MALLEY PROMOTES INNOVATE MARYLAND, TOURS EMERGING TECHNOLOGY CENTER AT HOPKINS | TEDCO","Friday, April 13, 2012",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2012/governor-omalley-promotes-innovate-maryland-tours-emerging,,,"Friday, April 13, 2012 Annapolis Partnership with State, universities bridges delta between research and commercialization ANNAPOLIS, MD (April 13, 2012) – Governor Martin O’Malley today joined with entrepreneurs and business and university leaders at Baltimore’s Emerging Technology Center on 33rd Street to highlight the passage of Innovate Maryland. The bill was a key part of the Governor’s legislative package and seeks to bridge the delta between Maryland’s leadership in research and development and lagging behind in technology transfer and commercialization. Innovate Maryland creates a first-ever partnership between the State and five qualifying universities to advance cutting-edge research to the commercial marketplace and foster collaboration between the universities and federal laboratories. “Passing Innovate Maryland this year means creating the next Microsoft or Google here in Maryland, or watching it happen in another state,” said Governor O’Malley. “Our goal of moving 40 new discoveries and innovations out of the lab and into the marketplace each year will help create the next generation of jobs and fuel our Innovation Economy pipeline for decades to come.” Following his remarks, Governor O’Malley joined in a ribbon-cutting for one of the incubator’s newest companies, Juxtopia LLC, a biotech-IT company spun out of Morgan State University that has developed augmented reality goggles that are selling commercially. The Governor also toured the incubator’s Johns Hopkins Center for Bio Innovation Development (CBID), which houses three life sciences start-ups developing medical devices and also visited Ignition 72 LLC, a technology start-up founded by three advertising industry veterans that develops custom websites and web solutions, including interactive games. Opened in 2003, the incubator – a venture of the Baltimore Development Corp. – focuses on commercializing innovative technologies from Johns Hopkins and other regional research institutions. It currently has 30 companies in various industry sectors, including bio, IT and alternative energy, and has a number of notable graduates, including Moodlerooms, an education software company which grew from three employees in 2006 to nearly 100 and was recently sold to industry leader Blackboard. “Innovation is the cornerstone for Juxtopia to achieve its mission of improving human performance” said Dr. Jayfus T. Doswell, CEO of Juxtopia LLC. “Maryland has significantly supported Juxtopia’s research and development of innovate wearable augmented reality hardware and software that is now improving human performance.” Among Innovate Maryland’s qualifying research universities are Johns Hopkins University, Morgan State University, University of Maryland Baltimore, University of Maryland Baltimore County and University of Maryland College Park. The initiative would be administered by the Maryland Technology Development Corp. (TEDCO), a public corporation with 14 years’ experience funding tech transfer and development programs and providing assistance to entrepreneurs, and would be overseen by an Executive Director and eight-member board made up of representatives from academia, technology businesses and government. The State allocates $5 million and qualifying universities have agreed to contribute between $100,000 and $200,000 to fund start-up grants to researchers best positioned to move their discoveries into the commercial marketplace, with the goal of significantly increasing university spin-outs. “On behalf of the Maryland Technology Development Corporation, we would like to applaud Governor O’Malley and the Maryland General Assembly for championing this visionary initiative,” said Jack Lewin, Chair of the TEDCO board of directors. “Maryland leads the country in technology development and will continue to do so as we produce commercial applications and job creation through Innovate Maryland. The goals of the initiative align with TEDCO’s expertise in serving Maryland entrepreneurs, universities and Federal labs to support economic development. We are honored to play a role in this important plan.” “Johns Hopkins is placing more emphasis than ever on interdisciplinary research, particularly addressing the areas of engineering and medicine working together to solve clinical and therapeutic problems,” said Elizabeth Good Mazhari, Director of Ventures, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “This legislation further encourages inter-university partnerships and will help accelerate our ability to commercialize.” This is the second year that Governor O’Malley has targeted Maryland’s innovation economy as part of his legislative agenda. Last year, the Governor introduced InvestMaryland, an initiative created by the Governor and passed by the General Assembly to invest in the State’s promising start-up and early stage companies. Through an historic on-line auction last month, $84 million was raised for program, far exceeding a goal of $70 million. While other states have sold tax credits to fund similar venture capital initiatives, Maryland is the first state to use an online auction to raise the capital for such a program. The inaugural round of investments will be made in innovative companies this summer through several private venture capital firms and the State’s successful Maryland Venture Fund (MVF).","Blackboard, Elizabeth Good Mazhari, Jack Lewin, Jayfus T.

Researchers from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), Johns Hopkins University (JHU), Salisbury University and Towson University received up to $50,000 each in UTDF funding. Teams from the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) University of Maryland College Park (UMD) and JHU each received up to $15,000 in funding from TEDCO’s TechStart program. Five startup companies were launched as a result of these funding awards: BOSS Medical, CervoCheck, Clear Guide Medical, Lifelong Technologies and NexImmune. The aim of the UTDF program is to help researchers develop and assess the commercial viability of new technological inventions, test prototypes and optimize principle research designs. Since the inception of the UTDF in 2001, 95 projects have been completed and 43 have been licensed or optioned to private companies, 35 of which are located in Maryland. Of these licensees, 29 were startup companies in the state, 13 received follow-on funding through TEDCO’s Maryland Technology Transfer and Commercialization Fund program and seven through TEDCO’s TechStart program. The TechStart program provides funding to university and federal lab-based teams that include an inventor who is willing to assist in evaluating the feasibility of a startup, an experienced entrepreneur who will provide business guidance and a technology transfer manager. To receive funding, teams must submit a proposal to TEDCO for further evaluation. Recipients receive a maximum of $15,000 through TechStart, which defrays the costs of evaluating the probability of the startup’s opportunity. All Maryland university and federal lab teams are eligible for funding. Since the inception of TechStart in 2007, 29 projects have completed, resulting in 20 startup companies in the state. “The University Technology Development Fund and the TechStart program are incredible resources that give Maryland an advantage in advancing and commercializing cutting-edge technologies from our universities and federal labs,” said Rob Rosenbaum, president and executive director of TEDCO. “TEDCO is extremely proud of the fact that five companies were started as a result of this funding – a true example of economic development in action and a testament to the sound investment in early stage innovation.” UTDF Awards: From APL, the recipient is: Andrew F. Mason , Ph.D., a senior staff member, has been awarded $49,000 to develop a technology that uses chitosan, a byproduct of chitin, to sequester phosphate ions that cause harmful algal blooms in marine environments. Phosphate is a primary component of both agricultural runoff and storm water due to its use in fertilizer and its presence in animal waste. Dr. Mason and colleagues have data that shows that chitosan, which can be made from the natural waste product of shrimp shells, can successfully sequester aqueous phosphate ions. From JHU, the recipients are: Robert H. Allen, Ph.D., P.E., associate research professor of gynecology and obstetrics, who received $50,000 to develop a technology that allows obstetricians to more accurately diagnose early preterm labor and prescribe interventions to prolong the pregnancy and to improve fetal development. This device, by bypassing the maternal abdomen and measuring contractions in the cervix and vagina, enables more accurate diagnoses. This technology has become the core of a startup company, CervoCheck, LLC. Emad Boctor , Ph.D., assistant professor of radiology, was awarded $50,000 to further develop a needle tracking and intervention guidance device which uses ultrasound imaging. This allows needle-guided interventions to be done without the need for expensive, cumbersome external tracking devices that are currently used. This device will also allow the physician or ultrasound expert to find small or deep tumors which cannot yet be easily spotted by ultrasound. This technology has become the core of a startup company, Clear Guide Medical, LLC. A. Jay Khanna , M.D., associate professor of orthopedic surgery and biomedical engineering, was awarded $50,000 to develop a minimally-invasive bone tissue harvesting device with a softer drill. Bone grafting is used to help fuse bones and for healing in spinal fusions, which are widely used surgical procedures that increase the structural support of the spine. Dr. Khanna’s device allows for the collection of more bone tissue, a safer autograft, reduction of pain and better grafting. This technology is the core of a startup company, BOSS Medical, LLC . Aleksander Popel , Ph.D., professor of biomedical engineering, was awarded $50,000 to continue developing a therapeutic technology known as a mimetic peptide to treat cancer. These peptides mimic larger antibodies or proteins and show promise in inhibiting metastatic breast cancer and breast cancer that has not been responding to current treatments. The peptides are synthetic and have substitutions in them to make them more active. The advantages of using peptides are that they are smaller, more specific and more cost-effective to produce than antibodies they are less toxic than other currently-available cancer treatments and they do not cause immune reactions. This particular peptide also has an amino acid substitution to make it more stable and less likely to be broken down by proteases. Brendan Canning , Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Medicine, has been awarded $50,000 to further develop a treatment for coughing. A new cough drug hasn’t been introduced in half a century and the medicines currently available are minimally effective and addictive. Dr. Canning has discovered cough receptors that play an essential role in regulating the cough reflex and a group of compounds that are more effective in selectively targeting these receptors. Clifford Weiss , M.D., assistant professor of radiology, was awarded $50,000 to further develop a device that makes dialysis more effective. Dr. Weiss’s team has designed a device to access naturally high blood flows in the leg, as opposed to the artificially created ones in the arm that cause stenosis. This subcutaneous device provides two ports for access to the femoral vein and a third port for controlling a valve which closes access to vein when the patient is not in dialysis. The valve also allows the tubing to be cleaned. From Salisbury University, the recipient is: Mark Holland , Ph.D., professor and chair of the biology department, was awarded $50,000 to develop a technology that uses specific bacteria to stimulate the germination and root growth of seagrass seedlings. Dr. Holland has found that certain bacteria, pink pigmented facultative methlyotroph, stimulate germination and root growth of land plants. He will use the bacterization technology to improve the germination of eelgrass seedlings, which can improve the health of coastal fisheries. From Towson University, the recipient is: Tim Brooks , associate director of software development, was awarded $50,000 to futher develop an auditory Completely Automatic Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). The most commonly used CAPTCHAs present several alpha-numeric characters that have been distorted and ask users to type the correct characters to gain access to a website. Because visually impaired people have difficulty using these CAPTCHAs, the Towson team has developed a reCAPTCHA technology that depends on identifying a series of sounds such as bells. TechStart Awards: From UMB, the recipient is: Angelia Crawford , entrepreneur and graduate of the ACTiVATE program Dr. Robert O’Toole, M.D., assistant professor of Orthopedics and Dr. Nancy Cowger , Office of Technology Licensing at UMB, were awarded $8,000 to develop the Step Activity Monitor (SAM), a walking aid that provides quality data about patients’ physical activity to physicians. This important information can help doctors prevent future hospitalizations and death and provide better care to patients. The team will use the funding for a freedom to operate search. LifeLong Technologies, LLC was formed around the technology. From UMD, the recipient is: Ichiro Takeuchi , Ph.D., professor of engineering Sherry Xie , entrepreneur and Gayatri Varma , Ph.D., director of the Office of Commercialization, were awarded $13,000 to develop a thermoeleastic cooling technology invented by Dr. Takeuchi. Thermoelastic cooling uses a solid-solid phase transformation to absorb and release heat, which uses less energy and doesn’t require a hazardous coolant. This technology won first place in the Invention of the Year 2010 for physical science. The team will use the funding to determine freedom to operate, research marketing niche and investigate potential competitors. From JHU, the recipient is: Mathias Oelke , Ph.D., assistant professor of pathology Kenneth Carter , Ph.D., entrepreneur and Daniel Potvin , Ph.D., senior licensing associate, were awarded $15,000 to develop a technology that will destroy tumor cells. Dr. Oelke has produced an artificial antigen cell that mimics human immune systems’ dendritic cells. Antigens on the surface of dendritic cells stimulate natural killer T-cells (NKT cells) to destroy tumors. The platform technology developed by this team is an easy-to-assemble system in which different immunological signals can be attached to a bead or smaller quantum dot and used to activate NKT cells. The technology can be used to stimulate cells outside the body in culture and also can be injected into patients. The technology is being developed to treat melanoma specifically, but can be applied broadly. The team will use the funding to determine freedom to operate. A startup company was formed around this technology, NexImmune , Inc.","A. Jay Khanna, Aleksander Popel, Andrew F.

The Suicide Entrepreneur ™ | TEDCO,"Friday, February 4, 2011",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2011/suicide-entrepreneur-tm,,,"Friday, February 4, 2011 Columbia Suicide entrepreneurs have good intensions of creating great companies, but when realities of launching a successful start-up hit, these well-intentioned entrepreneurs are often responsible for their own demise. Their good intensions of creating a viable company jeopardize their company. Sometimes it is difficult to spot a suicide entrepreneur, for the trained observer (read: savvy investor), however, the traits are obvious. Suicide entrepreneurs: • are so in love with their technology that they cannot get out of the lab to develop the business • will not share any technical information about their product for fear of it being stolen • do not listen to advice from experts who are trying to help them, • lack customer validation to show that anyone wants the product • create companies that are way too insular everyone involved is a family member which is a red light for investors and • have companies that are not focused on one product, but many which dilutes their ability to bring any one product to market. Unfortunately, I have way too many stories to tell about the suicide entrepreneur. A classic example involves a married couple that licensed a technology. They were passionate about the technology, however, neither one of them was an engineer nor did they understand their potential customers’ needs. They thought they had the solution – hire an engineer to develop the technology and let the customers come running. An  important fact to note is this was the first start-up company for both of them, and being a husband and wife team made it difficult to raise capital. Their biggest mistake was executing their plan exactly as envisioned. They took the product to an industry show after the designs were complete and prototypes were manufactured. The prototypes received positive feedback from potential customers, but there were no purchases. The technology was too difficult to install. However, customers said if the product could be installed another way they would purchase it. By that point, the company ran out of their seed money, was not able to raise any additional capital and was unable to redesign their device. Had they met customers before designing the device, they could have avoided this costly mistake. Sadly, they were forced to close their doors. Most entrepreneurs go into business because they believe their product can make a difference. I am willing to mentor any entrepreneur who wants to make their vision a reality, and work at it. It all goes back to three things: 1) being self-aware, 2) being willing to take risks, and 3) avoiding ALL suicide entrepreneur tendencies in favor of doing what is necessary to make your company a success.",,

Over the last three years, the MSRF has committed $56 million to stem cell researchers in Maryland. The full report can be accessed at http://www.mscrf.org/content/awardees/index.cfm. The Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund was established to promote state-funded stem cell research and has a FY 2010 budget of $12.4 million. Consistent with NIH practices – as indicated in the Maryland Stem Cell Research Act of 2006 – the Commission considers grant applications confidential and does not release specific application data until awards are made. Applications will be evaluated by an independent peer review committee composed of scientifically recognized experts in the field of stem cell research that reside out of the State. The grants to be awarded under these three RFAs will fund basic and translational research with human stem cells of all types, as defined in the Maryland Stem Cell Research Act of 2006. The goals of this program are to broaden and advance basic knowledge of human stem cell biology that will be relevant for eventual development of clinical applications, and to enable, support and accelerate such clinical applications for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human diseases and conditions.","Karen Rothenberg, MSRF, Martin O’Malley","Commission, Investigator-Initiated Research Grants, Letters of Intent, Maryland Stem Cell Research Symposium, NIH, Post-Doctoral Fellowship Grants, Post-Doctoral Research Grants, State, The Maryland Stem Cell Research Commission (Commission, The Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund, These Investigator-Initiated Research Grants, World Stem Cell Summit, the Commission for FY 2010, the Maryland Stem Cell Research Act, the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund"

Challenges for Startups: Getting them on the Road to Success | TEDCO,"Tuesday, January 12, 2010",https://www.tedcomd.com/news-events/press-releases/2010/challenges-startups-getting-them-road-success,,,"Tuesday, January 12, 2010 Columbia There are four main concerns that are important for getting a startup   company on the road to success.These are that the Startup have a unique solution to a problem,  that the founders have a target market, that the company have an entrepreneur and a management team with business experience, and that the company have funding to achieve their first milestones. • Problem and Solution A cool technology is not enough to start a business rather, the technology needs to answer a   problem and the solution needs to be better than other solutions which are currently offered in the marketplace.  For example, when Facebook was developed there were already many social networking sites.   However, Facebook was different.  It was developed in a university setting where users felt comfortable revealing their identities.  This made it easier to find friends, which gave Facebook a unique advantage over the other sites.   Once Facebook had large numbers of users, it could compete with other sites. (Dinesh Ganesarajah, Kellogg School of Management) • Market If the founders or CEO of a business hope to eventually attract angel and venture money, they need to consider the size of their market.  It needs to be large enough to supply returns for these investors.   Alternatively, the founders can bootstrap or rely on their own funds or revenue to move the business forward. • Management Team-Led by an Entrepreneur While university startups are often initiated by the inventor, an inventor often lacks the business experience to take the technology forward as a commercial product.   It generally takes a management team that is led by an experienced entrepreneur.   An entrepreneur is defined as the owner or manager of a business enterprise who by risk and initiative attempts to make a profit (Collins English Dictionary, 2009).  A serial entrepreneur is the best.  This is someone who has started up a company previously and has more experience understanding the market, has more important connections with other entrepreneurs and with investors, and is willing to take a risk. • Funding Startup and seed funding is essential for the new company.  In order to move forward with the new business, the founder or CEO will need capital to meet milestones in the development of the product and to launch his/her business.   The company can bootstrap, depending on friends and family, the founders’ money, or services to provide capital.  Some entrepreneurs start a business part-time.  However, this can send a red flag to investors that the founders are not serious about the venture.  Early startups are not able to procure bank loans and venture capitalists often prefer more mature companies. Fortunately in the State of Maryland there is seed funding for startups.  TEDCO’s TechStart program will provide up to $15,000 to fund Maryland university-based or federal lab-based teams, entrepreneur, inventor, and tech transfer managers, to determine whether specific technologies would have the potential to be commercialized through a startup company.  These funds could be used for such things as a freedom to operate analysis or a market analysis.  TEDCO has further funding for the startups. The Maryland Technology Transfer and Commercialization Fund (MTTCF), offers up to $75,000 to Maryland companies for developing technology in conjunction with a Maryland university or Federal lab or to a company in a Maryland incubator, while the Working Capital Loan Fund (WCLF) offers low interest loans of between $15,000 to $50,000 to qualified early-stage companies in the State of Maryland to assist with expansion, market entry, or product launch.  Other funds exist in the State for further funding such as the Maryland Industrial Partnership Program (MIPS), Maryland Biotechnology Center awards, Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development (DBED) Challenge and Enterprise programs, and the Federal Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) awards, and Federal and State tax credits.",,"Collins English Dictionary, Entrepreneur, Federal and State, Kellogg School of Management, MIPS, Maryland Biotechnology Center, Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development, State, TechStart, The Maryland Technology Transfer and Commercialization Fund, the Federal Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR, the Maryland Industrial Partnership Program, the Working Capital Loan Fund"
